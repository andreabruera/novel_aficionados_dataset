<p/>THE Morte D'Arthur was finished, as the epilogue tells us, in the ninth year of Edward IV., i.e. between March 4, 1469 and the same date in 1470.
<p/>It is thus, fitly enough, the last important English book written before the introduction of printing into this country, and since no manuscript of it has come down to us it is also the first English classic for our knowledge of which we are entirely dependent on a printed text.
<p/>How Sir Tristram at a tournament bare the shield that Morgan le Fay delivered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>). BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE Caxton's story of how the book was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>)
<p/>From this we learn also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) was not only the printer of the book, but to some extent its editor also, dividing Malory's work into twenty-one books, splitting up the books into chapters, by no means skilfully, and supplying the <div class="bookquote">``Rubrish''  (<font color='red'><b>Malory/Thomas Malory</b></font>)</div>or chapter-headings.
<p/>It may be added that Caxton's preface contains, moreover, a brief criticism which, on the points on which it touches, is still the soundest and most sympathetic that has been written.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) was induced to print it may be read farther on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) own preface. Caxton finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) edition the last day of July 1485, some fifteen or sixteen years after Malory wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) epilogue.
<p/>It is clear that the author was then dead, or the printer would not have acted as a clumsy editor to the book, and recent discoveries -LRB-if bibliography may, for the moment, enlarge its bounds to mention such matters-RRB- have revealed with tolerable certainty when Malory died and who he (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) was.
<p/>In letters to The Athenaeum in July 1896 Mr. T. Williams pointed out that the name of a Sir Thomas Malorie occurred among those of a number of other Lancastrians excluded from a general pardon granted by Edward IV. in 1468, and that a William Mallerye was mentioned in the same year as taking part in a Lancastrian rising.
<p/>In September 1897, again, in another letter to the same paper, Mr. A. T. Martin reported the finding of the will of a Thomas Malory of Papworth, a hundred partly in Cambridgeshire, partly in Hunts.
<p/>This will was made on September 16, 1469, and as it was proved the 27th of the next month the testator must have been in immediate expectation of death.
<p/>It contains the most careful provision for the education and starting in life of a family of three daughters and seven sons, of whom the youngest seems to have been still an infant.
<p/>We cannot say with certainty that this Thomas Malory, whose last thoughts were so busy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) children, was our author, or that the Lancastrian knight discovered by Mr. Williams was identical with either or both, but such evidence as the Morte D'Arthur offers favours such a belief.
<p/>There is not only the epilogue with its petition, <div class="bookquote">``pray for me while I am alive that God send me good deliverance and when I am dead pray you all for my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>chap</b></font>)</div>but this very request is foreshadowed at the end of chap.
<p/>in the touching passage, surely inspired by personal experience, as to the sickness <div class="bookquote">``that is the greatest pain a prisoner may have'' (<font color='red'><b>an author knight</b></font>)</div>; and the reflections on English fickleness in the first chapter of Book xxi., though the Wars of the Roses might have inspired them in any one, come most naturally from an author who was a Lancastrian knight.
<p/>If the Morte D'Arthur was really written in prison and by a prisoner distressed by ill-health as well as by lack of liberty, surely no task was ever better devised to while away weary hours.
<p/>Leaving abundant scope for originality in selection, modification, and arrangement, as a compilation and translation it had in it that mechanical element which adds the touch of restfulness to literary work.
<p/>No original, it is said, has yet been found for Book vii., and it is possible that none will ever be forthcoming for chap.
<p/>20 of Book xviii., which describes the arrival of the body of the Fair Maiden of Astolat at Arthur's court, or vii for chap.
<p/>25 of the same book, with its discourse on true love; but the great bulk of the work has been traced chapter by chapter to the <div class="bookquote">``Merlin''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert</b></font>)</div>of Robert de Borron and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) successors -LRB-Bks. i.-iv.-RRB-, the English metrical romance La Morte Arthur of the Thornton manuscript
<p/>37 of Book ix. -LRB-Bk. v.-RRB-, the French romances of Tristan -LRB-Bks. viii.-x.-RRB- and of Launcelot -LRB-Bks. vi., xi.-xix.-RRB-, and lastly to the English prose Morte Arthur of Harley MS.
<p/>As to Malory's choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) authorities critics have not failed to point out that now and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) gives a worse version where a better has come down to us, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) had been able to order a complete set of Arthurian manuscripts from his (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) bookseller, no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) would have done even better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) did!
<p/>But of the skill, approaching to original genius, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) used the books from which he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) worked there is little dispute.
<p/>Malory died leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) work obviously unrevised, and in this condition it was brought to Caxton, who prepared it for the press with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) usual enthusiasm in the cause of good literature, and also, it must be added, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malory</b></font>) usual carelessness.
<p/>New chapters are sometimes made to begin in the middle of a sentence, and in addition to simple misprints there are numerous passages in which it is impossible to believe that we have the text as Malory intended it to stand.
<p/>After Caxton's edition Malory's manuscript must have disappeared, and subsequent editions are differentiated only by the degree of closeness with which they follow the first.
<p/>Editions appeared printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1498 and 1529, by William Copland in 1559, by Thomas East about 1585, and by Thomas Stansby in 1634, each printer apparently taking the text of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) immediate predecessor and reproducing it with modifications.
<p/>Stansby's edition served for reprints in 1816 and 1856 -LRB-the latter edited by Thomas Wright-RRB-; but in 1817 an edition supervised by Robert Southey went back to Caxton's text, though to a copy -LRB-only two are extant, and only one perfect!-RRB- in which eleven leaves were supplied from Wynkyn de Worde's reprint.
<p/>In 1868 Sir Edward Strachey produced for the present publishers a reprint of Southey's text in modern spelling, with the substitution of current words for those now obsolete, and the softening of a handful of passages likely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Southey</b></font>) thought, to prevent the book being placed in the hands of boys.
<p/>In 1889 a boon was conferred on scholars by the publication of Dr. H. Oskar Sommer's page-for-page reprint of Caxton's text, with an elaborate discussion of Malory's sources.
<p/>Dr. Sommer's edition was used by Sir E. Strachey to revise his (<font color='blue'><b>Sommer</b></font>) Globe text, and in 1897 Mr. Israel Gollancz produced for the <div class="bookquote">``Temple Classics''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>a very pretty edition in which Sir Edward Strachey's principles of modernisation in spelling and punctuation were adopted, but with the restoration of obsolete words and omitted phrases.
<p/>2252 -LRB-Bks. xviii. , xx. , xxi.-RRB-. As to the present edition, Sir Edward Strachey altered with so sparing a hand
<p/>and that here printed will be looked for in vain; but the most anxious care has been taken to produce a text modernised as to its spelling, but in other respects in accurate accordance with Caxton's text, as represented by Dr Sommer's reprint.
<p/>Obvious misprints have been silently corrected, but in a few cases notes show where emendations have been introduced from Wynkyn de Worde--not that Wynkyn had any more right to emend Caxton than we, but because even a printer's conjecture gains a little sanctity after four centuries.
<p/>The restoration of obsolete words has necessitated a much fuller glossary, and the index of names has therefore been separated from it and enlarged.
<p/>that on many pages differences between his (<font color='blue'><b>Sommer</b></font>) version In its present form the index is the work of Mr. Henry Littlehales.
<p/>PREFACE OF WILLIAM CAXTON AFTER that I had accomplished and finished divers histories, as well of contemplation as of other historial and worldly acts of great conquerors and princes, and also certain books of ensamples and doctrine, many noble and divers gentlemen of this realm of England came and demanded me many and oft times, wherefore that I have not do made and imprint the noble history of the Saint Greal, and of the most renowned Christian king, first and chief of the three best Christian, and worthy, King Arthur, which ought most to be remembered among us Englishmen to-fore all other Christian kings; for it is notoyrly known through the universal world, that there be nine worthy and the best that ever were, that is to wit, three Paynims, three Jews, and three Christian men.
<p/>As for the Paynims, they were to-fore the Incarnation of Christ, which were named, the first Hector of Troy, of whom the history is comen both in ballad and in prose, the second Alexander the Great, and the third Julius Caesar, Emperor of Rome, of whom the histories be well known and had.
<p/>And as for the three Jews, which also were to-fore the incarnation of our Lord, of whom the first was duke Joshua which brought the children of Israel into the land of behest, the second David king of Jerusalem, and the third Judas Machabeus, of these three the Bible rehearseth all their noble histories and acts.
<p/>And since the said Incarnation have been three noble Christian men, stalled and admitted through the universal world into the number of the nine best and worthy.
<p/>A. W. POLLARD. Of whom was first the noble Arthur, whose noble acts I purpose to write in this present book here following.
<p/>The second was Charlemain, or Charles the Great, of whom the history is had in many places, both in French and in English.
<p/>And the third and last was Godfrey of Boloine, of whose acts and life I made a book unto the excellent prince and king of noble memory, King Edward the Fourth.
<p/>The said noble gentlemen instantly required me to imprint the history of the said noble king and conqueror King Arthur, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights, with the history of the Saint Greal, and of the death and ending of the said Arthur; affirming that I ought rather to imprint his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) acts and noble feats, than of Godfrey of Boloine, or any of the other eight, considering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Godfrey</b></font>) was a man born within this realm, and king and emperor of the same: and that there be in French divers and many noble volumes of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) acts, and also of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knights.
<p/>To whom I answered that divers men hold opinion that there was no such Arthur, and that all such books as been made of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) be feigned and fables, because that some chronicles make of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) no mention, nor remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nothing, nor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights.
<p/>Whereto they answered, and one in special said, that in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) that should say or think that there was never such a king called Arthur might well be aretted great folly and blindness.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said that there were many evidences of the contrary. First ye may see his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sepulchre in the monastery of Glastonbury.
<p/>And also in Policronicon, in the fifth book the sixth chapter, and in the seventh book the twenty-third chapter, where his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) body was buried, and after found, and translated into the said monastery.
<p/>Ye shall see also in the history of Bochas, in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) book De Casu Principum, part of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) noble acts, and also of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fall.
<p/>Also Galfridus in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) British book recounteth his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life: and in divers places of England many remembrances be yet of him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and shall remain perpetually, and also of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knights.
<p/>First in the abbey of Westminster, at St. Edward's shrine, remaineth the print of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seal in red wax closed in beryl, in which is written, Patricius Arthurus Britannie, Gallie, Germanie, Dacie, Imperator.
<p/>Item in the castle of Dover ye may see Gawaine's skull, and Cradok's mantle: at Winchester the Round Table: in other places Launcelot's sword and many other things.
<p/>Then all these things considered, there can no man reasonably gainsay but there was a king of this land named Arthur.
<p/>For in all places, Christian and heathen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is reputed and taken for one of the nine worthy, and the first of the three Christian men.
<p/>more books made of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) noble acts, than there be in England, as well in Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Greekish, as in French.
<p/>And yet of record remain in witness of him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) in Wales, in the town of Camelot, the great stones and the marvellous works of iron lying under the ground, and royal vaults, which divers now living have seen.
<p/>Wherefore it is a marvel why he (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) is no more renowned in his (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) own country, save only it accordeth to the Word of God, which saith that no man is accepted for a prophet in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own country.
<p/>Then all these things aforesaid alleged, I could not well deny but that there was such a noble king named Arthur, and reputed one of the nine worthy, and first and chief of the Christian men.
<p/>And many noble volumes be made of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) noble knights in French, which I have seen and read beyond the sea, which be not had in our maternal tongue.
<p/>And also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is more spoken of beyond the sea, But in Welsh be many and also in French, and some in English but nowhere nigh all.
<p/>Wherefore, such as have late been drawn out briefly into English I have after the simple conning that God hath sent to me, under the favour and correction of all noble lords and gentlemen, enprised to imprint a book of the noble histories of the said King Arthur, and of certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights, after a copy unto me delivered, which copy Sir Thomas Malorye did take out of certain books of French, and reduced it into English.
<p/>And I, according to my copy, have done set it in imprint, to the intent that noble men may see and learn the noble acts of chivalry, the gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights used in those days, by which they came to honour, and how they that were vicious were punished and oft put to shame and rebuke; humbly beseeching all noble lords and ladies, with all other estates of what estate or degree they been of, that shall see and read in this said book and work, that they take the good and honest acts in their remembrance, and to follow the same.
<p/>Wherein they shall find many joyous and pleasant histories, and noble and renowned acts of humanity, gentleness, and chivalry. For herein may be seen noble chivalry, courtesy, humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship, cowardice, murder, hate, virtue, and sin.
<p/>And for to pass the time this book shall be pleasant to read in, but for to give faith and belief that all is true that is contained herein, ye be at your liberty: but all is written for our doctrine, and for to beware that we fall not to vice nor sin, but to exercise and follow virtue, by which we may come and attain to good fame and renown in this life, and after this short and transitory life to come unto everlasting bliss in heaven; the which He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) grant us that reigneth in heaven, the blessed Trinity.
<p/>Then to proceed forth in this said book, which I direct unto all noble princes, lords and ladies, gentlemen or gentlewomen, that desire to read or hear read of the noble and joyous history of the great conqueror and excellent king, King Arthur, sometime king of this noble realm, then called Britain; I, William Caxton, simple person, present this book following, which I have enprised to imprint: and treateth of the noble acts, feats of arms of chivalry, prowess, hardiness, humanity, love, courtesy, and very gentleness, with many wonderful histories and adventures.
<p/>And for to understand briefly the content of this volume, I have divided it into XXI Books, and every book chaptered, as hereafter shall by God's grace follow.
<p/>Do after the good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renown. Amen. The First Book shall treat how Uther Pendragon gat the noble conqueror King Arthur, and containeth xxviii chapters.

<p/>The Twentieth Book treateth of the piteous death of Arthur, and containeth xxii chapters. BOOK I CHAPTER I. How Uther Pendragon sent for the duke of Cornwall and Igraine his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wife, and of their departing suddenly again.
<p/>IT befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was king of all England, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that held war against him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) long time.
<p/>And so by means King Uther sent for this duke, charging him (<font color='blue'><b>Uther</b></font>) to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Uther</b></font>) wife with him (<font color='blue'><b>Uther</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was called a fair lady, and a passing wise, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) name was called Igraine.
<p/>So when the duke and his (<font color='blue'><b>Uther</b></font>) wife were come unto the king, by the means of great lords they were accorded both.
<p/>The king liked and loved this lady well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) made them great cheer out of measure, and desired to have lain by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>And the duke was called the Duke of Tintagil. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a passing good woman, and would not assent unto the king.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told the duke her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, and said, I suppose that we were sent for that I should be dishonoured; wherefore, husband, I counsel you, that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may ride all night unto our own castle.
<p/>And in like wise as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said so they departed, that neither the king nor none of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) council were ware of their departing.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) privy council, and told them of the sudden departing of the duke and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Then they advised the king to send for the duke and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife by a great charge; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will not come at your summons, then may ye do your best, then have ye cause to make mighty war upon him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>So that was done, and the messengers had their answers; and that was this shortly, that neither he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) nor his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife would not come at him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>All so soon as King Uther knew of their departing so suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was wonderly wroth. Then was the king wonderly wroth.
<p/>And then the king sent him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) plain word again, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) be ready and stuff him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and garnish him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), for within forty days he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) out of the biggest castle that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hath.
<p/>When the duke had this warning, anon he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) went and furnished and garnished two strong castles of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), of the which the one hight Tintagil, and the other castle hight Terrabil.
<p/>So his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife Dame Igraine he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) put in the castle of Tintagil, and himself he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) put in the castle of Terrabil, the which had many issues and posterns out.
<p/>Then in all haste came Uther with a great host, and laid a siege about the castle of Terrabil. And there he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) pight many pavilions, and there was great war made on both parties, and much people slain.
<p/>Then for pure anger and for great love of fair Igraine the king Uther fell sick. So came to the king Uther Sir Ulfius, a noble knight, and asked the king why he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was sick.
<p/>I shall tell thee, said the king, I am sick for anger and for love of fair Igraine, that I may not be whole.
<p/>Well, my lord, said Sir Ulfius, I shall seek Merlin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) shall do you remedy, that your heart shall be pleased.
<p/>So Ulfius departed, and by adventure he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) met Merlin in a beggar's array, and there Merlin asked Ulfius whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) sought.
<p/>Well, said Merlin, I know whom thou seekest, for thou seekest Merlin; therefore seek no farther, for I am he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>); and if King Uther will well reward me, and be sworn unto me to fulfil my desire, that shall be his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) honour and profit more than mine; for I shall cause him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to have all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) desire.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had little ado to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). All this will I undertake, said Ulfius, that there shall be nothing reasonable but thou shalt have thy desire.
<p/>Well, said Merlin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) shall have his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) intent and desire. And therefore, said Merlin, ride on your way, for I will not be long behind.
<p/>How Uther Pendragon made war on the duke of Cornwall, and how by the mean of Merlin he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) lay by the duchess and gat Arthur.
<p/>THEN Ulfius was glad, and rode on more than a pace till that he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) came to King Uther Pendragon, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had met with Merlin.
<p/>CHAPTER II. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>)? said the king. Sir, said Ulfius, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will not dwell long. Therewithal Ulfius was ware where Merlin stood at the porch of the pavilion's door.
<p/>And then Merlin was bound to come to the king. When King Uther saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Uther</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Uther</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Uther</b></font>) was welcome. Sir, said Merlin, I know all your heart
<p/>every deal; so ye will be sworn unto me as ye be a true king anointed, to fulfil my desire, ye shall have your desire.
<p/>the first night that ye shall lie by Igraine ye shall get a child on her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>), and when that is born, that it shall be delivered to me for to nourish there as I will have it; for it shall be your worship, and the child's avail, as mickle as the child is worth.
<p/>Then the king was sworn upon the Four Evangelists. Sir, said Merlin, this is my desire: I will well, said the king, as thou wilt have it.
<p/>ye shall be like the duke her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) husband, Ulfius shall be like Sir Brastias, a knight of the duke's, and I will be like a knight
<p/>Now make you ready, said Merlin, this night ye shall lie with Igraine in the castle of Tintagil; and that hight Sir Jordanus, a knight of the duke's.
<p/>But wait ye make not many questions with her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) men, but say ye are diseased, and so hie you to bed, and rise not on the morn till I come to you, for the castle of Tintagil is but ten miles hence; so this was done as they devised.
<p/>But the duke of Tintagil espied how the king rode from the siege of Terrabil, and therefore that night he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) issued out of the castle at a postern for to have distressed the king's host.
<p/>And so, through his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own issue, the duke himself was slain or ever the king came at the castle of Tintagil.
<p/>So after the death of the duke, King Uther lay with Igraine more than three hours after his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) death, and begat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) that night Arthur, and on day came Merlin to the king, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) make him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ready, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) kissed the lady Igraine and departed in all haste.
<p/>But when the lady heard tell of the duke her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, and by all record he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was dead or ever King Uther came to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) marvelled who that might be that lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in likeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord; so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mourned privily and held her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) peace.
<p/>Then all the barons by one assent prayed the king of accord betwixt the lady Igraine and him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ; the king gave them leave, for fain would he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) have been accorded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>).
<p/>So the king put all the trust in Ulfius to entreat between them, so by the entreaty at the last the king and she (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) met together.
<p/>Now will we do well, said Ulfius, our king is a lusty knight and wifeless, and my lady Igraine is a passing fair lady; it were great joy unto us all, an it might please the king to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) queen.
<p/>And anon, like a lusty knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) assented thereto with good will, and so in all haste they were married in a morning with great mirth and joy.
<p/>And King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney then wedded Margawse that was Gawaine's mother, and King Nentres of the land of Garlot wedded Elaine.
<p/>Unto that they all well accorded and moved it to the king. All this was done at the request of King Uther.
<p/>And the third sister Morgan le Fay was put to school in a nunnery, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) learned so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a great clerk of necromancy.
<p/>And after she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was wedded to King Uriens of the land of Gore, that was Sir Ewain's le Blanchemain's father. CHAPTER III.
<p/>Queen Igraine waxed daily greater and greater, so it befell after within half a year, as King Uther lay by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) queen, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), by the faith she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) owed to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), whose was the body; then she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) sore abashed to give answer.
<p/>Dismay you not, said the king, but tell me the truth, and I shall love you the better, by the faith of my body.
<p/>The same night that my lord was dead, the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) death, as his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knights record, there came into my castle of Tintagil a man like my lord in speech and in countenance, and two knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) in likeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) two knights Brastias and Jordanus, and so I went unto bed with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) as I ought to do with my lord, and the same night, as I shall answer unto God, this child was begotten upon me.
<p/>That is truth, said the king, as ye say; for it was I myself that came in the likeness, and therefore dismay you not, for I am father of the child; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) all the cause, how it was by Merlin's counsel.
<p/>Of the birth of King Arthur and of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) nurture. THEN Sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), I shall tell you the truth. Then the queen made great joy when she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) knew who was the father of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) child.
<p/>Soon came Merlin unto the king, and said, Sir, ye must purvey you for the nourishing of your child. As thou wilt, said the king, be it.
<p/>Well, said Merlin, I know a lord of yours in this land, that is a passing true man and a faithful, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall have the nourishing of your child, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name is Sir Ector, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a lord of fair livelihood in many parts in England and Wales; and this lord, Sir Ector, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) be sent for, for to come and speak with you, and desire him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) yourself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) loveth you, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) will put his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) own child to nourishing to another woman, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) wife nourish yours.
<p/>And when the child is born let it be delivered to me at yonder privy postern unchristened. So like as Merlin devised it was done.
<p/>And when Sir Ector was come he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) made fiaunce to the king for to nourish the child like as the king desired; and there the king granted Sir Ector great rewards.
<p/>Then when the lady was delivered, the king commanded two knights and two ladies to take the child, bound in a cloth of gold, and that ye deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to what poor man ye meet at the postern gate of the castle.
<p/>So the child was delivered unto Merlin, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) bare it forth unto Sir Ector, and made an holy man to christen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and named him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Arthur; and so Sir Ector's wife nourished him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own pap.
<p/>CHAPTER IV. Of the death of King Uther Pendragon. THEN within two years King Uther fell sick of a great malady.
<p/>And in the meanwhile his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) enemies usurped upon him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and did a great battle upon his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) men, and slew many of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) people.
<p/>Sir, said Merlin, ye may not lie so as ye do, for ye must to the field though ye ride on an horse-litter: for ye shall never have the better of your enemies but if your person be there, and then shall ye have the victory.
<p/>So it was done as Merlin had devised, and they carried the king forth in an horse-litter with a great host towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) enemies.
<p/>And that day Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias did great deeds of arms, and King Uther's men overcame the Northern battle and slew many people, and put the remnant to flight.
<p/>And at St. Albans there met with the king a great host of the North. And then the king returned unto London, and made great joy of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) victory.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fell passing sore sick, so that three days and three nights he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was speechless: wherefore all the barons made great sorrow, and asked Merlin what counsel were best.
<p/>There is none other remedy, said Merlin, but God will have his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) will. But look ye all barons be before King Uther to-morn, and God and I shall make him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to speak.
<p/>So on the morn all the barons with Merlin came to-fore the king; then Merlin said aloud unto King Uther, Sir, shall your son Arthur be king after your days, of this realm with all the appurtenance?
<p/>Then Uther Pendragon turned him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and said in hearing of them all, I give him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) God's blessing and mine, and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pray for my soul, and righteously and worshipfully that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) claim the crown, upon forfeiture of my blessing; and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) yielded up the ghost, and then was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) interred as longed to a king.
<p/>How Arthur was chosen king, and of wonders and marvels of a sword taken out of a stone by the said Arthur.
<p/>THEN stood the realm in great jeopardy long while, for every lord that was mighty of men made him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) strong, and many weened to have been king.
<p/>Then Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) for to send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of arms, that they should to London come by Christmas, upon pain of cursing; and for this cause, that Jesus, that was born on that night, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) would of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) great mercy show some miracle, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was come to be king of mankind, for to show some miracle who should be rightwise king of this realm.
<p/>So the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent for all the lords and gentlemen of arms that they should come by Christmas even unto London.
<p/>Wherefore the queen, fair Igraine, made great sorrow, and all the barons. CHAPTER V. And many of them made them clean of their life, that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto God.
<p/>So in the greatest church of London, whether it were Paul's or not the French book maketh no mention, all the estates were long or day in the church for to pray.
<p/>And when matins and the first mass was done, there was seen in the churchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four square, like unto a marble stone; and in midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point, and letters there were written in gold about the sword that said thus:--Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise king born of all England.
<p/>I command, said the Archbishop, that ye keep you within your church and pray unto God still, that no man touch the sword till the high mass be all done.
<p/>Then the people marvelled, and told it to the Archbishop. So when all masses were done all the lords went to behold the stone and the sword.
<p/>And when they saw the scripture some assayed, such as would have been king. But none might stir the sword nor move it.
<p/>But this is my counsel, said the Archbishop, that we let purvey ten knights, men of good fame, and they to keep this sword.
<p/>So it was ordained, and then there was made a cry, that every man should assay that would, for to win the sword.
<p/>And upon New Year's Day the barons let make a jousts and a tournament, that all knights that would joust or tourney there might play, and all this was ordained for to keep the lords together and the commons, for the Archbishop trusted that God would make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) known that should win the sword.
<p/>So upon New Year's Day, when the service was done, the barons rode unto the field, some to joust and some to tourney, and so it happened that Sir Ector, that had great livelihood about London, rode unto the jousts, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) rode Sir Kay his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) son, and young Arthur that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) nourished brother; and Sir Kay was made knight at All Hallowmass afore.
<p/>So as they rode to the jousts-ward, Sir Kay lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) sword, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) had left it at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) father's lodging, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) prayed young Arthur for to ride for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) sword.
<p/>I will well, said Arthur, and rode fast after the sword, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came home, the lady and all were out to see the jousting.
<p/>Then was Arthur wroth, and said to himself, I will ride to the churchyard, and take the sword with me that sticketh in the stone, for my brother Sir Kay shall not be without a sword this day.
<p/>So when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) came to the churchyard, Sir Arthur alighted and tied his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse to the stile, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went to the tent, and found no knights there, for they were at the jousting.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) handled the sword by the handles, and lightly and fiercely pulled it out of the stone, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse and rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) way until he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) brother Sir Kay, and delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) the sword.
<p/>And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) wist well it was the sword of the stone, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) rode to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) father Sir Ector, and said: Sir, lo here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I must be king of this land.
<p/>When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) returned again and came to the church, and there they alighted all three, and went into the church.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) is not here, said the Archbishop, that shall achieve the sword, but doubt not God will make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) known. And anon he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made Sir Kay swear upon a book how he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) came to that sword.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Kay, by my brother Arthur, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) brought it to me. How gat ye this sword? said Sir Ector to Arthur.
<p/>When I came home for my brother's sword, I found nobody at home to deliver me his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword; and so I thought my brother Sir Kay should not be swordless,
<p/>Sir, I will tell you. and so I came hither eagerly and pulled it out of the stone without any pain.
<p/>Found ye any knights about this sword? said Sir Ector. Nay, said Arthur. Now, said Sir Ector to Arthur, I understand ye must be king of this land.
<p/>Wherefore I, said Arthur, and for what cause? Sir, said Ector, for God will have it so; for there should never man have drawn out this sword, but
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) that shall be rightwise king of this land. Now let me see whether ye can put the sword there as it was, and pull it out again.
<p/>That is no mastery, said Arthur, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) put it in the stone ; wherewithal Sir Ector assayed to pull out the sword and failed.
<p/>CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur pulled out the sword divers times. Now assay, said Sir Ector unto Sir Kay. And anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) pulled at the sword with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) might; but it would not be.
<p/>Now shall ye assay, said Sir Ector to Arthur. I will well, said Arthur, and pulled it out easily. And therewithal Sir Ector knelt down to the earth, and Sir Kay.
<p/>Alas, said Arthur, my own dear father and brother, why kneel ye to me? Nay, nay, my lord Arthur, it is not so;
<p/>I was never your father nor of your blood, but I wot well ye are of an higher blood than I weened ye
<p/>And then Sir Ector told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) all, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) was betaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) for to nourish him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>), and by whose commandment, and by Merlin's deliverance.
<p/>were. Then Arthur made great dole when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) understood that Sir Ector was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) father. Sir, said Ector unto Arthur, will ye be my good and gracious lord when ye are king?
<p/>Else were I to blame, said Arthur, for ye are the man in the world that I am most beholden to, and my good lady and mother your wife, that as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own hath fostered me and kept.
<p/>And if ever it be God's will that I be king as ye say, ye shall desire of me what I may do, and I shall not fail you; God forbid I should fail you Sir, said Sir Ector, I will ask no more of you, but that ye will make my son, your foster brother, Sir Kay, seneschal of all your lands.
<p/>That shall be done, said Arthur, and more, by the faith of my body, that never man shall have that office
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and I live Therewithal they went unto the Archbishop, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) how the sword was achieved, and by whom; and on Twelfth-day all the barons came thither, and to assay to take the sword, who that would assay.
<p/>Arthur; wherefore there were many lords wroth, and said it was great shame unto them all and the realm, to be overgoverned with a boy of no high blood born.
<p/>And so they fell out at that time that it was put off till Candlemas and then all the barons should meet there again;
<p/>but always the ten knights were ordained to watch the sword day and night, and so they set a pavilion over the stone and the sword, and five always watched.
<p/>But there afore them all, there might none take it out but So at Candlemas many more great lords came thither for to have won the sword, but there might none prevail.
<p/>And right as Arthur did at Christmas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did at Candlemas, and pulled out the sword easily, whereof the barons were sore aggrieved and put it off in delay till the high feast of Easter.
<p/>And as Arthur sped before, so did he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) at Easter; yet there were some of the great lords had indignation that Arthur should be king, and put it off in a delay till the feast of Pentecost.
<p/>Then the Archbishop of Canterbury by Merlin's providence let purvey then of the best knights that they might get, and such knights as Uther Pendragon loved best and most trusted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) days.
<p/>And such knights were put about Arthur as Sir Baudwin of Britain, Sir Kay, Sir Ulfius, Sir Brastias. All these, with many other, were always about Arthur, day and night, till the feast of Pentecost.
<p/>AND at the feast of Pentecost all manner of men assayed to pull at the sword that would assay; but none might prevail but Arthur, and pulled it out afore all the lords and commons that were there, wherefore all the commons cried at once, We will have Arthur unto our king
<p/>, we will put him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) no more in delay, for we all see that it is God's will that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shall be our king, and who that holdeth against it, we will slay him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>And therewithal they kneeled at once, both rich and poor, and cried Arthur mercy because they had delayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) so long, and Arthur forgave them, and took the sword between both his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands, and offered it upon the altar where the Archbishop was, and so was he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) made knight of the best man that was there.
<p/>And there was he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) sworn unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) lords and the commons for to be a true king, to stand with true justice from thenceforth the days of this life.
<p/>Also then he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) made all lords that held of the crown to come in, and to do service as they ought to do.
<p/>And many complaints were made unto Sir Arthur of great wrongs that were done since the death of King Uther, of many lands that were bereaved lords, knights, ladies, and gentlemen.
<p/>CHAPTER VII. How King Arthur was crowned, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made officers. And so anon was the coronation made. Wherefore King Arthur made the lands to be given again unto them that owned them.
<p/>When this was done, that the king had stablished all the countries about London, then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) let make Sir Kay seneschal of England; and Sir Baudwin of Britain was made constable; and Sir Ulfius was made chamberlain; and Sir Brastias was made warden to wait upon the north from Trent forwards, for it was that time the most party the king's enemies.
<p/>Also Wales, a part of it, held against Arthur, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) overcame them all, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did the remnant, through the noble prowess of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights of the Round Table.
<p/>How King Arthur held in Wales, at a Pentecost, a great feast, and what kings and lords came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) feast.
<p/>THEN the king removed into Wales, and let cry a great feast that it should be holden at Pentecost after the incoronation of him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) at the city of Carlion.
<p/>But within few years after Arthur won all the north, Scotland, and all that were under their obeissance. CHAPTER VIII. Unto the feast came King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney, with five hundred knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>Also there came to the feast King Uriens of Gore with four hundred knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). Also there came to that feast King Nentres of Garlot, with seven hundred knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>Also there came to the feast the king of Scotland with six hundred knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was but a young man.
<p/>Also there came to the feast a king that was called the King with the Hundred Knights, but he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) men were passing well beseen at all points.
<p/>And King Arthur was glad of their coming, for he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) weened that all the kings and knights had come for great love, and to have done him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) worship at his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) feast; wherefore the king made great joy, and sent the kings and knights great presents.
<p/>But the kings would none receive, but rebuked the messengers shamefully, and said they had no joy to receive no gifts of a beardless boy that was come of low blood, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) word they would none of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gifts, but that they were come to give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gifts with hard swords betwixt the neck and the shoulders: and therefore they came thither
<p/>, so they told to the messengers plainly, for it was great shame to all them to see such a boy to have a rule of so noble a realm as this land was.
<p/>Also there came the king of Carados with five hundred knights. With this answer the messengers departed and told to King Arthur this answer.
<p/>Wherefore, by the advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) barons, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to a strong tower with five hundred good men with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>And all the kings aforesaid in a manner laid a siege to-fore him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), but King Arthur was well victualed. And within fifteen days there came Merlin among them into the city of Carlion.
<p/>Then all the kings were passing glad of Merlin, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>), For what cause is that boy Arthur made your king?
<p/>Sirs, said Merlin, I shall tell you the cause, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) is King Uther Pendragon's son, born in wedlock, gotten on Igraine, the duke's wife of Tintagil.
<p/>Nay, said Merlin, after the death of the duke, more than three hours, was Arthur begotten, and thirteen days after King Uther wedded Igraine; and therefore I prove him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is no bastard.
<p/>And who saith nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) shall be king and overcome all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) enemies; and, or he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) die, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shall be long king of all England, and have under his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) obeissance Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and more realms than I will now rehearse.
<p/>Some of the kings had marvel of Merlin's words, and deemed well that it should be as he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) said; and some of them laughed him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) to scorn, as King Lot; and more other called him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a witch.
<p/>But then were they accorded with Merlin, that King Arthur should come out and speak with the kings, and to come safe and to go safe, such surance there was made.
<p/>So Merlin went unto King Arthur, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had done, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fear not, but come out boldly and speak with them, and spare them not, but answer them as their king and chieftain; for ye shall overcome them all, whether they will or nill.
<p/>Then is he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) a bastard, they said all. CHAPTER IX. Of the first war that King Arthur had, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) won the field.
<p/>THEN King Arthur came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) tower, and had under his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) gown a jesseraunt of double mail, and there went with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir Baudwin of Britain, and Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias: these were the men of most worship that were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>).
<p/>And when they were met there was no meekness, but stout words on both sides; but always King Arthur answered them, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would make them to bow an he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lived.
<p/>Wherefore they departed with wrath, and King Arthur bade keep them well, and they bade the king keep him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) well. So the king returned him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to the tower again and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knights.
<p/>What will ye do? said Merlin to the kings; ye were better for to stint, for ye shall not here prevail though ye were ten times so many.
<p/>With that Merlin vanished away, and came to King Arthur, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) set on them fiercely; and in the meanwhile there were three hundred good men, of the best that were with the kings, that went straight unto King Arthur, and that comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) greatly.
<p/>Sir, said Merlin to Arthur, fight not with the sword that ye had by miracle, till that ye see ye go unto the worse, then draw it out and do your best.
<p/>Be we well advised to be afeared of a dream-reader? said King Lot. So forthwithal King Arthur set upon them in their lodging.
<p/>And Sir Baudwin, Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it was marvel; and always King Arthur on horseback laid on with a sword, and did marvellous deeds of arms, that many of the kings had great joy of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) deeds and hardiness.
<p/>Then King Lot brake out on the back side, and the King with the Hundred Knights, and King Carados, and set on Arthur fiercely behind him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>With that Sir Arthur turned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights, and smote behind and before, and ever Sir Arthur was in the foremost press till his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse was slain underneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword Excalibur, but it was so bright in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) enemies' eyes, that it gave light like thirty torches.
<p/>And therewith King Lot smote down King Arthur. With that his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) four knights received him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and set him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) on horseback. And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) put them a-back, and slew much people.
<p/>And then the commons of Carlion arose with clubs and staves and slew many knights; but all the kings held them together with their knights that were left alive, and so fled and departed.
<p/>How Merlin counselled King Arthur to send for King Ban and King Bors, and of their counsel taken for the war.
<p/>SO after the feast and journey, King Arthur drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) unto London, and so by the counsel of Merlin, the king let call his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) barons to council, for Merlin had told the king that the six kings that made war upon him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would in all haste be awroke on him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lands.
<p/>And Merlin came unto Arthur, and counselled him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to follow them no further. CHAPTER X. Wherefore the king asked counsel at them all.
<p/>Ye say well, said Arthur; I thank you for your good courage, but will ye all that loveth me speak with Merlin?
<p/>ye know well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) hath done much for me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) knoweth many things, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) is afore you, I would that ye prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) heartily of his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) best advice.
<p/>They could no counsel give, but said they were big enough. All the barons said they would pray him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) and desire him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>).
<p/>I shall say you, said Merlin, I warn you all, your enemies are passing strong for you, and they are good men of arms as be alive, and by this time they have gotten to them four kings more, and a mighty duke; and unless that our king have more chivalry with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) may make within the bounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own realm, an he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fight with them in battle, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shall be overcome and slain.
<p/>So Merlin was sent for, and fair desired of all the barons to give them best counsel. What were best to do in this cause? said all the barons.
<p/>I shall tell you, said Merlin, mine advice; there are two brethren beyond the sea, and they be kings both, and marvellous good men of their hands; and that one hight King Ban of Benwick, and that other hight King Bors of Gaul, that is France.
<p/>And on these two kings warreth a mighty man of men, the King Claudas, and striveth with them for a castle, and great war
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) getteth good knights, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) putteth these two kings most part to the worse; wherefore this is my counsel, that our king and sovereign lord send unto the kings Ban and Bors by two trusty knights with letters
<p/>well devised, that an they will come and see King Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) court, and so help him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wars, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will be sworn unto them to help them in their wars against King Claudas.
<p/>is betwixt them. But this Claudas is so mighty of goods whereof Now, what say ye unto this counsel? said Merlin.
<p/>This is well counselled, said the king and all the barons. Right so in all haste there were ordained to go two knights on the message unto the two kings.
<p/>Ulfius and Brastias were made the messengers, and so rode forth well horsed and well armed and as the guise was that time, and so passed the sea and rode toward the city of Benwick.
<p/>And there besides were eight knights that espied them, and at a strait passage they met with Ulfius and Brastias, and would have taken them prisoners; so they prayed them that they might pass, for they were messengers unto King Ban and Bors sent from King Arthur.
<p/>So were there made letters in the pleasant wise according unto King Arthur's desire. Therefore, said the eight knights, ye shall die or be prisoners, for we be knights of King Claudas.
<p/>And therewith two of them dressed their spears, and Ulfius and Brastias dressed their spears, and ran together with great raundom.
<p/>And Claudas' knights brake their spears, and theirs to-held and bare the two knights out of their saddles to the earth, and so left them lying, and rode their ways.
<p/>And the other six knights rode afore to a passage to meet with them again, and so Ulfius and Brastias smote other two down, and so passed on their ways.
<p/>And at the fourth passage there met two for two, and both were laid unto the earth; so there was none of the eight knights
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Claudas</b></font>) was sore hurt or bruised. And when they come to Benwick it fortuned there were both kings, Ban and Bors.
<p/>And when it was told the kings that there were come messengers, there were sent unto them two knights of worship, the one hight Lionses, lord of the country of Payarne, and Sir Phariance a worshipful knight.
<p/>Anon they asked from whence they came, and they said from King Arthur, king of England; so they took them in their arms and made great joy each of other.
<p/>they were messengers of Arthur's, there was made no tarrying, but forthwith they spake with the knights, and welcomed them in the faithfullest wise, and said they were most welcome unto them before all the kings living; and therewith they kissed the letters and delivered them.
<p/>But anon, as the two kings wist And when Ban and Bors understood the letters, then they were more welcome than they were before.
<p/>And after the haste of the letters they gave them this answer, that they would fulfil the desire of King Arthur's writing, and Ulfius and Brastias, tarry there as long as they would, they should have such cheer as might be made them in those marches.
<p/>Then Ulfius and Brastias told the kings of the adventure at their passages of the eight knights. Ha! ah! said Ban and Bors, they were my good friends.
<p/>So Ulfius and Brastias had good cheer and great gifts, as much as they might bear away; and had their answer by mouth and by writing, that those two kings would come unto Arthur in all the haste that they might.
<p/>So the two knights rode on afore, and passed the sea, and came to their lord, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) how they had sped, whereof King Arthur was passing glad.
<p/>I would I had wist of them; they should not have escaped so. At what time suppose ye the two kings will be here?
<p/>Sir, said they, afore All Hallowmass. Then the king let purvey for a great feast, and let cry a great jousts.
<p/>And by All Hallowmass the two kings were come over the sea with three hundred knights well arrayed both for the peace and for the war.
<p/>And King Arthur met with them ten mile out of London, and there was great joy as could be thought or made.
<p/>And on All Hallowmass at the great feast, sat in the hall the three kings, and Sir Kay seneschal served in the hall, and Sir Lucas the butler, that was Duke Corneus' son, and Sir Griflet, that was the son of Cardol, these three knights had the rule of all the service that served the kings.
<p/>And anon, as they had washen and risen, all knights that would joust made them ready; by then they were ready on horseback
<p/>And Arthur, Ban, and Bors, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir Ector, Kay's father, they were in a place covered with cloth of gold like an hall, with ladies and gentlewomen, for to behold who did best, and thereon to give judgment.
<p/>Of a great tourney made by King Arthur and the two kings Ban and Bors, and how they went over the sea.
<p/>there were seven hundred knights. CHAPTER XI. AND King Arthur and the two kings let depart the seven hundred knights in two parties.
<p/>And there were three hundred knights of the realm of Benwick and of Gaul turned on the other side. Then they dressed their shields, and began to couch their spears many good knights.
<p/>So Griflet was the first that met with a knight, one Ladinas, and they met so eagerly that all men had wonder; and they so fought that their shields fell to pieces, and horse and man fell to the earth; and both the French knight and the English knight lay so long that all men weened they had been dead.
<p/>When Lucas the butler saw Griflet so lie, he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) horsed him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) again anon, and they two did marvellous deeds of arms with many bachelors.
<p/>But Sir Kay did that day marvellous deeds of arms, that there was none did so well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) that day.
<p/>Also Sir Kay came out of an ambushment with five knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and they six smote other six down. Then there came Ladinas and Gracian, two knights of France, and did passing well, that all men praised them.
<p/>Then came there Sir Placidas, a good knight, and met with Sir Kay, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) down horse and man, where fore Sir Griflet was wroth, and met with Sir Placidas so hard, that horse and man fell to the earth.
<p/>But when the five knights wist that Sir Kay had a fall, they were wroth out of wit, and therewith each of them five bare down a knight.
<p/>When King Arthur and the two kings saw them begin to wax wroth on both parties, they leapt on small hackneys, and let cry that all men should depart unto their lodging.
<p/>And after, the three kings went into a garden, and gave the prize unto Sir Kay, and to Lucas the butler, and unto Sir Griflet.
<p/>And then they went unto council, and with them Gwenbaus, the brother unto Sir Ban and Bors, a wise clerk, and thither went Ulfius and Brastias, and Merlin.
<p/>And so they went home and unarmed them, and so to evensong and supper. And after they had been in council, they went unto bed.
<p/>And on the morn they heard mass, and to dinner, and so to their council, and made many arguments what were best to do.
<p/>At the last they were concluded, that Merlin should go with a token of King Ban, and that was a ring, unto his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) men and King Bors'; and Gracian and Placidas should go again and keep their castles and their countries, as for -LSB-dread of King Claudas-RSB- King Ban of Benwick, and King Bors of Gaul had ordained them, and so passed the sea and came to Benwick.
<p/>And when the people saw King Ban's ring, and Gracian and Placidas, they were glad, and asked how the kings fared, and made great joy of their welfare and cording, and according unto the sovereign lords desire, the men of war made them ready in all haste possible, so that they were fifteen thousand on horse and foot, and they had great plenty of victual with them, by Merlin's provision.
<p/>But Gracian and Placidas were left to furnish and garnish the castles, for dread of King Claudas. Right so Merlin passed the sea, well victualled both by water and by land.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) came to the sea he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) sent home the footmen again, and took no more with him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) but ten thousand men on horseback, the most part men of arms, and so shipped and passed the sea into England, and landed at Dover; and through the wit of Merlin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) had the host northward, the priviest way that could be thought, unto the forest of Bedegraine, and there in a valley he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) lodged them secretly.
<p/>Then rode Merlin unto Arthur and the two kings, and told them how he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) had sped; whereof they had great marvel, that man on earth might speed so soon, and go and come.
<p/>So Merlin told them ten thousand were in the forest of Bedegraine, well armed at all points. Then was there no more to say, but to horseback went all the host as Arthur had afore purveyed.
<p/>So with twenty thousand he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) passed by night and day, but there was made such an ordinance afore by Merlin, that there should no man of war ride nor go in no country on this side Trent water, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) had a token from King Arthur, where through the king's enemies durst not ride as they did to-fore to espy.
<p/>AND SO within a little space the three kings came unto the castle of Bedegraine, and found there a passing fair fellowship, and well beseen, whereof
<p/>CHAPTER XII. How eleven kings gathered a great host against King Arthur. they had great joy, and victual they wanted none.
<p/>This was the cause of the northern host: that they were reared for the despite and rebuke the six kings had at Carlion.
<p/>And those six kings by their means, gat unto them five other kings; and thus they began to gather their people.
<p/>And now they sware that for weal nor woe, they should not leave other, till they had destroyed Arthur. And then they made an oath.
<p/>The first that began the oath was the Duke of Cambenet, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) five thousand men of arms, the which were ready on horseback.
<p/>Then sware King Brandegoris of Stranggore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandegoris</b></font>) would bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. Then sware King Clariance of Northumberland he (<font color='blue'><b>Clariance</b></font>) would bring three thousand men of arms.
<p/>Then sware the King of the Hundred Knights, that was a passing good man and a young, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would bring four thousand men of arms on horseback.
<p/>Then there swore King Lot, a passing good knight, and Sir Gawain's father, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would bring five thousand men of arms on horseback.
<p/>Also there swore King Urience, that was Sir Uwain's father, of the land of Gore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) would bring six thousand men of arms on horseback.
<p/>Also there swore King Idres of Cornwall, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Idres</b></font>) would bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King Cradelmas to bring five thousand men on horseback.
<p/>Also there swore King Agwisance of Ireland to bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King Nentres to bring five thousand men of arms on horseback.
<p/>So their whole host was of clean men of arms on horseback fifty thousand, and a-foot ten thousand of good men's bodies.
<p/>Then were they soon ready, and mounted upon horse and sent forth their fore-riders, for these eleven kings in their ways laid a siege unto the castle of Bedegraine; and so they departed and drew toward Arthur, and left few to abide at the siege, for the castle of Bedegraine was holden of King Arthur, and the men that were therein were Arthur's.
<p/>Also there swore King Carados to bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. CHAPTER XIII. Of a dream of the King with the Hundred Knights.
<p/>So by Merlin's advice there were sent fore-riders to skim the country, and they met with the fore-riders of the north, and made them to tell which way the host came, and then they told it to Arthur, and by King Ban and Bors' council they let burn and destroy all the country afore them, there they should ride.
<p/>The King with the Hundred Knights met a wonder dream two nights afore the battle, that there blew a great wind, and blew down their castles and their towns, and after that came a water and bare it all away.
<p/>Then by counsel of Merlin, when they wist which way the eleven kings would ride and lodge that night, at midnight they set upon them, as they were in their pavilions.
<p/>All that heard of the sweven said it was a token of great battle. But the scout-watch by their host cried, Lords! at arms!
<p/>for here be your enemies at your hand! CHAPTER XIV. How the eleven kings with their host fought against Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) host, and many great feats of the war.
<p/>THEN King Arthur and King Ban and King Bors, with their good and trusty knights, set on them so fiercely that they made them overthrow their pavilions on their heads, but the eleven kings, by manly prowess of arms, took a fair champaign, but there was slain that morrowtide ten thousand good men's bodies.
<p/>And so they had afore them a strong passage, yet were they fifty thousand of hardy men. Then it drew toward day.
<p/>I would that King Ban and King Bors, with their fellowship of ten thousand men, were put in a wood here beside, in an ambushment, and keep them privy, and that they be laid or the light of the day come, and that they stir not till ye and your knights have fought with them long.
<p/>And when it is daylight, dress your battle even afore them and the passage, that they may see all your host, for then will they be the more hardy, when they see you but about twenty thousand men, and cause them to be the gladder to suffer you and your host to come over the passage.
<p/>All the three kings and the whole barons said that Merlin said passingly well, and it was done anon as Merlin had devised.
<p/>Now shall ye do by mine advice, said Merlin unto the three kings: So on the morn, when either host saw other, the host of the north was well comforted.
<p/>Then to Ulfius and Brastias were delivered three thousand men of arms, and they set on them fiercely in the passage, and slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it was wonder to tell.
<p/>When that the eleven kings saw that there was so few a fellowship did such deeds of arms, they were ashamed and set on them again fiercely; and there was Sir Ulfius's horse slain under him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulfius</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulfius</b></font>) did marvellously well on foot.
<p/>Then Brastias saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulfius</b></font>) fellow fared so withal he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulfius</b></font>) smote the duke with a spear, that horse and man fell down.
<p/>That saw King Clariance and returned unto Brastias, and either smote other so that horse and man went to the earth, and so they lay long astonied, and their horses' knees brast to the hard bone.
<p/>But the Duke Eustace of Cambenet and King Clariance of Northumberland, were alway grievous on Ulfius. Then came Sir Kay the seneschal with six fellows with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and did passing well.
<p/>With that came the eleven kings, and there was Griflet put to the earth, horse and man, and Lucas the butler, horse and man, by King Brandegoris, and King Idres, and King Agwisance.
<p/>When Sir Kay saw Griflet on foot, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rode on King Nentres and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) down, and led his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horse unto Sir Griflet, and horsed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) again.
<p/>Then waxed the medley passing hard on both parties. Also Sir Kay with the same spear smote down King Lot, and hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) passing sore.
<p/>That saw the King with the Hundred Knights, and ran unto Sir Kay and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) down, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) King Lot, whereof he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) said gramercy.
<p/>When Sir Griflet saw Sir Kay and Lucas the butler on foot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) took a sharp spear, great and square, and rode to Pinel, a good man of arms, and smote horse and man down, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unto Sir Kay.
<p/>Then King Lot saw King Nentres on foot, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ran unto Melot de la Roche, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) down, horse and man, and gave King Nentres the horse, and horsed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) again.
<p/>Also the King of the Hundred Knights saw King Idres on foot; then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ran unto Gwiniart de Bloi, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) down, horse and man, and gave King Idres the horse, and horsed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) again; and King Lot smote down Clariance de la Forest Savage, and gave the horse unto Duke Eustace.
<p/>And so when they had horsed the kings again they drew them, all eleven kings, together, and said they would be revenged of the damage that they had taken that day.
<p/>The meanwhile came in Sir Ector with an eager countenance, and found Ulfius and Brastias on foot, in great peril of death, that were foul defoiled under horse-feet.
<p/>Then Arthur as a lion, ran unto King Cradelment of North Wales, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) through the left side, that the horse and the king fell down; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) took the horse by the rein, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) unto Ulfius, and said, Have this horse, mine old friend, for great need hast thou of horse.
<p/>When the King with the Hundred Knights saw King Cradelment on foot, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ran unto Sir Ector, that was well horsed, Sir Kay's father, and smote horse and man down, and gave the horse unto the king, and horsed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) again.
<p/>And when King Arthur saw the king ride on Sir Ector's horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was wroth and with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sword he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) smote the king on the helm, that a quarter of the helm and shield fell down, and so the sword carved down unto the horse's neck, and so the king and the horse fell down to the ground.
<p/>Then Sir Kay came unto Sir Morganore, seneschal with the King of the Hundred Knights, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) down, horse and man, and led the horse unto his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) father, Sir Ector; then Sir Ector ran unto a knight, hight Lardans, and smote horse and man down, and led the horse unto Sir Brastias, that great need had of an horse, and was greatly defoiled.
<p/>When Brastias beheld Lucas the butler, that lay like a dead man under the horses' feet, and ever Sir Griflet did marvellously for to rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and there were always fourteen knights on Sir Lucas; then Brastias smote one of them on the helm, that it went to the teeth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) rode to another and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>), that the arm flew into the field.
<p/>Gramercy, said Ulfius. Then Sir Arthur did so marvellously in arms, that all men had wonder. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went to the third and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) on the shoulder, that shoulder and arm flew in the field.
<p/>And when Griflet saw rescues, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) smote a knight on the temples, that head and helm went to the earth, and Griflet took the horse of that knight, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) unto Sir Lucas, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) mount upon the horse and revenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) hurts.
<p/>THEN Lucas saw King Agwisance, that late had slain Moris de la Roche, and Lucas ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) with a short spear that was great, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) such a fall, that the horse fell down to the earth.
<p/>Also Lucas found there on foot, Bloias de La Flandres, and Sir Gwinas, two hardy knights, and in that woodness that Lucas was in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) slew two bachelors and horsed them again.
<p/>Then waxed the battle passing hard on both parties, but Arthur was glad that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights were horsed again, and then they fought together, that the noise and sound rang by the water and the wood.
<p/>Wherefore King Ban and King Bors made them ready, and dressed their shields and harness, and they were so courageous that many knights shook and bevered for eagerness.
<p/>All this while Lucas, and Gwinas, and Briant, and Bellias of Flanders, held strong medley against six kings, that was King Lot, King Nentres, King Brandegoris, King Idres, King Uriens, and King Agwisance.
<p/>So with the help of Sir Kay and of Sir Griflet they held these six kings hard, that unnethe they had any power to defend them.
<p/>But when Sir Arthur saw the battle would not be ended by no manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fared wood as a lion, and steered his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse here and there, on the right hand, and on the left hand, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stinted not till he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had slain twenty knights.
<p/>Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wounded King Lot sore on the shoulder, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to leave that ground, for Sir Kay and Griflet did with King Arthur there great deeds of arms.
<p/>Then Ulfius, and Brastias, and Sir Ector encountered against the Duke Eustace, and King Cradelment, and King Clariance of Northumberland, and King Carados, and against the King with the Hundred Knights.
<p/>For Brastias had slain a knight to-fore and horsed Griflet. CHAPTER XV. Yet of the same battle. So these knights encountered with these kings, that they made them to avoid the ground.
<p/>Then King Lot made great dole for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) damages and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fellows, and said unto the ten kings, But if ye will do as I devise we shall be slain and destroyed; let me have the King with the Hundred Knights, and King Agwisance, and King Idres, and the Duke of Cambenet, and we five kings will have fifteen thousand men of arms with us, and we will go apart while ye six kings hold medley with twelve thousand; an we see that ye have foughten with them long, then will we come on fiercely, and else shall we never match them, said King Lot, but by this mean.
<p/>So they departed as they here devised, and six kings made their party strong against Arthur, and made great war long.
<p/>In the meanwhile brake the ambushment of King Ban and King Bors, and Lionses and Phariance had the vanguard, and they two knights met with King Idres and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fellowship, and there began a great medley of breaking of spears, and smiting of swords, with slaying of men and horses, and King Idres was near at discomforture.
<p/>That saw Agwisance the king, and put Lionses and Phariance in point of death; for the Duke of Cambenet came on withal with a great fellowship.
<p/>So these two knights were in great danger of their lives that they were fain to return, but always they rescued themselves and their fellowship marvellously
<p/>When King Bors saw those knights put aback, it grieved him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sore; then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came on so fast that his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fellowship seemed as black as Inde.
<p/>When King Lot had espied King Bors, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) well, then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said, O Jesu, defend us from death and horrible maims!
<p/>; for I see yonder a king, one of the most worshipfullest men and one of the best knights of the world, is inclined unto his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fellowship.
<p/>for I see well we be in great peril of death What is he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)? said the King with the Hundred Knights.
<p/>It is, said King Lot, King Bors of Gaul; I marvel how they came into this country without witting of us all.
<p/>It was by Merlin's advice, said the knight. As for him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), said King Carados, I will encounter with King Bors, an ye will rescue me when myster is.
<p/>Then King Carados and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) host rode on a soft pace, till that they came as nigh King Bors as bow-draught; then either battle let their horse run as fast as they might.
<p/>Go on, said they all, we will do all that we may. And Bleoberis, that was godson unto King Bors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) bare his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) chief standard
<p/>Now shall we see, said King Bors, how these northern Britons can bear the arms: and King Bors encountered with a knight, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) throughout with a spear that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fell dead unto the earth; and after drew his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sword and did marvellous deeds of arms, that all parties had great wonder thereof; and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knights failed not, but did their part, and King Carados was smitten to the earth.
<p/>With that came the King with the Hundred Knights and rescued King Carados mightily by force of arms, for he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was a passing good knight of a king, and but a young man.
<p/>, that was a passing good knight. CHAPTER XVI. Yet more of the same battle. BY then came into the field King Ban as fierce as a lion, with bands of green and thereupon gold.
<p/>a! said King Lot, we must be discomfited, for yonder I see the most valiant knight of the world, and the man of the most renown, for such two brethren as is King Ban and King Bors are not living, wherefore we must needs void or die; and but if we avoid manly and wisely there is but death.
<p/>When King Ban came into the battle, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came in so fiercely that the strokes redounded again from the wood and the water; wherefore King Lot wept for pity and dole that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) saw so many good knights take their end.
<p/>But through the great force of King Ban they made both the northern battles that were departed hurtled together for great dread; and the three kings and their knights slew on ever, that it was pity on to behold that multitude of the people that fled.
<p/>But King Lot, and King of the Hundred Knights, and King Morganore gathered the people together passing knightly, and did great prowess of arms, and held the battle all that day, like hard.
<p/>When the King of the Hundred Knights beheld the great damage that King Ban did, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) thrust unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horse, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) on high upon the helm, a great stroke, and astonied him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sore.
<p/>Then King Ban was wroth with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ban</b></font>), and followed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ban</b></font>) fiercely; the other saw that, and cast up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ban</b></font>) shield, and spurred his (<font color='blue'><b>Ban</b></font>) horse forward, but the stroke of King Ban fell down and carved a cantel off the shield, and the sword slid down by the hauberk behind his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) back, and cut through the trapping of steel and the horse even in two pieces, that the sword felt the earth.
<p/>Then the King of the Hundred Knights voided the horse lightly, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sword he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) broached the horse of King Ban through and through.
<p/>With that King Ban voided lightly from the dead horse, and then King Ban smote at the other so eagerly, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) on the helm that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fell to the earth.
<p/>By then came into the press King Arthur, and found King Ban standing among dead men and dead horses, fighting on foot as a wood lion, that there came none nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) might reach with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sword, but he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) caught a grievous buffet; whereof King Arthur had great pity.
<p/>And Arthur was so bloody, that by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) shield there might no man know him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), for all was blood and brains on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sword.
<p/>And as Arthur looked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw a knight that was passingly well horsed, and therewith Sir Arthur ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) on the helm, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword went unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) teeth, and the knight sank down to the earth dead, and anon Arthur took the horse by the rein, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) unto King Ban, and said, Fair brother, have this horse, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Ban</b></font>) have great myster thereof, and me repenteth sore of your great damage.
<p/>It shall be soon revenged, said King Ban, for I trust in God mine ure is not such but some of them may sore repent this.
<p/>Ha! Also in that ire he (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) felled King Morganore, and there was great slaughter of good knights and much people. I will well, said Arthur, for I see your deeds full actual
<p/>But when King Ban was mounted on horseback, then there began new battle, the which was sore and hard, and passing great slaughter.
<p/>; nevertheless, I might not come at you at that time. And so through great force King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors made their knights a little to withdraw them.
<p/>But alway the eleven kings with their chivalry never turned back; and so withdrew them to a little wood, and so over a little river, and there they rested them, for on the night they might have no rest on the field.
<p/>And then the eleven kings and knights put them on a heap all together, as men adread and out of all comfort.
<p/>no man might pass them, they held them so hard together both behind and before, that King Arthur had marvel of their deeds of arms, and was passing wroth.
<p/>Ah, Sir Arthur, said King Ban and King Bors, blame them not, for they do as good men ought to do.
<p/>For by my faith, said King Ban, they are the best fighting men, and knights of most prowess, that ever I saw or heard speak of, and those eleven kings are men of great worship; and if they were longing unto you there were no king under the heaven had such eleven knights, and of such worship.
<p/>we well, said King Ban and King Bors, for they are your mortal enemies, and that hath been proved aforehand; and this day they have done their part, and that is great pity of their wilfulness.
<p/>Then all the eleven kings drew them together, and then said King Lot, Lords, ye must other ways than ye do, or else the great loss is behind
<p/>; ye may see what people we have lost, and what good men we lose, because we wait always on these foot-men, and ever in saving of one of the foot-men we lose ten horsemen for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lot</b></font>); therefore this is mine advice, let us put our foot-men from us, for it is near night, for the noble Arthur will not tarry on the footmen, for they may save themselves, the wood is near hand.
<p/>And when we horsemen be together, look every each of you kings let make such ordinance that none break upon pain of death.
<p/>And who that seeth any man dress him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to flee, lightly that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be slain, for it is better that we slay a coward, than through a coward all we to be slain.
<p/>But there was I may not love them, said Arthur, they would destroy me. That wot How say ye? said King Lot, answer me all ye kings.
<p/>It is well said, quoth King Nentres; so said the King of the Hundred Knights; the same said the King Carados, and King Uriens; so did King Idres and King Brandegoris; and so did King Cradelment, and the Duke of Cambenet
<p/>; the same said King Clariance and King Agwisance, and sware they would never fail other, neither for life nor for death.
<p/>Then they amended their harness, and righted their shields, and took new spears and set them on their thighs, and stood still as it had been a plump of wood.
<p/>And whoso that fled, but did as they did, should be slain. CHAPTER XVII. Yet more of the same battle, and how it was ended by Merlin.
<p/>WHEN Sir Arthur and King Ban and Bors beheld them and all their knights, they praised them much for their noble cheer of chivalry, for the hardiest fighters that ever they heard or saw.
<p/>With that, there dressed them a forty noble knights, and said unto the three kings, they would break their battle; these were their names: Lionses, Phariance, Ulfius, Brastias, Ector, Kay, Lucas the butler, Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Mariet de la Roche, Guinas de Bloi, Briant de la Forest Savage, Bellaus, Morians of the Castle -LSB-of-RSB- Maidens, Flannedrius of the Castle of Ladies, Annecians that was King Bors' godson, a noble knight, Ladinas de la Rouse, Emerause, Caulas, Graciens le Castlein, one Blois de la Case, and Sir Colgrevaunce de Gorre; all these knights rode on afore with spears on their thighs, and spurred their horses mightily as the horses might run.
<p/>And the eleven kings with part of their knights rushed with their horses as fast as they might with their spears, and there they did on both parties marvellous deeds of arms.
<p/>So came into the thick of the press, Arthur, Ban, and Bors, and slew down right on both hands, that their horses went in blood up to the fetlocks.
<p/>Wherefore Ban and Bors had great marvel, considering the great slaughter that there was, but at the last they were driven aback over a little river.
<p/>But ever the eleven kings and their host was ever in the visage of Arthur. With that came Merlin on a great black horse, and said unto Arthur, Thou hast never done!
<p/>Hast thou not done enough? of three score thousand this day hast thou left alive but fifteen thousand, and it is time to say Ho!
<p/>For God is wroth with thee, that thou wilt never have done; for yonder eleven kings at this time will not be overthrown, but an thou tarry on them any longer, thy fortune will turn and they shall increase.
<p/>And therefore withdraw you unto your lodging, and rest you as soon as ye may, and reward your good knights with gold and with silver, for they have well deserved it; there may no riches be too dear for them, for of so few men as ye have, there were never men
<p/>did more of prowess than they have done today, for ye have matched this day with the best fighters of the world.
<p/>That is truth, said King Ban and Bors. Also said Merlin, withdraw you where ye list, for this three year I dare undertake they shall not dere you; and by then ye shall hear new tidings.
<p/>And then Merlin said unto Arthur, These eleven kings have more on hand than they are ware of, for the Saracens are landed in their countries, more than forty thousand, that burn and slay, and have laid siege at the castle Wandesborow, and make great destruction; therefore dread you not this three year.
<p/>Also, sir, all the goods that be gotten at this battle, let it be searched, and when ye have it in your hands, let it be given freely unto these two kings, Ban and Bors, that they may reward their knights withal; and that shall cause strangers to be of better will to do you service at need.
<p/>Also you be able to reward your own knights of your own goods whensomever it liketh you. It is well said, quoth Arthur, and as thou hast devised, so shall it be done.
<p/>When it was delivered to Ban and Bors, they gave the goods as freely to their knights as freely as it was given to them.
<p/>Then Merlin took his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) leave of Arthur and of the two kings, for to go and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) master Bleise, that dwelt in Northumberland; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) departed and came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) master, that was passing glad of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) coming; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) told how Arthur and the two kings had sped at the great battle, and how it was ended, and told the names of every king and knight of worship that was there.
<p/>And so Bleise wrote the battle word by word, as Merlin told him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>), how it began, and by whom, and in likewise how it was ended, and who had the worse.
<p/>Merlin did his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) master Bleise do write; also he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) did do write all the battles that every worthy knight did of Arthur's court.
<p/>After this Merlin departed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) master and came to King Arthur, that was in the castle of Bedegraine, that was one of the castles that stand in the forest of Sherwood.
<p/>And Merlin was so disguised that King Arthur knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was all befurred in black sheep-skins, and a great pair of boots, and a bow and arrows, in a russet gown, and brought wild geese in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand, and it was on the morn after Candlemas day; but King Arthur knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) not.
<p/>All the battles that were done in Arthur's days Sir, said Merlin unto the king, will ye give me a gift?
<p/>Sir, said Merlin, ye were better to give me a gift that is not in your hand than to lose great riches, for here in the same place where the great battle was, is great treasure hid in the earth.
<p/>Wherefore, said King Arthur, should I give thee a gift, churl? Who told thee so, churl? said Arthur. Merlin told me so, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>Then Ulfius and Brastias knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) well enough, and smiled. Sir, said these two knights, it is Merlin that so speaketh unto you.
<p/>Then King Arthur was greatly abashed, and had marvel of Merlin, and so had King Ban and King Bors, and so they had great disport at him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>So in the meanwhile there came a damosel that was an earl's daughter: his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) name was Sanam, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) name was Lionors, a passing fair damosel; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) came thither for to do homage, as other lords did after the great battle.
<p/>And King Arthur set his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) love greatly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and so did she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and the king had ado with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and gat on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a child: his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) name was Borre, that was after a good knight, and of the Table Round.
<p/>Then there came word that the King Rience of North Wales made great war on King Leodegrance of Cameliard, for the which thing
<p/>So by ordinance of the three kings that were sent home unto Benwick, all they would depart for dread of King Claudas; and Phariance, and Antemes, and Gratian, and Lionses -LSB-of-RSB- Payarne, with the leaders of those that should keep the kings' lands.
<p/>Arthur was wroth, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) well, and hated King Rience, for he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was alway against him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). CHAPTER XVIII. How King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors rescued King Leodegrance, and other incidents.
<p/>AND then King Arthur, and King Ban, and King Bors departed with their fellowship, a twenty thousand, and came within six days into the country of Cameliard, and there rescued King Leodegrance, and slew there much people of King Rience, unto the number of ten thousand men, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to flight.
<p/>And then had these three kings great cheer of King Leodegrance, that thanked them of their great goodness, that they would revenge him (<font color='blue'><b>Leodegrance</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Leodegrance</b></font>) enemies; and there had Arthur the first sight of Guenever, the king's daughter of Cameliard, and ever after he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>So, briefly to make an end, they took their leave to go into their own countries, for King Claudas did great destruction on their lands.
<p/>Nay, said the kings, ye shall not at this time, for ye have much to do yet in these lands, therefore we will depart, and with the great goods that we have gotten in these lands by your gifts, we shall wage good knights and withstand the King Claudas' malice, for by the grace of God, an we have need
<p/>we will send to you for your succour; and if ye have need, send for us, and we will not tarry, by the faith of our bodies.
<p/>It shall not, said Merlin, need that these two kings come again in the way of war, but I know well King Arthur may not be long from you, for within a year or two ye shall have great need, and then shall he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) revenge you on your enemies, as ye have done on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>For these eleven kings shall die all in a day, by the great might and prowess of arms of two valiant knights -LRB-as it telleth after-RRB-; their names be Balin le Savage, and Balan, his (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) brother, that be marvellous good knights as be any living.
<p/>Now turn we to the eleven kings that returned unto a city that hight Sorhaute, the which city was within King Uriens', and there they refreshed them as well as they might, and made leeches search their wounds, and sorrowed greatly for the death of their people.
<p/>With that there came a messenger and told how there was come into their lands people that were lawless as well as Saracens, a forty thousand, and have burnt and slain all the people that they may come by, without mercy, and have laid siege on the castle of Wandesborow.
<p/>Alas, said the eleven kings, here is sorrow upon sorrow, and if we had not warred against Arthur as we have done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would soon revenge us.
<p/>As for King Leodegrance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leodegrance</b></font>) loveth Arthur better than us, and as for King Rience, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hath enough to do with Leodegrance, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Leodegrance</b></font>) hath laid siege unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Leodegrance</b></font>).
<p/>After they were wedded, as it telleth in the book. Then said Arthur, I will go with you. So they consented together to keep all the marches of Cornwall, of Wales, and of the North.
<p/>So first, they put King Idres in the City of Nauntes in Britain, with four thousand men of arms, to watch both the water and the land.
<p/>Also they put in the city of Windesan, King Nentres of Garlot, with four thousand knights to watch both on water and on land.
<p/>Also they had of other men of war more than eight thousand, for to fortify all the fortresses in the marches of Cornwall.
<p/>Also they put more knights in all the marches of Wales and Scotland, with many good men of arms, and so they kept them together the space of three year, and ever allied them with mighty kings and dukes and lords.
<p/>And all this while they furnished them and garnished them of good men of arms, and victual, and of all manner of habiliment that pretendeth to the war, to avenge them for the battle of Bedegraine, as it telleth in the book of adventures following.
<p/>And to them fell King Rience of North Wales, the which and Nero that was a mighty man of men. CHAPTER XIX.
<p/>How King Arthur rode to Carlion, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dream, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw the questing beast. THEN after the departing of King Ban and of King Bors, King Arthur rode into Carlion.
<p/>And thither came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), King Lot's wife, of Orkney, in manner of a message, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was sent thither to espy the court of King Arthur; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came richly beseen, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) four sons, Gawaine, Gaheris, Agravine, and Gareth, with many other knights and ladies.
<p/>For she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a passing fair lady, therefore the king cast great love unto her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and desired to lie by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); so they were agreed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) begat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Mordred, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sister, on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mother's side, Igraine.
<p/>So there she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a month, and at the last departed. Then the king dreamed a marvellous dream whereof he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was sore adread.
<p/>Thus was the dream of Arthur: Him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thought there was come into this land griffins and serpents, and him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thought they burnt and slew all the people in the land, and then him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fought with them, and they did him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) passing great harm, and wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) full sore, but at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) slew them.
<p/>When the king awaked, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was passing heavy of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) dream, and so to put it out of thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ready with many knights to ride a-hunting.
<p/>But all this time King Arthur knew not that King Lot's wife was his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sister. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was in the forest the king saw a great hart afore him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>This hart will I chase, said King Arthur, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spurred the horse, and rode after long, and so by fine force oft
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was like to have smitten the hart; whereas the king had chased the hart so long, that his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse lost his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) breath, and fell down dead.
<p/>So the king saw the hart enbushed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) down by a fountain, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fell in great thoughts.
<p/>Then a yeoman fetched the king another horse. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sat so, him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heard a noise of hounds, to the sum of thirty.
<p/>And with that the king saw coming toward him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the strangest beast that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) saw or heard of; so the beast went to the well and drank, and the noise was in the beast's belly like unto the questing of thirty couple hounds; but all the while the beast drank there was no noise in the beast's belly: and there with the beast departed with a great noise, whereof the king had great marvel.
<p/>so there came a knight afoot unto Arthur and said, Knight full of thought and sleepy, tell me if thou sawest a strange beast pass this way.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was in a great thought, and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fell asleep. Right Such one saw I, said King Arthur, that is past two mile; what would ye with the beast? said Arthur.
<p/>Sir, I have followed that beast long time, and killed mine horse, so would God I had another to follow my quest.
<p/>Right so came one with the king's horse, and when the knight saw the horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) prayed the king to give him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the horse: for I have followed this quest this twelvemonth, and either I shall achieve him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), or bleed of the best blood of my body.
<p/>Pellinore, that time king, followed the Questing Beast, and after his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) death Sir Palamides followed it. CHAPTER XX. How King Pellinore took Arthur's horse and followed the Questing Beast, and how Merlin met with Arthur.
<p/>SIR knight, said the king, leave that quest, and suffer me to have it, and I will follow it another twelvemonth.
<p/>Ah, fool, said the knight unto Arthur, it is in vain thy desire, for it shall never be achieved but by me, or my next kin.
<p/>Therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) started unto the king's horse and mounted into the saddle, and said, Gramercy, this horse is my own. Well, said the king, thou mayst take my horse by force, but an
<p/>I might prove thee whether thou were better on horseback or I.--Well, said the knight, seek me here when thou wilt, and here nigh this well thou shalt find me, and so passed on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) way.
<p/>Right so came by him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) Merlin like a child of fourteen year of age, and saluted the king, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was so pensive.
<p/>Then the king sat in a study, and bade his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) men fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse as fast as ever they might. I may well be pensive, said the king, for I have seen the marvellest sight that ever I saw.
<p/>That know I well, said Merlin, as well as thyself, and of all thy thoughts, but thou art but a fool to take thought, for it will not amend thee.
<p/>Also I know what thou art, and who was thy father, and of whom thou wert begotten; King Uther Pendragon was thy father, and begat thee on Igraine.
<p/>That is false, said King Arthur, how shouldest thou know it, for thou art not so old of years to know my father?
<p/>Yes, said Merlin, I know it better than ye or any man living. I will not believe thee, said Arthur, and was wroth with the child.
<p/>So departed Merlin, and came again in the likeness of an old man of fourscore year of age, whereof the king was right glad, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) seemed to be right wise.
<p/>Also here was a child, and told me many things that meseemeth he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) should not know, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was not of age to know my father.
<p/>Yes, said the old man, the child told you truth, and more would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have told you an ye would have suffered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But ye have done a thing late that God is displeased with you, for ye have lain by your sister, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ye have gotten a child that shall destroy you and all the knights of your realm.
<p/>Then said the old man, Why are ye so sad? I may well be heavy, said Arthur, for many things. What are ye, said Arthur, that tell me these tidings?
<p/>Ah, said King Arthur, ye are a marvellous man, but I marvel much of thy words that I must die in battle.
<p/>Marvel not, said Merlin, for it is God's will your body to be punished for your foul deeds; but I may well be sorry, said Merlin, for I shall die a shameful death, to be put in the earth quick, and ye shall die a worshipful death.
<p/>And as they talked this, came one with the king's horse, and so the king mounted on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse, and Merlin on another, and so rode unto Carlion.
<p/>And anon the king asked Ector and Ulfius how he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was begotten, and they told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Uther Pendragon was his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) father and Queen Igraine his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said to Merlin, I will that my mother be sent for that I may speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) say so herself then will I believe it.
<p/>I am Merlin, and I was he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) in the child's likeness. In all haste, the queen was sent for, and she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) came and brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) Morgan le Fay, her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) daughter,
<p/>that was as fair a lady as any might be, and the king welcomed Igraine in the best manner. CHAPTER XXI.
<p/>How Ulfius impeached Queen Igraine, Arthur's mother, of treason; and how a knight came and desired to have the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) master revenged.
<p/>SO came Ulfius, and said openly, that the king and all might hear that were feasted that day, Ye are the falsest lady of the world, and the most traitress unto the king's person.
<p/>I am well ware, said Ulfius, what I speak, and here is my glove to prove it upon any man that will say the contrary, that this Queen Igraine is causer of your great damage, and of your great war.
<p/>For, an she (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) would have uttered it in the life of King Uther Pendragon, of the birth of you, and how ye were begotten ye had never had the mortal wars that ye have had; for the most part of your barons of your realm knew never whose son ye were, nor of whom ye were begotten; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) that bare you of her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) body should have made it known openly in excusing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) worship and yours, and in like wise to all the realm, wherefore I prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>) false to God and to you and to all your realm, and who will say the contrary I will prove it on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) body.
<p/>RIGHT Beware, said Arthur, what thou sayest; thou speakest a great word. Then spake Igraine and said, I am a woman
<p/>More, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, Merlin knoweth well, and ye Sir Ulfius, how King Uther came to me in the Castle of Tintagil in the likeness of my lord, that was dead three hours to-fore, and thereby gat a child that night upon me.
<p/>And after the thirteenth day King Uther wedded me, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) commandment when the child was born it was delivered unto Merlin and nourished by him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>),
<p/>and I may not fight, but rather than I should be dishonoured, there would some good man take my quarrel. and so I saw the child never after, nor wot not what is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name
<p/>, for I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never yet. And there, Ulfius said to the queen, Merlin is more to blame than ye.
<p/>, said the queen, I bare a child by my lord King Uther, but I wot not where he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is become.
<p/>Well I wot Then Merlin took the king by the hand, saying, This is your mother. And therewith Sir Ector bare witness how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) nourished him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) by Uther's commandment.
<p/>And therewith King Arthur took his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mother, Queen Igraine, in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Igraine</b></font>), and either wept upon other. And then the king let make a feast that lasted eight days.
<p/>Then on a day there came in the court a squire on horseback, leading a knight before him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wounded to the death, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) how there was a knight in the forest had reared up a pavilion by a well, and hath slain my master, a good knight, his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name was Miles; wherefore I beseech you that my master may be buried, and that some knight may revenge my master's death.
<p/>Then came Griflet that was but a squire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was but young, of the age of the king Arthur, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) besought the king for all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) service that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had done him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to give the order of knighthood.
<p/>How Griflet was made knight, and jousted with a knight THOU art full young and tender of age, said Arthur, for to take so high an order on thee.
<p/>Then the noise was great of that knight's death in the court, and every man said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advice. CHAPTER XXII. Sir, said Griflet, I beseech you make me knight.
<p/>Sir, said Merlin, it were great pity to lose Griflet, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) will be a passing good man when he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) is of age, abiding with you the term of his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) life.
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) adventure his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) body with yonder knight at the fountain, it is in great peril if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) come again, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is one of the best knights of the world, and the strongest man of arms.
<p/>Well, said Arthur. So at the desire of Griflet the king made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knight. Now, said Arthur unto Sir Griflet, sith
<p/>Thou shalt promise me by the faith of thy body, when thou hast jousted with the knight at the fountain, whether it fall ye be on foot or on horseback, that right
<p/>I have made you knight thou must give me a gift. What ye will, said Griflet. so ye shall come again unto me without making any more debate.
<p/>Then took Griflet his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse in great haste, and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield and took a spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode a great wallop till he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came to the fountain, and thereby he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw a rich pavilion, and thereby under a cloth stood a fair horse well saddled and bridled, and on a tree a shield of divers colours and a great spear.
<p/>I will promise you, said Griflet, as you desire. Then Griflet smote on the shield with the butt of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear, that the shield fell down to the ground.
<p/>With that the knight came out of the pavilion, and said, Fair knight, why smote ye down my shield? For I will joust with you, said Griflet.
<p/>ye do not, said the knight, for ye are but young, and late made knight, and your might is nothing to mine.
<p/>It is better As for that, said Griflet, I will joust with you. That is me loath, said the knight, but sith I must needs, I will dress me thereto.
<p/>So the two knights ran together that Griflet's spear all to-shivered; and there withal he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) smote Griflet through the shield and the left side, and brake the spear that the truncheon stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) body, that horse and knight fell down.
<p/>How twelve knights came from Rome and asked truage for this land of Arthur, and how Arthur fought with a knight.
<p/>WHEN the knight saw him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lie so on the ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) alighted, and was passing heavy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) weened he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had slain him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) helm and gat him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wind, and so with the truncheon he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse, and so betook him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to God, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had a mighty heart, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might live he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would prove a passing good knight.
<p/>Of whence be ye? said the knight. Sir, I am of Arthur's court. CHAPTER XXIII. And so Sir Griflet rode to the court, where great dole was made for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Right so came into the court twelve knights, and were aged men, and they came from the Emperor of Rome, and they asked of Arthur truage for this realm, other else the emperor would destroy him (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) land.
<p/>But through good leeches he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) was healed and saved. Well, said King Arthur, ye are messengers, therefore ye may say what ye will, other else ye should die therefore.
<p/>But this is mine answer: I owe the emperor no truage, nor none will I hold him (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>), but on a fair field I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) my truage that shall be with a sharp spear, or else with a sharp sword, and that shall not be long, by my father's soul, Uther Pendragon.
<p/>And therewith the messengers departed passingly wroth, and King Arthur as wroth, for in evil time came they then; for the king was passingly wroth for the hurt of Sir Griflet.
<p/>it be day his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) best horse and armour, with all that longeth unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) person, be without the city or to-morrow day.
<p/>Right so or to-morrow day he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) met with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) man and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse, and so mounted up and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shield and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) spear, and bade his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) chamberlain tarry there till he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came again.
<p/>And so Arthur rode a soft pace till it was day, and then was he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ware of three churls chasing Merlin, and would have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) commanded a privy man of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) chamber that or Then the king rode unto them, and bade them:
<p/>Flee, churls! then were they afeard when they saw a knight, and fled. O Merlin, said Arthur, here hadst thou been slain for all thy crafts
<p/>Nay, said Merlin, not so, for I could save myself an I would; and thou art more near thy death than I am, for thou goest to the deathward, an God be not thy friend.
<p/>had I not been. So as they went thus talking they came to the fountain, and the rich pavilion there by it.
<p/>Then King Arthur was ware where sat a knight armed in a chair. Sir knight, said Arthur, for what cause abidest thou here, that there may no knight ride this way
<p/>This custom, said the knight, have I used and will use maugre who saith nay, and who is grieved with my custom let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) amend it that will.
<p/>but if he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) joust with thee? said the king. I rede thee leave that custom, said Arthur. I will amend it, said Arthur.
<p/>Anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shield and took a spear, and they met so hard either in other's shields, that all to-shivered their spears.
<p/>I shall defend thee, said the knight. Therewith anon Arthur pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword. Nay, not so, said the knight ; it is fairer, said the knight, that we twain run more together with sharp spears.
<p/>so there came a squire and brought two good spears, and Arthur chose one and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) another; so they spurred their horses and came together with all their mights, that either brake their spears to their hands.
<p/>I will well, said Arthur, an I had any more spears. I have enow, said the knight; Then Arthur set hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword.
<p/>Nay, said the knight, ye shall do better, ye are a passing good jouster as ever I met withal, and once for the love of the high order of knighthood let us joust once again.
<p/>I assent me, said Arthur. Anon there were brought two great spears, and every knight gat a spear, and therewith they ran together that Arthur's spear all to-shivered.
<p/>But the other knight hit him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) so hard in midst of the shield, that horse and man fell to the earth, and therewith Arthur was eager, and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword, and said, I will assay thee, sir knight, on foot, for I have lost the honour on horseback.
<p/>I will be on horseback, said the knight. Then was Arthur wroth, and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shield toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword drawn.
<p/>When the knight saw that, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) alighted, for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) thought no worship to have a knight at such avail, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to be on horseback and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on foot, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) alighted and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield unto Arthur.
<p/>And there began a strong battle with many great strokes, and so hewed with their swords that the cantels flew in the fields, and much blood they bled both, that all the place there as they fought was overbled with blood, and thus they fought long and rested them, and then they went to the battle again, and so hurtled together like two rams that either fell to the earth.
<p/>So at the last they smote together that both their swords met even together. But the sword of the knight smote King Arthur's sword in two pieces, wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was heavy.
<p/>Then said the knight unto Arthur, Thou art in my daunger whether me list to save thee or slay thee, and but thou yield thee as overcome and recreant, thou shalt die.
<p/>As for death, said King Arthur, welcome be it when it cometh, but to yield me unto thee as recreant I had liefer die than to be so shamed.
<p/>And therewithal the king leapt unto Pellinore, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) by the middle and threw him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) down, and raced off his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) helm.
<p/>When the knight felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was adread, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was a passing big man of might, and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brought Arthur under him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and raced off his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) helm and would have smitten off his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) head.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIV. How Merlin saved Arthur's life, and threw an enchantment on King Pellinore and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to sleep. THEREWITHAL came Merlin and said, Knight, hold thy hand, for an thou slay that knight
<p/>thou puttest this realm in the greatest damage that ever was realm: for this knight is a man of more worship than thou wotest of.
<p/>Then would he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) for dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wrath, and heaved up his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword, and therewith Merlin cast an enchantment to the knight, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell to the earth in a great sleep.
<p/>Why, who is he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)? said the knight. It is King Arthur. Then Merlin took up King Arthur, and rode forth on the knight's horse.
<p/>not so worshipful a knight as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was; I had liefer than the stint of my land a year that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) were alive.
<p/>ye not, said Merlin, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) is wholer than ye; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) is but asleep, and will awake within three hours.
<p/>Alas! said Arthur, what hast thou done, Merlin? hast thou slain this good knight by thy crafts? There liveth Care I told you, said Merlin, what a knight he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was; here had ye been slain had I not been.
<p/>do you right good service; and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name is Pellinore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall have two sons that shall be passing good men; save one they shall have no fellow of prowess and of good living, and their names shall be Percivale of Wales and Lamerake of Wales, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percivale</b></font>) shall tell you the name of your own son, begotten of your sister, that shall be the destruction of all this realm.
<p/>Also there liveth not a bigger knight than he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall hereafter CHAPTER XXV. How Arthur by the mean of Merlin gat Excalibur his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword of the Lady of the Lake.
<p/>RIGHT SO the king and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) departed, and went unto an hermit that was a good man and a great leech.
<p/>So the hermit searched all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wounds and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good salves; so the king was there three days, and then were his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wounds well amended that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might ride and go, and so departed.
<p/>And as they rode, Arthur said, I have no sword. No force, said Merlin, hereby is a sword that shall be yours, an I may.
<p/>So they rode till they came to a lake, the which was a fair water and broad, and in the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in that hand.
<p/>Lo! said Merlin, yonder is that sword that I spake of. With that they saw a damosel going upon the lake.
<p/>That is the Lady of the Lake, said Merlin; and within that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on earth, and richly beseen; and this damosel will come to you anon, and then speak ye fair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will give you that sword.
<p/>What damosel is that? said Arthur. Anon withal came the damosel unto Arthur, and saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) again. Damosel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder the arm holdeth above the water?
<p/>Sir Arthur, king, said the damosel, that sword is mine, and if ye will give me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it.
<p/>I would it were mine, for I have no sword. By my faith, said Arthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask.
<p/>Well! said the damosel, go ye into yonder barge, and row yourself to the sword, and take it and the scabbard with you, and I will ask my gift when I see my time.
<p/>So Sir Arthur and Merlin alighted and tied their horses to two trees, and so they went into the ship, and when they came to the sword that the hand held, Sir Arthur took it up by the handles, and took it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and the arm and the hand went under the water.
<p/>And so -LSB-they-RSB- came unto the land and rode forth, and then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion. What signifieth yonder pavilion?
<p/>It is the knight's pavilion, said Merlin, that ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) is out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) is not there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) hath ado with a knight of yours that hight Egglame, and they have foughten together, but at the last Egglame fled, and else he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) had been dead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) hath chased him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) even to Carlion, and we shall meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) anon in the highway.
<p/>That is well said, said Arthur, now have I a sword, now will I wage battle with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and be avenged on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>Sir, you shall not so, said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>); also he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) will not be lightly matched of one knight living, and therefore it is my counsel, let him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) pass, for he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) shall do you good service in short time, and his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) sons after his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) days.
<p/>Also ye shall see that day in short space, you shall be right glad to give him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) your sister to we
<p/>d. When I see him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>), I will do as ye advise, said Arthur. Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well.
<p/>Whether liketh you better, said Merlin, the sword or the scabbard? Me liketh better the sword, said Arthur. Ye are more unwise, said Merlin, for the scabbard is worth ten of the swords, for whiles
<p/>ye have the scabbard upon you, ye shall never lose no blood, be ye never so sore wounded; therefore keep well the scabbard always with you.
<p/>So they rode unto Carlion, and by the way they met with Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had done such a craft, that Pellinore saw not Arthur, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) passed by without any words.
<p/>I marvel, said Arthur, that the knight would not speak. Sir, said Merlin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) saw you not, for an he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) had seen you, ye had not lightly departed.
<p/>So they came unto Carlion, whereof his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) knights were passing glad. And when they heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) adventures, they marvelled that he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) would jeopard his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) person so, alone.
<p/>But all men of worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain, that would put his (<font color='blue'><b>chieftain</b></font>) person in adventure as other poor knights did.
<p/>How tidings came to Arthur that King Rience had overcome eleven kings, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) desired Arthur's beard to trim his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mantle.
<p/>THIS meanwhile came a messenger from King Rience of North Wales, and king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was of all Ireland, and of many isles.
<p/>And this was his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) message, greeting well King Arthur in this manner wise, saying that King Rience had discomfited and overcome eleven kings, and everych of them did him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) homage, and that was this
<p/>, they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) their beards clean flayed off, as much as there was; wherefore the messenger came for King Arthur's beard.
<p/>For King Rience had purfled a mantle with kings' beards, and there lacked one place of the mantle; wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sent for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) beard, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would enter into his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lands, and burn and slay, and never leave till he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) have the head and the beard.
<p/>Well, said Arthur, thou hast said thy message, the which is the most villainous and lewdest message that ever man heard sent unto a king;
<p/>But tell thou thy king this: I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) none homage, nor none of mine elders; but or it be long to
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shall do me homage on both his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knees, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shall lose his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) head, by the faith of my body, for this
<p/>CHAPTER XXVI. also thou mayest see my beard is full young yet to make a purfle of it. is the most shamefulest message that ever I heard speak of.
<p/>I have espied thy king met never yet with worshipful man, but tell him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), I will have his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) head without he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) do me homage.
<p/>Then answered a knight that hight Naram, Sir, I know the king well; he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is a passing good man of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) body, as few be living, and a passing proud man, and Sir, doubt ye not he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will make war on you with a mighty puissance.
<p/>Then the messenger departed. Now is there any here, said Arthur, that knoweth King Rience? Well, said Arthur, I shall ordain for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in short time.
<p/>THEN King Arthur let send for all the children born on May-day, begotten of lords and born of ladies; for Merlin told King Arthur that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) that should destroy him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) should be born on May-day, wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sent for them all, upon pain of death; and so there were found many lords' sons, and all were sent unto the king, and so was Mordred sent by King Lot's wife, and all were put in a ship to the sea, and some were four weeks old, and some less.
<p/>And so by fortune the ship drave unto a castle, and was all to-riven, and destroyed the most part, save that Mordred was cast up, and a good man found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and nourished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was fourteen year old,
<p/>CHAPTER XXVII. How all the children were sent for that were born on May-day, and how Mordred was saved. and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the court, as it rehearseth afterward, toward the end of the Death of Arthur.
<p/>So many lords and barons of this realm were displeased, for their children were so lost, and many put the wite on Merlin more than on Arthur; so what for dread and for love, they held their peace.
<p/>But when the messenger came to King Rience, then was he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wood out of measure, and purveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) for a great host, as it rehearseth after in the book of Balin le Savage, that followeth next after, how by adventure Balin gat the sword.
<p/>Of a damosel which came girt with a sword for to find a man of such virtue to draw it out of the scabbard.
<p/>AFTER the death of Uther Pendragon reigned Arthur his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) son, the which had great war in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) days for to get all England into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Explicit liber primus. Incipit liber secundus BOOK II. CHAPTER I. For there were many kings within the realm of England, and in Wales, Scotland, and Cornwall.
<p/>So it befell on a time when King Arthur was at London, there came a knight and told the king tidings how that the King Rience of North Wales had reared a great number of people, and were entered into the land, and burnt and slew the king's true liege people.
<p/>If this be true, said Arthur, it were great shame unto mine estate but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were mightily withstood. It is truth, said the knight, for I saw the host myself.
<p/>Well, said the king, let make a cry, that all the lords, knights, and gentlemen of arms, should draw unto a castle called Camelot in those days, and there the king would let make a council-general and a great jousts.
<p/>So when the king was come thither with all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) baronage, and lodged as they seemed best, there was come a damosel the which was sent on message from the great lady Lile of Avelion.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) came before King Arthur, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) told from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) came, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) was sent on message unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) for these causes.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) mantle fall that was richly furred; and then was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) girt with a noble sword whereof the king had marvel, and said, Damosel, for what cause are ye girt with that sword?
<p/>this sword that I am girt withal doth me great sorrow and cumbrance, for I may not be delivered of this sword but by a knight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) must be a passing good man of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hands and of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) deeds, and without villainy or treachery, and without treason.
<p/>And if I may find such a knight that hath all these virtues, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) may draw out this sword out of the sheath, for I have been at King Rience's it
<p/>was told me there were passing good knights, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knights have assayed it and none can speed.
<p/>This is a great marvel, said Arthur, if this be sooth; I will myself assay to draw out the sword, not presuming upon myself that I am the best knight, but that I will begin to draw at your sword in giving example to all the barons that they shall assay everych one after other when I have assayed it.
<p/>Then Arthur took the sword by the sheath and by the girdle and pulled at it eagerly, but the sword would not out.
<p/>Sir, said the damosel, you need not to pull half so hard, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) that shall pull it out shall do it with little might.
<p/>Ye say well, said Arthur; now assay ye all my barons; but beware ye be not defiled with shame, treachery, nor guile.
<p/>Then it will not avail, said the damosel, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must be a clean knight without villainy, and of a gentle strain of father side and mother side.
<p/>Most of all the barons of the Round Table that were there at that time assayed all by row, but there might none speed; wherefore the damosel made great sorrow out of measure, and said, Alas!
<p/>it beseemeth you not. Now shall I tell you, said the damosel; I weened in this court had been the best knights without treachery or treason.
<p/>By my faith, said Arthur, here are good knights, as I deem, as any be in the world, but their grace is not to help you, wherefore I am displeased.
<p/>CHAPTER II. How Balin, arrayed like a poor knight, pulled out the sword, which afterward was the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) death.
<p/>, that had been prisoner with him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) half a year and more for slaying of a knight, the which was cousin unto King Arthur.
<p/>The name of this knight was called Balin, and by good means of the barons he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was delivered out of prison, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was a good man named of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) body, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was born in Northumberland.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) went privily into the court, and saw this adventure, whereof it raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) would assay it as other knights did, but for he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was poor and poorly arrayed he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) not far in press.
<p/>But in his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was fully assured to do as well, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) grace happed him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>), as any knight that there was.
<p/>And as the damosel took her (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) leave of Arthur and of all the barons, so departing, this knight Balin called unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>), and said, Damosel, I pray you of your courtesy, suffer me as well to assay as these lords; though that I be so poorly clothed, in my heart meseemeth I am fully assured as some of these others, and meseemeth in my heart to speed right well.
<p/>The damosel beheld the poor knight, and saw he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was a likely man, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) poor arrayment she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should be of no worship without villainy or treachery.
<p/>THEN fell it so that time there was a poor knight with King Arthur And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) said unto the knight,
<p/>Sir, it needeth not to put me to more pain or labour, for it seemeth not you to speed there as other have failed.
<p/>fair damosel, said Balin, worthiness, and good tatches, and good deeds, are not only in arrayment, but manhood and worship is hid within man's person, and many a worshipful knight is not known unto all people, and therefore worship and hardiness is not in arrayment.
<p/>Then Balin took the sword by the girdle and sheath, and drew it out easily; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) looked on the sword it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) much.
<p/>Then had the king and all the barons great marvel that Balin had done that adventure, and many knights had great despite of Balin.
<p/>Certes, said the damosel, this is a passing good knight, and the best that ever I found, and most of worship without treason, treachery, or villainy, and many marvels shall he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) do.
<p/>Ah! By God, said the damosel, ye say sooth; therefore ye shall assay to do what ye may. Now, gentle and courteous knight, give me the sword again.
<p/>Well, said the damosel, ye are not wise to keep the sword from me, for ye shall slay with the sword the best friend that ye have, and the man that ye most love in the world, and the sword shall be your destruction.
<p/>I shall take the adventure, said Balin, that God will ordain me, but the sword ye shall not have at this time, by the faith of my body.
<p/>Ye shall repent it within short time, said the damosel, for I would have the sword more for your avail than for mine, for I am passing heavy for your sake; for ye will not believe that sword shall be your destruction, and that is great pity.
<p/>Nay, said Balin, for this sword will I keep, but it be taken from me with force. With that the damosel departed, making great sorrow.
<p/>Anon after, Balin sent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) horse and armour, and so would depart from the court, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) leave of King Arthur.
<p/>Nay, said the king, I suppose ye will not depart so lightly from this fellowship, I suppose ye are displeased that I have shewed you unkindness; blame me the less, for I was misinformed against you, but I weened ye had not been such a knight as ye are, of worship and prowess, and if ye will abide in this court among my fellowship, I shall so advance you as ye shall be pleased.
<p/>God thank your highness, said Balin, your bounty and highness may no man praise half to the value; but at this time I must needs depart, beseeching you alway of your good grace.
<p/>Truly, said the king, I am right wroth for your departing; I pray you, fair knight, that ye tarry not long, and ye shall be right welcome to me, and to my barons, and I shall amend all miss that I have done against you; God thank your great lordship, said Balin, and therewith made him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) ready to depart.
<p/>Then the most part of the knights of the Round Table said that Balin did not this adventure all only by might, but by witchcraft.
<p/>CHAPTER III. How the Lady of the Lake demanded the knight's head that had won the sword, or the maiden's head.
<p/>THE meanwhile, that this knight was making him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ready to depart, there came into the court a lady that hight the Lady of the Lake.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) came on horseback, richly beseen, and saluted King Arthur, and there asked him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a gift that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) the sword.
<p/>That is sooth, said Arthur, a gift I promised you, but I have forgotten the name of my sword that ye gave me.
<p/>Ye say well, said the king; ask what ye will and ye shall have it, an it lie in my power to give it.
<p/>Well, said the lady, I ask the head of the knight that hath won the sword, or else the damosel's head that brought it
<p/>; I take no force though I have both their heads, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slew my brother, a good knight and a true, and that gentlewoman was causer of my father's death.
<p/>Truly, said King Arthur, I may not grant neither of their heads with my worship, therefore ask what ye will else, and I shall fulfil your desire.
<p/>The name of it, said the lady, is Excalibur, that is as much to say as Cut-steel. I will ask none other thing, said the lady.
<p/>When Balin was ready to depart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) saw the Lady of the Lake, that by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) means had slain Balin's mother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) had sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) three years; and when it was told him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) head of King Arthur, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) straight and said, Evil be you found; ye would have my head, and therefore ye shall lose yours, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) smote off her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) head before King Arthur.
<p/>ye have shamed me and all my court, for this was a lady that I was beholden to, and hither she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came under my safe-conduct
<p/>Sir, said Balin, me forthinketh of your displeasure, for this same lady was the untruest lady living, and by enchantment and sorcery she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hath been the destroyer of many good knights, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was causer that my mother was burnt, through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) falsehood and treachery.
<p/>What cause soever ye had, said Arthur, ye should have forborne her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in my presence; therefore, think not the contrary, ye shall repent it, for such another despite had I never in my court; therefore withdraw you out of my court in all haste
<p/>Then Balin took up the head of the lady, and bare it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) hostelry, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) met with his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) squire, that was sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) had displeased King Arthur
<p/>Alas, for shame! said Arthur, why have ye done so? ; I shall never forgive you that trespass. ye may. and so they rode forth out of the town.
<p/>Now, said Balin, we must depart, take thou this head and bear it to my friends, and tell them how I have sped, and tell my friends in Northumberland that my most foe is dead.
<p/>Also tell them how I am out of prison, and what adventure befell me at the getting of this sword. Alas! said the squire, ye are greatly to blame for to displease King Arthur.
<p/>As for that, said Balin, I will hie me, in all the haste that I may, to meet with King Rience and destroy him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), either else to die therefore; and if it may hap me to win him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), then will King Arthur be my good and gracious lord.
<p/>Where shall I meet with you? said the squire. In King Arthur's court, said Balin. So his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) squire and he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) departed at that time.
<p/>Then King Arthur and all the court made great dole and had shame of the death of the Lady of the Lake.
<p/>Then the king buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) richly. CHAPTER IV. How Merlin told the adventure of this damosel. AT that time there was a knight
<p/>, the which was the king's son of Ireland, and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) name was Lanceor, the which was an orgulous knight, and counted himself one of the best of the court; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had great despite at Balin for the achieving of the sword, that any should be accounted more hardy, or more of prowess; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) asked King Arthur if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) leave to ride after Balin and to revenge the despite that he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) had done.
<p/>Do your best, said Arthur, I am right wroth with Balin; I would he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were quit of the despite that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hath done to me and to my court.
<p/>In the meanwhile came Merlin unto the court of King Arthur, and there was told him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the adventure of the sword, and the death of the Lady of the Lake.
<p/>this same damosel that here standeth, that brought the sword unto your court, I shall tell you the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) coming: she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was the falsest damosel that liveth.
<p/>Then this Lanceor went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hostelry to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ready. Now shall I say you, said Merlin; Say not so, said they.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) hath a brother, a passing good knight of prowess and a full true man; and this damosel loved another knight that held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to paramour, and this good knight her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) brother met with the knight that held her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to paramour, and slew him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) by force of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hands.
<p/>When this false damosel understood this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) went to the Lady Lile of Avelion, and besought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) of help, to be avenged on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own brother.
<p/>AND so this Lady Lile of Avelion took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) this sword that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>), and told there should no man pull it out of the sheath but if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be one of the best knights of this realm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be hard and full of prowess, and with that sword he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should slay her (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) brother.
<p/>CHAPTER V. How Balin was pursued by Sir Lanceor, knight of Ireland, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) jousted and slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>). This was the cause that the damosel came into this court.
<p/>Would God she (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) had not come into this court, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lile</b></font>) came never in fellowship of worship to do good, but always great harm; and that knight that hath achieved the sword shall be destroyed by that sword, for the which will be great damage, for there liveth not a knight of more prowess than he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall do unto you, my Lord Arthur, great honour and kindness; and it is great pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shall not endure but a while, for of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) strength and hardiness
<p/>So the knight of Ireland armed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) at all points, and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shoulder, and mounted upon horseback, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand, and rode after a great pace, as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse might go; and within a little space on a mountain he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had a sight of Balin, and with a loud voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) cried, Abide, knight, for ye shall abide whether ye will or nill, and the shield that is to-fore you shall not help.
<p/>When Balin heard the noise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) horse fiercely, and said, Fair knight, what will ye with me, will ye joust with me?
<p/>I know it as well as ye. I know not his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) match living. Yea, said the Irish knight, therefore come I after you.
<p/>Peradventure, said Balin, it had been better to have holden you at home, for many a man weeneth to put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemy to a rebuke, and oft it falleth to himself.
<p/>I am come from the court of King Arthur, said the knight of Ireland, that come hither for to revenge the despite ye
<p/>Of what court be ye sent from? said Balin. did this day to King Arthur and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) court. Well, said Balin, I see
<p/>well I must have ado with you, that me forthinketh for to grieve King Arthur, or any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) court; and your quarrel is full simple, said Balin, unto me, for the lady that is dead, did me great damage, and else would I have been loath as any knight that liveth for to slay a lady.
<p/>Then they took their spears, and came together as much as their horses might drive, and the Irish knight smote Balin on the shield, that all went shivers off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear, and Balin hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) through the shield, and the hauberk perished, and so pierced through his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) body and the horse's croup, and anon turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) horse fiercely, and drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) sword, and wist not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) had slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>); and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) lie as a dead corpse.
<p/>Make you ready, said the knight Lanceor, and dress you unto me, for that one shall abide in the field. CHAPTER VI.
<p/>THEN he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) looked by him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and was ware of a damosel that came riding full fast as the horse might ride, on a fair palfrey.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) espied that Lanceor was slain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) made sorrow out of measure, and said, O Balin, two bodies thou hast slain and one heart, and two hearts in one body, and two souls thou hast lost.
<p/>How a damosel, which was love to Lanceor, slew herself for love, and how Balin met with his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother Balan. And therewith she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) took the sword from her (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) love that lay dead, and fell to the ground in a swoon.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) arose she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) made great dole out of measure, the which sorrow grieved Balin passingly sore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) went unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) for to have taken the sword out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) hand, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) held it so fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) might not take it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) hand unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) should have hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>), and suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) set the pommel to the ground, and rove herself through the body.
<p/>When Balin espied her (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) deeds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was passing heavy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) heart, and ashamed that so fair a damosel had destroyed herself for the love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) death.
<p/>Alas, said Balin, me repenteth sore the death of this knight, for the love of this damosel, for there was much true love betwixt them both, and for sorrow might not longer behold him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>), but turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) horse and looked toward a great forest, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was ware, by the arms, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother Balan.
<p/>Then Balan said, I little weened to have met with you at this sudden adventure; I am right glad of your deliverance out of your dolorous prisonment, for a man told me, in the castle of Four Stones, that ye were delivered, and that man had seen you in the court of King Arthur, and therefore I came hither into this country, for here I supposed to find you.
<p/>And when they were met they put off their helms and kissed together, and wept for joy and pity. Anon the knight
<p/>Balin told his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) adventure of the sword, and of the death of the Lady of the Lake, and how King Arthur was displeased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>Wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sent this knight after me, that lieth here dead, and the death of this damosel grieveth me sore. So doth it me, said Balan, but ye must take the adventure that God will ordain you.
<p/>Truly, said Balin, I am right heavy that my Lord Arthur is displeased with me, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is the most worshipful knight that reigneth now on earth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) love will I get or else
<p/>For the King Rience lieth at a siege at the Castle Terrabil, and thither will we draw in all haste, to prove our worship and prowess upon him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>will I put my life in adventure. I will well, said Balan, that we do, and we will help each other as brethren ought to do.
<p/>How a dwarf reproved Balin for the death of Lanceor, and how King Mark of Cornwall found them, and made a tomb over them.
<p/>The meanwhile as they talked, there came a dwarf from the city of Camelot on horseback, as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) might; and found the dead bodies, wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) made great dole, and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) hair for sorrow, and said, Which of you knights have done this deed?
<p/>CHAPTER VII. Now go we hence, said Balin, and well be we met. Whereby askest thou it? said Balan. For I would wit it, said the dwarf.
<p/>It was I, said Balin, that slew this knight in my defence, for hither he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) came to chase me, and either I must slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) or he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) me; and this damosel slew herself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) love, which repenteth me, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sake I shall owe all women the better love.
<p/>Alas, said the dwarf, thou hast done great damage unto thyself, for this knight that is here dead was one of the most valiantest men that lived, and trust well, Balin, the kin of this knight will chase you through the world till they have slain you.
<p/>As for that, said Balin, I fear not greatly, but I am right heavy that I have displeased my lord King Arthur, for the death of this knight.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw these two bodies dead, and understood how they were dead, by the two knights above said, then made the king great sorrow for the true love that was betwixt them, and said, I will not depart till I have on this earth made a tomb, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) pight his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) pavilions and sought through all the country to find a tomb, and in a church they found one was fair and rich, and then the king let put them both in the earth, and put the tomb upon them, and wrote the names of them both on the tomb.
<p/>How here lieth Lanceor the king's son of Ireland, that at his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own request was slain by the hands of Balin; and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) lady, Colombe, and paramour, slew herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) love's sword for dole and sorrow.
<p/>How Merlin prophesied that two the best knights of the world should fight there, which were Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram.
<p/>THE meanwhile as this was a-doing, in came Merlin to King Mark, and seeing all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) doing, said, Here shall be in this same place the greatest battle betwixt two knights that was or ever shall be, and the truest lovers, and yet none of them shall slay other.
<p/>And there Merlin wrote their names upon the tomb with letters of gold that should fight in that place, whose names were Launcelot de Lake, and Tristram.
<p/>Thou art a marvellous man, said King Mark unto Merlin, that speakest of such marvels, thou art a boistous man and an unlikely to tell of such deeds.
<p/>So as they talked together, there came a king of Cornwall riding, the which hight King Mark. CHAPTER VIII. What is thy name? said King Mark.
<p/>At this time, said Merlin, I will not tell, but at that time when Sir Tristram is taken with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sovereign lady, then ye shall hear and know my name, and at that time ye shall hear tidings that shall not please you.
<p/>Then said Merlin to Balin, Thou hast done thyself great hurt, because that thou savest not this lady that slew herself, that might have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) an thou wouldest.
<p/>Me repenteth, said Merlin; because of the death of that lady thou shalt strike a stroke most dolorous that ever man struck, except the stroke of our Lord, for thou shalt hurt the truest knight and the man of most worship that now liveth, and through that stroke three kingdoms shall be in great poverty, misery and wretchedness twelve years, and the knight shall not be whole of that wound for many years.
<p/>By the faith of my body, said Balin, I might not save her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slew herself suddenly. Then Merlin took his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) leave of Balin.
<p/>And Balin said, If I wist it were sooth that ye say I should do such a perilous deed as that
<p/>, I would slay myself to make thee a liar. Therewith Merlin vanished away suddenly. And then Balan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) brother took their leave of King Mark.
<p/>Sir, said Balan, ye may see he (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) beareth two swords, thereby ye may call him (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) the Knight with the Two Swords.
<p/>And so departed King Mark unto Camelot to King Arthur, and Balin took the way toward King Rience; and as they rode together they met with Merlin disguised, but they knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) not.
<p/>First, said the king, tell me your name. Whither ride you? said Merlin. We have little to do, said the two knights, to tell thee.
<p/>But what is thy name? said Balin. At this time, said Merlin, I will not tell it thee. It is evil seen, said the knights, that thou art a true man that thou wilt not tell thy name.
<p/>, I can tell you wherefore ye ride this way, for to meet King Rience; but it will not avail you without ye have my counsel.
<p/>As for that, said Merlin, be it as it be may Ah! said Balin, ye are Merlin ; we will be ruled by your counsel.
<p/>Come on, said Merlin, ye shall have great worship, and look that ye do knightly, for ye shall have great need.
<p/>As for that, said Balin, dread you not, we will do what we may. CHAPTER IX. How Balin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother, by the counsel of Merlin, took King Rience and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) to King Arthur.
<p/>THEN Merlin lodged them in a wood among leaves beside the highway, and took off the bridles of their horses and put them to grass and laid them down to rest them till it was nigh midnight.
<p/>Then Merlin bade them rise, and make them ready, for the king was nigh them, that was stolen away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) host with a three score horses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) best knights, and twenty of them rode to-fore to warn the Lady de Vance that the king was coming; for that night King Rience should have lain with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vance</b></font>).
<p/>Abide, said Merlin, here in a strait way ye shall meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>); and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) showed Balin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother where he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) rode.
<p/>Anon Balin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother met with the king, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) down, and wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) fiercely, and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) to the ground; and there they slew on the right hand and the left hand, and slew more than forty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) men, and the remnant fled.
<p/>Which is the king? said Balin. Then went they again to King Rience and would have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) not yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) unto their grace.
<p/>Then said he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) thus: Knights full of prowess, slay me not, for by my life ye may win, and by my death ye shall win nothing.
<p/>With that Merlin was vanished, and came to King Arthur aforehand, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) how his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) most enemy was taken and discomfited.
<p/>Then said these two knights, Ye say sooth and truth, and so laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) on a horse-litter. By whom? said King Arthur.
<p/>Anon after came the Knight with the Two Swords and Balan his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) brother, and brought with them King Rience of North Wales, and there delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to the porters, and charged them with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>); and so they two returned again in the dawning of the day.
<p/>By two knights, said Merlin, that would please your lordship, and to-morrow ye shall know what knights they are. King Arthur came then to King Rience, and said, Sir king, ye are welcome: by what adventure come ye hither?
<p/>Sir, said King Rience, I came hither by an hard adventure. Who won you? said King Arthur. Sir, said the king, the Knight with the Two Swords and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) brother, which are two marvellous knights of prowess.
<p/>Ah, said Merlin, I shall tell you: it is Balin that achieved the sword, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother Balan, a good knight, there liveth not a better of prowess and of worthiness, and it shall be the greatest dole of him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) that ever I knew of knight, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall not long endure.
<p/>Alas, said King Arthur, that is great pity; for I am much beholden unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and I have ill deserved it unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) kindness.
<p/>I know them not, said Arthur, but much I am beholden to them. Nay, said Merlin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) shall do much more for you, and that shall ye know in haste.
<p/>But, sir, are ye purveyed, said Merlin, for to-morn the host of Nero, King Rience's brother, will set on you or noon with a great host, and therefore make you ready, for I will depart from you.
<p/>How King Arthur had a battle against Nero and King Lot of Orkney, and how King Lot was deceived by Merlin, and how twelve kings were slain.
<p/>THEN King Arthur made ready his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) host in ten battles and Nero was ready in the field afore the Castle Terrabil with a great host, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had ten battles, with many more people than Arthur had.
<p/>Then Nero had the vanguard with the most part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) people, and Merlin came to King Lot of the Isle of Orkney, and held him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) with a tale of prophecy, till Nero and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) people were destroyed.
<p/>And there Sir Kay the seneschal did passingly well, that the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) life the worship went never from him (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>); and Sir Hervis de Revel did marvellous deeds with King Arthur, and King Arthur slew that day twenty knights and maimed forty.
<p/>At that time came in the Knight with the Two Swords and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) brother Balan, but they two did so marvellously that the king and all the knights marvelled of them, and all they that beheld them said they were sent from heaven as angels, or devils from hell; and King Arthur said himself they were the best knights that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) saw, for they gave such strokes that all men had wonder of them.
<p/>In the meanwhile came one to King Lot, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) tarried there Nero was destroyed and slain with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) people.
<p/>Alas, said King Lot, I am ashamed, for by my default there is many a worshipful man slain, for an we had been together there had been none host under the heaven that had been able for to have matched with us; this faiter with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prophecy hath mocked me.
<p/>All that did Merlin, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) knew well that an King Lot had been with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lot</b></font>) body there at the first battle, King Arthur had been slain, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) people destroyed; and well Merlin knew that one of the kings should be dead that day, and loath was Merlin that any of them both should be slain; but of the twain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) had liefer King Lot had been slain than King Arthur.
<p/>Now what is best to do? said King Lot of Orkney; whether is me better to treat with King Arthur or to fight, for the greater part of our people are slain and destroyed?
<p/>CHAPTER X. Sir, said a knight, set on Arthur for they are weary and forfoughten and we be fresh. As for me, said King Lot, I would every knight would do his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) part as I would do mine.
<p/>And then they advanced banners and smote together and all to-shivered their spears; and Arthur's knights, with the help of the Knight with the Two Swords and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) brother Balan put King Lot and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) host to the worse.
<p/>But always King Lot held him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) in the foremost front, and did marvellous deeds of arms, for all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) host was borne up by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hands, for he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) abode all knights.
<p/>Alas he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) might not endure, the which was great pity, that so worthy a knight as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was one should be overmatched, that of late time afore had been a knight of King Arthur's, and wedded the sister of King Arthur; and for King Arthur lay by King Lot's wife, the which was Arthur's sister, and gat on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) Mordred, therefore King Lot held against Arthur.
<p/>So there was a knight that was called the Knight with the Strange Beast, and at that time his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) right name was called Pellinore, the which was a good man of prowess, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) smote a mighty stroke at King Lot as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fought with all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) enemies, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) failed of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) stroke, and smote the horse's neck, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fell to the ground with King Lot.
<p/>And then all the host of Orkney fled for the death of King Lot, and there were slain many mothers' sons.
<p/>But King Pellinore bare the wite of the death of King Lot, wherefore Sir Gawaine revenged the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) father the tenth year after he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was made knight, and slew King Pellinore with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) own hands.
<p/>Also there were slain at that battle twelve kings on the side of King Lot with Nero, and all were buried in the Church of Saint Stephen's in Camelot, and the remnant of knights and of others were buried in a great rock.
<p/>And therewith anon Pellinore smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) a great stroke through the helm and head unto the brows. CHAPTER XI. Of the interment of twelve kings, and of the prophecy of Merlin, and how Balin should give the dolorous stroke.
<p/>SO at the interment came King Lot's wife Margawse with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) four sons, Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Gareth. Also there came thither King Uriens, Sir Ewaine's father, and Morgan le Fay his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wife that was King Arthur's sister.
<p/>But of all these twelve kings King Arthur let make the tomb of King Lot passing richly, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) tomb by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) own; and then Arthur let make twelve images of latten and copper, and over-gilt it with gold, in the sign of twelve kings, and each one of them held a taper of wax that burnt day and night; and King Arthur was made in sign of a figure standing above them with a sword drawn in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand, and all the twelve figures had countenance like unto men that were overcome.
<p/>All this made Merlin by his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) subtle craft, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) told the king, When I am dead these tapers shall burn no longer, and soon after the adventures of the Sangreal shall come among you and be achieved.
<p/>All these came to the interment. Also he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) told Arthur how Balin the worshipful knight shall give the dolorous stroke, whereof shall fall great vengeance.
<p/>As for Pellinore, said Merlin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) will meet with you soon; and as for Balin he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) will not be long from you; but the other brother will depart, ye shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) no more.
<p/>By my faith, said Arthur, they are two marvellous knights, and namely Balin passeth of prowess of any knight that ever I found, for much beholden am I unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>); would God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would abide with me.
<p/>Sir, said Merlin, look ye keep well the scabbard of Excalibur, for ye shall lose no blood while ye have the scabbard upon you, though ye have as many wounds upon you as ye may have.
<p/>So after, for great trust, Arthur betook the scabbard to Morgan le Fay his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sister, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loved another knight better than her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband King Uriens or King Arthur, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would have had Arthur her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother slain, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) let make another scabbard like it by enchantment, and gave the scabbard Excalibur to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) love; and the knight's name was called Accolon, that after had near slain King Arthur.
<p/>After this Merlin told unto King Arthur of the prophecy that there should be a great battle beside Salisbury, and Mordred his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) own son should be against him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>Oh, where is Balin and Balan and Pellinore? said King Arthur. Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) that Bagdemegus was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cousin, and germain unto King Uriens.
<p/>How a sorrowful knight came before Arthur, and how Balin fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and how that knight was slain by a knight invisible.
<p/>WITHIN a day or two King Arthur was somewhat sick, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) let pitch his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pavilion in a meadow, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) down on a pallet to sleep, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might have no rest.
<p/>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) heard a great noise of an horse, and therewith the king looked out at the porch of the pavilion, and saw a knight coming even by him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), making great dole.
<p/>CHAPTER XII. Right Abide, fair sir, said Arthur, and tell me wherefore thou makest this sorrow. Ye may little amend me, said the knight, and so passed forth to the castle of Meliot.
<p/>Anon after there came Balin, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) saw King Arthur he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) alighted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse, and came to the King on foot, and saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>Sir, right now came riding this way a knight making great mourn, for what cause I cannot tell; wherefore I would desire of you of your courtesy and of your gentleness to fetch again that knight either by force or else by his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) good will.
<p/>I will do more for your lordship than that, said Balin; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) rode more than a pace, and found the knight with a damosel in a forest, and said, Sir knight, ye must come with me unto King Arthur, for to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) of your sorrow.
<p/>By my head, said Arthur, ye be welcome. That will I not, said the knight, for it will scathe me greatly, and do you none avail.
<p/>Sir, said Balin, I pray you make you ready, for ye must go with me, or else I must fight with you and bring you by force, and that were me loath to do.
<p/>Will ye be my warrant, said the knight, an I go with you? Yea, said Balin, or else I will die therefore.
<p/>And as they were even afore King Arthur's pavilion, there came one invisible, and smote this knight that went with Balin throughout the body with a spear.
<p/>Alas, said the knight, I am slain under your conduct with a knight called Garlon; therefore take my horse that is better than yours, and ride to the damosel, and follow the quest that I was in as she (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) will lead you, and revenge my death when ye may.
<p/>That shall I do, said Balin, and that I make vow unto knighthood; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) departed from this knight with great sorrow.
<p/>So King Arthur let bury this knight richly, and made a mention on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) tomb, how there was slain Herlews le Berbeus, and by whom the treachery was done, the knight Garlon.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ready to go with Balin, and left the damosel still. But ever the damosel bare the truncheon of the spear with her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) that Sir Herlews was slain withal.
<p/>How Balin and the damosel met with a knight which was in likewise slain, and how the damosel bled for the custom of a castle.
<p/>So Balin and the damosel rode into a forest, and there met with a knight that had been a-hunting, and that knight asked Balin for what cause he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made so great sorrow.
<p/>CHAPTER XIII. Me list not to tell you, said Balin. Now, said the knight, an I were armed as ye be I would fight with you.
<p/>That should little need, said Balin, I am not afeard to tell you, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) all the cause how it was.
<p/>Ah, said the knight, is this all? here I ensure you by the faith of my body never to depart from you while my life lasteth.
<p/>And as they came by an hermitage even by a churchyard, there came the knight Garlon invisible, and smote this knight, Perin de Mountbeliard, through the body with a spear.
<p/>And so they went to the hostelry and armed them, and so rode forth with Balin. Alas, said the knight, I am slain by this traitor knight that rideth invisible.
<p/>Alas, said Balin, it is not the first despite he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) hath done me; and there the hermit and Balin buried the knight under a rich stone and a tomb royal.
<p/>And on the morn they found letters of gold written, how Sir Gawaine shall revenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) father's death, King Lot, on the King Pellinore.
<p/>Anon after this Balin and the damosel rode till they came to a castle, and there Balin alighted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) and the damosel went to go into the castle, and anon as Balin came within the castle's gate
<p/>the portcullis fell down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) back, and there fell many men about the damosel, and would have slain her (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>). When Balin saw that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was sore aggrieved, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) might not help the damosel.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) went up into the tower, and leapt over walls into the ditch, and hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) not; and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) sword and would have foughten with them.
<p/>And they all said nay, they would not fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>), for they did nothing but the old custom of the castle; and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) how their lady was sick, and had lain many years, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might not be whole
<p/>but if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a dish of silver full of blood of a clean maid and a king's daughter; and therefore the custom of this castle is, there shall
<p/>Well, said Balin, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shall bleed as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) may bleed, but I will not lose the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) whiles my life lasteth.
<p/>no damosel pass this way but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shall bleed of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) blood in a silver dish full. And so Balin made her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to bleed by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) good will, but her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) blood helped not the lady.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rested there all night, and had there right good cheer, and on the morn they passed on their ways.
<p/>And as it telleth after in the Sangreal, that Sir Percivale's sister helped that lady with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) blood, whereof she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was dead.
<p/>How Balin met with that knight named Garlon at a feast, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>), to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) blood to heal therewith the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) host.
<p/>THEN they rode three or four days and never met with adventure, and by hap they were lodged with a gentle man that was a rich man and well at ease.
<p/>CHAPTER XIV. And as they sat at their supper Balin overheard one complain grievously by him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) in a chair. What is this noise? said Balin.
<p/>I was but late at a jousting, and there I jousted with a knight that is brother unto King Pellam, and twice smote
<p/>Forsooth, said his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellam</b></font>) host, I will tell you. I him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellam</b></font>) down, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellam</b></font>) promised to quit me on my best friend;
<p/>and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellam</b></font>) wounded my son, that cannot be whole till I have of that knight's blood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rideth alway invisible; but I know not his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name.
<p/>, his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name is Garlon, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath slain two knights of mine in the same manner, therefore I had liefer meet with that knight than all the gold in this realm, for the despite he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath done me.
<p/>Well, said his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) host, I shall tell you, King Pellam of Listeneise hath made do cry in all this country a great feast that shall be within these twenty days, and no knight may come there but if he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bring his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wife with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), or his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) paramour; and that knight, your enemy and mine, ye shall see that day.
<p/>Ah! said Balin, I know that knight Then I behote you, said Balin, part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) blood to heal your son withal.
<p/>So on the morn they rode all three toward Pellam, and they had fifteen days' journey or they came thither; and that same day began the great feast.
<p/>And so they alighted and stabled their horses, and went into the castle; but Balin's host might not be let in because he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) had no lady.
<p/>Then Balin was well received and brought unto a chamber and unarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>); and there were brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) robes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) pleasure, and would have had Balin leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) sword behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>).
<p/>, said Balin, that do I not, for it is the custom of my country a knight always to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) weapon with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and that custom will I keep, or else I will depart as I came.
<p/>Then they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) leave to wear his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went unto the castle, and was set among knights of worship, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>We will be forward to-morn, said his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) host. Nay Soon Balin asked a knight, Is there not a knight in this court whose name is Garlon?
<p/>Yonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) goeth, said a knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) with the black face; he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is the marvellest knight that is now living, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) destroyeth many good knights, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) goeth invisible.
<p/>Then Balin advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) long: If I slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) here I shall not escape, and if I leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) now, peradventure
<p/>Ah well, said Balin, is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>)? I shall never meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) again at such a steven, and much harm he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) will do an he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) live.
<p/>Therewith this Garlon espied that this Balin beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) came and smote Balin on the face with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) hand, and said, Knight, why beholdest me so?
<p/>Thou sayest sooth, said Balin, this is not the first despite that thou hast done me, and therefore I will do what I came for, and rose up fiercely and clave his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) head to the shoulders.
<p/>for shame therefore, eat thy meat and do that thou came for. Give me the truncheon, said Balin to his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) lady, wherewith
<p/>And therewith Balin smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) through the body, and said openly, With that truncheon thou hast slain a good knight, and now it sticketh in thy body.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slew your knight. Anon she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave it him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), for alway she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bare the truncheon with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). And then Balin called unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) host, saying, Now may ye fetch blood enough to heal your son withal.
<p/>How Balin fought with King Pellam, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) sword brake, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) gat a spear wherewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) smote the dolorous stroke.
<p/>ANON all the knights arose from the table for to set on Balin, and King Pellam himself arose up fiercely, and said, Knight, hast thou slain my brother?
<p/>CHAPTER XV. thou shalt die therefore or thou depart. Well, said Balin, do it yourself. Yes, said King Pellam, there shall no man have ado with thee
<p/>Then King Pellam caught in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellam</b></font>) hand a grim weapon and smote eagerly at Balin; but Balin put the sword betwixt his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) head and the stroke, and therewith his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) sword burst in sunder.
<p/>And when Balin was weaponless he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) ran into a chamber for to seek some weapon, and so from chamber to chamber, and no weapon he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) could find, and always King Pellam after him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellam</b></font>).
<p/>And at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellam</b></font>) entered into a chamber that was marvellously well dight and richly, and a bed arrayed with cloth of gold, the richest that might be thought, and one lying therein, and thereby stood a table of clean gold with four pillars of silver that bare up the table, and upon the table stood a marvellous spear strangely wrought.
<p/>And when Balin saw that spear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) gat it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) hand and turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) to King Pellam, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) passingly sore with that spear, that King Pellam fell down in a swoon, and therewith the castle roof and walls brake and fell to the earth, and Balin fell down so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) might not stir foot nor hand.
<p/>And so the most part of the castle, that was fallen down through that dolorous stroke, lay upon Pellam and Balin three days.
<p/>but myself, for the love of my brother. CHAPTER XVI. How Balin was delivered by Merlin, and saved a knight that would have slain himself for love.
<p/>THEN Merlin came thither and took up Balin, and gat him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) a good horse, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was dead, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) ride out of that country.
<p/>And King Pellam lay so, many years sore wounded, and might never be whole till Galahad the haut prince healed him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellam</b></font>) in the quest of the Sangreal, for in that place was part of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that Joseph of Arimathea brought into this land, and there himself lay in that rich bed.
<p/>And that was the same spear that Longius smote our Lord to the heart; and King Pellam was nigh of Joseph's kin, and that was the most worshipful man that lived in those days, and great pity it was of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellam</b></font>) hurt, for through that stroke, turned to great dole, tray and tene.
<p/>I would have my damosel, said Balin. Lo, said Merlin, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lieth dead. Then departed Balin from Merlin, and said, In this world we meet never no more.
<p/>And all that were alive cried, O Balin, thou hast caused great damage in these countries; for the dolorous stroke thou gavest unto King Pellam three countries are destroyed, and doubt not but the vengeance will fall on thee at the last.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rode forth through the fair countries and cities, and found the people dead, slain on every side. When Balin was past those countries he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was passing fain.
<p/>And at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) came into a fair forest in a valley, and was ware of a tower, and there beside he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) saw a great horse of war, tied to a tree, and there beside sat a fair knight on the ground and made great mourning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was a likely man, and a well made.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode eight days or he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) met with adventure. Balin said, God save you, why be ye so heavy? tell me and I will amend it, an I may, to my power.
<p/>Sir knight, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) again, thou dost me great grief, for I was in merry thoughts, and now thou puttest me to more pain.
<p/>Balin went a little from him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>), and looked on his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) horse; then heard Balin him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) say thus: Ah, fair lady, why have ye broken my promise, for thou promisest me to meet me here by noon, and I may curse thee that ever ye gave me this sword, for with this sword I slay myself, and pulled it out.
<p/>And therewith Balin stert unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) by the hand. Let go my hand, said the knight, or else I shall slay thee.
<p/>That shall not need, said Balin, for I shall promise you my help to get you your lady , an ye will tell me where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is.
<p/>Ah, sir, I know you well enough, ye are the Knight with the Two Swords, and the man of most prowess of your hands living.
<p/>My name is Garnish of the Mount, a poor man's son, but by my prowess and hardiness a duke hath made me knight, and gave me lands; his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name is Duke Hermel, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) daughter is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that I love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) me as I deemed.
<p/>What is your name? said the knight. My name is Balin le Savage. What is your name? said Balin. How far is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hence? said Balin.
<p/>But six mile, said the knight. Now ride we hence, said these two knights. So they rode more than a pace, till that they came to a fair castle well walled and ditched.
<p/>I will into the castle, said Balin, and look if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) be there. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) went in and searched from chamber to chamber, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was not there.
<p/>Then Balin looked into a fair little garden, and under a laurel tree he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lie upon a quilt of green samite and a knight in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) arms, fast halsing either other, and under their heads grass and herbs.
<p/>When Balin saw her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lie so with the foulest knight that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) saw, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a fair lady, then Balin went through all the chambers again, and told the knight how he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had slept fast, and so brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) in the place there
<p/>How that knight slew his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) love and a knight lying by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and after, how he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slew himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own sword, and how Balin rode toward a castle where he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) life.
<p/>AND when Garnish beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) so lying, for pure sorrow his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) mouth and nose burst out a-bleeding, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) sword he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) smote off both their heads, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) made sorrow out of measure, and said, O Balin, much sorrow hast thou brought unto me, for hadst thou not shewed me that sight I should have passed my sorrow.
<p/>Forsooth, said Balin, I did it to this intent that it should better thy courage, and that ye might see and know her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) falsehood, and to cause you to leave love of such a lady; God knoweth I did none other
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lay fast sleeping. CHAPTER XVII. but as I would ye did to me. Alas, said Garnish, now is my sorrow double that I may not endure,
<p/>now have I slain that I most loved in all my life; and therewith suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rove himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own sword unto the hilts.
<p/>When Balin saw that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) thenceward, lest folk would say he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) had slain them; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) rode forth, and within three days he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) came by a cross, and thereon were letters of gold written, that said, It is not for no knight alone to ride toward this castle.
<p/>Then saw he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) an old hoar gentleman coming toward him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), that said, Balin le Savage, thou passest thy bounds to come this way, therefore turn again and it will avail thee.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) vanished away anon; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) heard an horn blow as it had been the death of a beast.
<p/>That blast, said Balin, is blown for me, for I am the prize and yet am I not dead. Anon withal
<p/>, that welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) with fair semblant, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) passing good cheer unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) sight, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) into the castle, and there was dancing and minstrelsy and all manner of joy.
<p/>Then the chief lady of the castle said, Knight with the Two Swords, ye must have ado and joust with a knight hereby that keepeth an island, for there may no man pass this way
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw an hundred ladies and many knights but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must joust or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pass. That is an unhappy custom, said Balin, that a knight may not pass this way but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) joust.
<p/>since I shall thereto I am ready, but travelling men are oft weary and their horses too, but though my horse be weary my heart is not weary, I would be fain there my death should be.
<p/>Ye shall not have ado but with one knight, said the lady. Well, said Balin, Sir, said a knight to Balin, methinketh your shield is not good, I will lend you a bigger.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) took the shield that was unknown and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) own, and so rode unto the island, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) horse in a great boat; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) came on the other side he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) met with a damosel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, O knight Balin, why have ye left your own shield?
<p/>ye should have been known; it is great pity of you as ever was of knight, for of thy prowess and hardiness thou hast no fellow living.
<p/>Me repenteth, said Balin, that ever I came within this country, but I may not turn now again for shame, and what adventure shall fall to me, be it life or death, I will take the adventure that shall come to me.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) looked on his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) armour, and understood he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was well armed, and therewith blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) and mounted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) horse.
<p/>How Balin met with his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother Balan, and how each of them slew other unknown, till they were wounded to death.
<p/>THEN afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) saw come riding out of a castle a knight, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse trapped all red, and himself in the same colour.
<p/>When this knight in the red beheld Balin, him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) thought it should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother Balin by cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) two swords, but by cause he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) knew not his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) shield
<p/>Thereof I pray you. alas ye have put yourself in great danger, for by your shield CHAPTER XVIII. he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) deemed it was not he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>).
<p/>And so they aventryd their spears and came marvellously fast together, and they smote each other in the shields, but their spears and their course were so big that it bare down horse and man, that they lay both in a swoon.
<p/>And Balan was the first that rose on foot and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) sword, and went toward Balin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) arose and went against him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>); but Balan smote Balin first, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) shield and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) through the shield and tamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) helm.
<p/>Then Balin smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) again with that unhappy sword, and well-nigh had felled his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) brother Balan, and so they fought there together till their breaths failed.
<p/>But Balin was bruised sore with the fall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) horse, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) was weary of travel. Then Balin looked up to the castle and saw the towers stand full of ladies.
<p/>So they went unto battle again, and wounded everych other dolefully, and then they breathed ofttimes, and so went unto battle that all the place there as they fought was blood red.
<p/>but they had either smitten other seven great wounds, so that the least of them might have been the death of the mightiest giant in this world.
<p/>Then they went to battle again so marvellously that doubt it was to hear of that battle for the great blood-shedding, and their hauberks unnailed that naked they were on every side.
<p/>And at that time there was none of them both At last Balan the younger brother withdrew him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a little and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) down.
<p/>Then said Balin le Savage, What knight art thou? for or now I found never no knight that matched me. My name is, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), Balan, brother unto the good knight, Balin.
<p/>Then Balan yede on all four feet and hands, and put off the helm off his (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) brother, and might not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) by the visage
<p/>it was so ful hewn and bled; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) awoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) said, O Balan, my brother, thou hast slain me
<p/>Alas, said Balin, that ever I should see this day, and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) fell backward in a swoon. and I thee
<p/>Alas, said Balan, that ever I saw this day, that through mishap I might not know you, for I espied well your two swords, but by cause ye had another shield I deemed ye had been another knight.
<p/>Alas, said Balin, all that made an unhappy knight in the castle, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Balin</b></font>) caused me to leave my own shield to our both's destruction, and if I might live I would destroy that castle for ill customs.
<p/>That were well done, said Balan, for I had never grace to depart from them since that I came hither, for here it happed me to slay a knight that kept this island, and since might I never depart, and no more should ye, brother, an ye might have slain me as ye have, and escaped yourself with the life.
<p/>Right so came the lady of the tower with four knights and six ladies and six yeomen unto them, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heard how they made their moan either to other, and said, We came both out of one tomb, that is to say one mother's belly, and so shall we lie both in one pit.
<p/>So Balan prayed the lady of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gentleness, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) true service, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would bury them both in that same place there the battle was done.
<p/>, wherefore all the wide world shall speak of us both. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) granted them, with weeping, it should be done richly in the best manner.
<p/>Now, will ye send for a priest, that we may receive our sacrament, and receive the blessed body of our Lord Jesus Christ?
<p/>Now, said Balin, when we are buried in one tomb, and the mention made over us how two brethren slew each other, there will never good knight, nor good man, see our tomb
<p/>Yea, said the lady, it shall be done; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sent for a priest and gave them their rights. but they will pray for our souls.
<p/>Then anon Balan died, but Balin died not till the midnight after, and so were they buried both, and the lady let make a mention of Balan how he (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) was there slain by his (<font color='blue'><b>Balan</b></font>) brother's hands, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew not Balin's name.
<p/>And so all the ladies and gentlewomen wept for pity. CHAPTER XIX. How Merlin buried them both in one tomb, and of Balin's sword.
<p/>IN the morn came Merlin and let write Balin's name on the tomb with letters of gold, that Here lieth Balin le Savage that was the Knight with the Two Swords, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) that smote the Dolorous Stroke.
<p/>Also Merlin let make there a bed, that there should never man lie therein but he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) went out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) wit,
<p/>yet Launcelot de Lake fordid that bed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lake</b></font>) noblesse. And anon after Balin was dead, Merlin took his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) sword, and took off the pommel and set on another pommel.
<p/>So Merlin bade a knight that stood afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) handle that sword, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) assayed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) might not handle it.
<p/>This is the cause, said Merlin: there shall never man handle this sword but the best knight of the world, and that shall be Sir Launcelot or else Galahad his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) son, and Launcelot with this sword shall slay the man that in the world he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) loved best, that shall be Sir Gawaine.
<p/>Then Merlin let make a bridge of iron and of steel into that island, and it was but half a foot broad, and there shall never man pass that bridge, nor have hardiness to go over, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) were a passing good man and a good knight without treachery or villainy.
<p/>Then Merlin laughed. Why laugh ye? said the knight. All this he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) let write in the pommel of the sword. Also the scabbard of Balin's sword Merlin left it on this side the island, that Galahad should find it.
<p/>Also Merlin let make by his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) subtilty that Balin's sword was put in a marble stone standing upright as great as a mill stone, and the stone hoved always above the water and did many years, and so by adventure it swam down the stream to the City of Camelot, that is in English Winchester.
<p/>And that same day Galahad the haut prince came with King Arthur, and so Galahad brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the scabbard and achieved the sword that was there in the marble stone hoving upon the water.
<p/>Soon after this was done Merlin came to King Arthur and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) of the dolorous stroke that Balin gave to King Pellam, and how Balin and Balan fought together the marvellest battle that ever was heard of, and how they were buried both in one tomb.
<p/>Alas, said King Arthur, this is the greatest pity that ever I heard tell of two knights, for in the world
<p/>And on Whitsunday he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) achieved the sword as it is rehearsed in the book of Sangreal. I know not such two knights.
<p/>Thus endeth the tale of Balin and of Balan, two brethren born in Northumberland, good knights. Sequitur iii liber. BOOK III.
<p/>How King Arthur took a wife, and wedded Guenever, daughter to Leodegrance, King of the Land of Cameliard, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had the Round Table.
<p/>IN the beginning of Arthur, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was chosen king by adventure and by grace; for the most part of the barons knew not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was Uther Pendragon's son, but as Merlin made it openly known.
<p/>But yet many kings and lords held great war against him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) for that cause, but well Arthur overcame them all, for the most part the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) life
<p/>CHAPTER I. he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was ruled much by the counsel of Merlin. So it fell on a time King Arthur said unto Merlin
<p/>, My barons will let me have no rest, but needs I must take a wife, and I will none take but by thy counsel and by thine advice.
<p/>It is well done, said Merlin, that ye take a wife, for a man of your bounty and noblesse should not be without a wife.
<p/>Yea, said King Arthur, I love Guenever the king's daughter, Leodegrance of the land of Cameliard, the which holdeth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) house the Table Round that ye told he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had of my father Uther.
<p/>And this damosel is the most valiant and fairest lady that I know living, or yet that ever I could find.
<p/>Sir, said Merlin, as of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty and fairness she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is one of the fairest alive, but, an ye loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) not so well
<p/>as ye do, I should find you a damosel of beauty and of goodness that should like you and please you, an your heart were not set; but there as a man's heart is set, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be loath to return.
<p/>But Merlin warned the king covertly that Guenever was not wholesome for him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) to take to wife, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) that Launcelot should love her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) again; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) tale to the adventures of Sangreal.
<p/>Then Merlin desired of the king for to have men with him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) that should enquire of Guenever, and so the king granted him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and Merlin went forth unto King Leodegrance of Cameliard, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) of the desires of the king that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would have unto his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife Guenever his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>That is to me, said King Leodegrance, the best tidings that ever I heard, that so worthy a king of prowess and noblesse
<p/>Now is there any that ye love more than another? That is truth, said King Arthur. will wed my daughter. And as for my lands, I will give him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), wist
<p/>I it might please him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hath lands enow, him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) needeth none; but I shall send him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a gift shall please him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) much more, for I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) the Table Round, the which Uther Pendragon gave me, and when it is full complete, there is an hundred knights and fifty.
<p/>And as for an hundred good knights I have myself, but I faute fifty, for so many have been slain in my days.
<p/>And so Leodegrance delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Leodegrance</b></font>) daughter Guenever unto Merlin, and the Table Round with the hundred knights, and so they rode freshly, with great royalty, what by water and what by land, till that they came nigh unto London.
<p/>WHEN King Arthur heard of the coming of Guenever and the hundred knights with the Table Round, then King Arthur made great joy for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) coming, and that rich present, and said openly, This fair lady is passing welcome unto me, for I have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) long, and therefore there is nothing so lief to me.
<p/>CHAPTER II. How the Knights of the Round Table were ordained and their sieges blessed by the Bishop of Canterbury. And these knights with the Round Table please me more than right great riches.
<p/>And in all haste the king let ordain for the marriage and the coronation in the most honourable wise that could be devised.
<p/>Now, Merlin, said King Arthur, go thou and espy me in all this land fifty knights which be of most prowess and worship.
<p/>Within short time Merlin had found such knights that should fulfil twenty and eight knights, but no more he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) could find.
<p/>Then the Bishop of Canterbury was fetched, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) blessed the sieges with great royalty and devotion, and there set the eight and twenty knights in their sieges.
<p/>And when this was done Merlin said, Fair sirs, ye must all arise and come to King Arthur for to do him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) homage; he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will have the better will to maintain you.
<p/>And so they arose and did their homage, and when they were gone Merlin found in every sieges letters of gold that told the knights' names that had sitten therein.
<p/>But two sieges were void. And so anon came young Gawaine and asked the king a gift. Ask, said the king, and I shall grant it you.
<p/>I will do it with a good will, said King Arthur, and do unto you all the worship that I may, for I must by reason ye are my nephew, my sister's son.
<p/>Sir, I ask that ye will make me knight that same day ye shall wed fair Guenever. CHAPTER III. How a poor man riding upon a lean mare desired King Arthur to make his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) son knight.
<p/>there came a poor man into the court, and brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a fair young man of eighteen years of age riding upon a lean mare; and the poor man asked all men that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met, Where shall I find King Arthur?
<p/>FORTHWITHAL Yonder he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is, said the knights, wilt thou anything with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)? Yea, said the poor man, therefore I came hither.
<p/>Anon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came before the king, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and said: O King Arthur, the flower of all knights and kings, I beseech Jesu save thee.
<p/>Sir, it was told me that at this time of your marriage ye would give any man the gift that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would ask, out except that were unreasonable.
<p/>That is truth, said the king, such cries I let make, and that will I hold, so it apair not my realm nor mine estate.
<p/>Ye say well and graciously, said the poor man; Sir, I ask nothing else but that ye will make my son here a knight.
<p/>It is a great thing thou askest of me, said the king. What is thy name? said the king to the poor man.
<p/>Nay, sir, said Aries, this desire cometh of my son and not of me, for I shall tell you I have thirteen sons, and all they will fall to what labour I put them, and will be right glad to do labour, but this child will not labour for me, for anything that my wife or I may do, but always he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will be shooting or casting darts, and glad for to see battles and to behold knights, and
<p/>Sir, my name is Aries the cowherd. Whether cometh this of thee or of thy son? said the king. always day and night he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) desireth of me to be made a knight.
<p/>What is thy name? said the king unto the young man. Sir, my name is Tor. The king beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fast, and saw he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was passingly well-visaged and passingly well made of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) years.
<p/>Well, said King Arthur unto Aries the cowherd, fetch all thy sons afore me that I may see them. And so the poor man did, and all were shaped much like the poor man.
<p/>But Tor was not like none of them all in shape nor in countenance, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) was much more than any of them.
<p/>Now, said King Arthur unto the cow herd, where is the sword he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) shall be made knight withal? It is here, said Tor.
<p/>Then Tor alighted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) mare and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) sword, kneeling, and requiring the king that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would make him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knight, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might be a knight of the Table Round.
<p/>As for a knight I will make you, and therewith smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in the neck with the sword, saying, Be ye a good knight, and so I pray to God so ye may be, and if ye be of prowess and of worthiness ye shall be a knight of the Table Round.
<p/>Take it out of the sheath, said the king, and require me to make you a knight. Now Merlin, said Arthur, say whether this Tor shall be a good knight or no.
<p/>Yea, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ought to be a good knight, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is come of as good a man as any is alive, and of kings' blood.
<p/>This poor man, Aries the cowherd, is not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is nothing sib to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for King Pellinore is his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) father.
<p/>How so, sir? said the king. I shall tell you, said Merlin: I suppose nay, said the cowherd. Fetch thy wife afore me, said Merlin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) shall not say nay.
<p/>Anon the wife was fetched, which was a fair housewife, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered Merlin full womanly, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) told the king and Merlin that when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a maid, and went to milk kine, there met with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a stern knight, and half by force he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had my maidenhead, and at that time he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) begat my son Tor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) took away from me my greyhound that I had that time with me, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) would keep the greyhound for my love.
<p/>Ah, said the cowherd, I weened not this, but I may believe it well, for he (<font color='blue'><b>cowherd</b></font>) had never no tatches of me.
<p/>Sir, said Merlin, it is more for your worship than hurt, for your father is a good man and a king, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may right well advance you and your mother, for ye were begotten or ever she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was wedded.
<p/>Sir, said Tor unto Merlin, dishonour not my mother. That is truth, said the wife. It is the less grief unto me, said the cowherd.
<p/>SO on the morn King Pellinore came to the court of King Arthur, which had great joy of him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) of Tor, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) son, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) knight at the request of the cowherd.
<p/>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Tor was known for son of King Pellinore, and how Gawaine was made knight. When Pellinore beheld Tor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) much.
<p/>So the king made Gawaine knight, but Tor was the first he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) made at the feast. What is the cause, said King Arthur, that there be two places void in the sieges?
<p/>But in the Siege Perilous there shall no man sit therein but one, and if there be any so hardy to do it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall be destroyed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that shall sit there shall have no fellow.
<p/>And therewith Merlin took King Pellinore by the hand, and in the one hand next the two sieges and the Siege Perilous he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) said, in open audience,
<p/>Sir, said Merlin, there shall no man sit in those places but they that shall be of most worship. This is your place and best ye are worthy to sit therein of any that is here.
<p/>Thereat sat Sir Gawaine in great envy and told Gaheris his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) brother, yonder knight is put to great worship, the which grieveth me sore, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) slew our father King Lot, therefore I will slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), said Gawaine, with a sword that was sent me that is passing trenchant.
<p/>Ye shall not so, said Gaheris, at this time, for at this time I am but a squire, and when I am made knight I will be avenged on him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and therefore, brother, it is best ye suffer till another time, that we may have him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) out of the court, for an we did
<p/>How at feast of the wedding of King Arthur to Guenever, a white hart came into the hall, and thirty couple hounds, and how a brachet pinched the hart which was taken away.
<p/>THEN was the high feast made ready, and the king was wedded at Camelot unto Dame Guenever in the church of Saint Stephen's, with great solemnity.
<p/>And as every man was set after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) degree, Merlin went to all the knights of the Round Table, and bade them sit still, that none of them remove.
<p/>so we should trouble this high feast. I will well, said Gawaine, as ye will. CHAPTER V. For ye shall see a strange and a marvellous adventure.
<p/>Right so as they sat there came running in a white hart into the hall, and a white brachet next him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and thirty couple of black running hounds came after with a great cry, and the hart went about the Table Round as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) went by other boards.
<p/>The white brachet bit him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) by the buttock and pulled out a piece, wherethrough the hart leapt a great leap and overthrew a knight that sat at the board side; and therewith the knight arose and took up the brachet, and so went forth out of the hall, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and rode his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) way with the brachet.
<p/>Right so anon came in a lady on a white palfrey, and cried aloud to King Arthur, Sir, suffer me not to have this despite, for the brachet was mine that the knight led away.
<p/>With this there came a knight riding all armed on a great horse, and took the lady away with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) with force, and ever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried and made great dole.
<p/>I may not do therewith, said the king. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was gone the king was glad, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made such a noise.
<p/>Nay, said Merlin, ye may not leave these adventures so lightly; for these adventures must be brought again or else it would be disworship to you and to your feast.
<p/>I will, said the king, that all be done by your advice. Then, said Merlin, let call Sir Gawaine, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) must bring again the white hart.
<p/>Also, sir, ye must let call Sir Tor, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) must bring again the brachet and the knight, or else slay him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Also let call King Pellinore, for he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) must bring again the lady and the knight, or else slay him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). And these three knights shall do marvellous adventures or they come again.
<p/>Then were they called all three as it rehearseth afore, and each of them took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) charge, and armed them surely.
<p/>How Sir Gawaine rode for to fetch again the hart, and how two brethren fought each against other for the hart.
<p/>SIR GAWAINE rode more than a pace, and Gaheris his (<font color='blue'><b>GAWAINE</b></font>) brother that rode with him (<font color='blue'><b>GAWAINE</b></font>) instead of a squire to do him (<font color='blue'><b>GAWAINE</b></font>) service.
<p/>So as they rode they saw two knights fight on horseback passing sore, so Sir Gawaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) brother rode betwixt them, and asked them for what cause they fought so.
<p/>The one knight answered and said, We fight for a simple matter, for we two be two brethren born and begotten of one man and of one woman.
<p/>But Sir Gawaine had the first request, and therefore we will begin at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>). CHAPTER VI. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, why do ye so?
<p/>Sir, said the elder, there came a white hart this way this day, and many hounds chased him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and a white brachet was alway next him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and we understood it was adventure made for the high feast of King Arthur, and therefore I would have gone after to have won me worship; and here my younger brother said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would go after the hart, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was better knight than I: and for this cause we fell at debate, and so we thought to prove which of us both was better knight.
<p/>This is a simple cause, said Sir Gawaine; uncouth men ye should debate withal, and not brother with brother; therefore but if you will do by my counsel I will have ado with you, that is ye shall yield you unto me, and that ye go unto King Arthur and yield you unto his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) grace.
<p/>Sir knight, said the two brethren, we are forfoughten and much blood have we lost through our wilfulness, and therefore we would be loath to have ado with you.
<p/>Then do as I will have you, said Sir Gawaine. We will agree to fulfil your will; but by whom shall we say that we be thither sent?
<p/>Ye may say, By the knight that followeth the quest of the hart that was white. Now what is your name? said Gawaine.
<p/>Sorlouse of the Forest, said the elder. And my name is, said the younger, Brian of the Forest. And so they departed and went to the king's court, and Sir Gawaine on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) quest.
<p/>And as Gawaine followed the hart by the cry of the hounds, even afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) there was a great river, and the hart swam over; and as Sir Gawaine would follow after, there stood a knight over the other side, and said, Sir knight, come not over after this hart but if thou wilt joust with me.
<p/>I will not fail as for that, said Sir Gawaine, to follow the quest that I am in, and so made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse to swim over the water.
<p/>And anon they gat their spears and ran together full hard; but Sir Gawaine smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>).
<p/>Nay, said the knight, not so, though thou have the better of me on horseback. I pray thee, valiant knight, alight afoot, and match we together with swords.
<p/>Then either dressed their shields and smote together, but Sir Gawaine smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) so hard through the helm that it went to the brains, and the knight fell down dead.
<p/>What is your name? said Sir Gawaine. Allardin of the Isles, said the other. Ah! said Gaheris, that was a mighty stroke of a young knight.
<p/>THEN Gawaine and Gaheris rode more than a pace after the white hart, and let slip at the hart three couple of greyhounds, and so they chased the hart into a castle, and in the chief place of the castle they slew the hart; Sir Gawaine and Gaheris followed after.
<p/>CHAPTER VII How the hart was chased into a castle and there slain, and how Sir Gawaine slew a lady. Right
<p/>so there came a knight out of a chamber with a sword drawn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) hand and slew two of the greyhounds, even in the sight of Sir Gawaine, and the remnant he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) chased them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sword out of the castle.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) came again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) said, O my white hart, me repenteth that thou art dead, for my sovereign lady gave thee to me, and evil have
<p/>And anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) chamber and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and came out fiercely, and there met he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) with Sir Gawaine.
<p/>I kept thee, and thy death shall be dear bought an I live. Why have ye slain my hounds? said Sir Gawaine, for they did but their kind, and liefer
<p/>Thou sayest truth, said the knight, I have avenged me on thy hounds, and so I will on thee or thou go.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine alighted afoot and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) shield, and struck together mightily, and clave their shields, and stoned their helms, and brake their hauberks that the blood ran down to their feet.
<p/>At the last Sir Gawaine smote the knight so hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fell to the earth, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) cried mercy, and yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and besought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was a knight and gentleman, to save his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life.
<p/>I had ye had wroken your anger upon me than upon a dumb beast. Thou shalt die, said Sir Gawaine, for slaying of my hounds.
<p/>I will make amends, said the knight, unto my power. Sir Gawaine would no mercy have, but unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) helm to have stricken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) head.
<p/>Right so came his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) lady out of a chamber and fell over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) smote off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head by misadventure.
<p/>Alas, said Gaheris, that is foully and shamefully done, that shame shall never from you; also ye should give mercy unto them that ask mercy, for a knight without mercy is without worship.
<p/>Sir Gawaine was so stonied of the death of this fair lady that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) wist not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) did, and said unto the knight, Arise, I will give thee mercy.
<p/>Nay, nay, said the knight, I take no force of mercy now, for thou hast slain my love and my lady that I loved best of all earthly things.
<p/>Me sore repenteth it, said Sir Gawaine, for I thought to strike unto thee; but now thou shalt go unto King Arthur and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) of thine adventures, and how thou art overcome by the knight that went in the quest of the white hart.
<p/>I take no force, said the knight, whether I live or I die; but so for dread of death he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) swore to go unto King Arthur, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to bear one greyhound before him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horse, and another behind him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>What is your name? said Sir Gawaine, or we depart. My name is, said the knight, Ablamar of the Marsh. So he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) departed toward Camelot.
<p/>How four knights fought against Gawaine and Gaheris, and how they were overcome, and their lives saved at request of four ladies.
<p/>AND Sir Gawaine went into the castle, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) ready to lie there all night, and would have unarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>).
<p/>CHAPTER VIII. What will ye do, said Gaheris, will ye unarm you in this country? Ye may think ye have many enemies here.
<p/>They had not sooner said that word but there came four knights well armed, and assailed Sir Gawaine hard, and said unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), Thou new-made knight, thou hast shamed thy knighthood, for a knight without mercy is dishonoured.
<p/>Also thou hast slain a fair lady to thy great shame to the world's end, and doubt thou not thou shalt have great need of mercy or thou depart from us.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell to the earth, and Gaheris smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) again sore, and so they were on the one side and on the other, that Sir Gawaine and Gaheris were in jeopardy of their lives; and one with a bow, an archer, smote Sir Gawaine through the arm that it grieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) wonderly sore.
<p/>And as they should have been slain, there came four fair ladies, and besought the knights of grace for Sir Gawaine; and goodly at request of the ladies they gave Sir Gawaine and Gaheris their lives, and made them to yield them as prisoners.
<p/>And therewith one of them smote Sir Gawaine a great stroke that nigh Then Gawaine and Gaheris made great dole. Alas! said Sir Gawaine, mine arm grieveth me sore
<p/>Early on the morrow there came to Sir Gawaine one of the four ladies that had heard all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) complaint, and said, Sir knight, what cheer?
<p/>It is your own default, said the lady, for ye have done a passing foul deed in the slaying of the lady, the which will be great villainy unto you.
<p/>, I am like to be maimed; and so made his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) complaint piteously. Not good, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). But be ye not of King Arthur's kin? said the lady.
<p/>Yes truly, said Sir Gawaine. What is your name? said the lady, ye must tell it me or ye pass. My name is Gawaine, the King Lot of Orkney's son, and my mother is King Arthur's sister.
<p/>then are ye nephew unto King Arthur, said the lady, and I shall so speak for you that ye shall have conduct to go to King Arthur for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) love.
<p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) departed and told the four knights how their prisoner was King Arthur's nephew, and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) name is Sir Gawaine, King Lot's son of Orkney.
<p/>Then anon they delivered Sir Gawaine under this promise, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) should bear the dead lady with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) in this manner; the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was hanged about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) neck, and the whole body of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse's mane.
<p/>Ah! And they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) the hart's head because it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) quest. Right so rode he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) forth unto Camelot.
<p/>And anon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was come, Merlin desired of King Arthur that Sir Gawaine should be sworn to tell of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) adventures, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) slew the lady, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) would give no mercy unto the knight, wherethrough the lady was slain.
<p/>And there by ordinance of the queen there was set a quest of ladies on Sir Gawaine, and they judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) for ever while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) lived to be with all ladies, and to fight for their quarrels; and that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) should be courteous, and never to refuse mercy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) that asketh mercy.
<p/>Thus was Gawaine sworn upon the Four Evangelists that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) should never be against lady nor gentlewoman, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fought for a lady and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) adversary fought for another.
<p/>Then the king and the queen were greatly displeased with Sir Gawaine for the slaying of the lady. And thus endeth the adventure of Sir Gawaine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) did at the marriage of King Arthur.
<p/>Amen. CHAPTER IX. How Sir Tor rode after the knight with the brachet, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) adventure by the way. WHEN Sir Tor was ready, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) mounted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) horseback, and rode after the knight with the brachet.
<p/>So as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) rode he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) met with a dwarf suddenly that smote his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) horse on the head with a staff, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) went backward his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) spear length.
<p/>Why dost thou so? said Sir Tor. For thou shalt not pass this way, but if thou joust with yonder knights of the pavilions.
<p/>Then was Tor ware where two pavilions were, and great spears stood out, and two shields hung on trees by the pavilions.
<p/>I may not tarry, said Sir Tor, for I am in a quest that I must needs follow. Thou shalt not pass, said the dwarf, and therewithal
<p/>Then there came one armed on horseback, and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) shield, and came fast toward Tor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>), and so ran together that Tor bare him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) horse.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) horn. And anon the knight yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) mercy. But, sir, I have a fellow in yonder pavilion that will have ado with you anon.
<p/>Then was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) ware of another knight coming with great raundon, and each of them dressed to other, that marvel it was to see; but the knight smote Sir Tor a great stroke in midst of the shield that his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear all to-shivered.
<p/>And Sir Tor smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) through the shield below of the shield that it went through the cost of the knight, but the stroke slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) not.
<p/>And therewith Sir Tor alighted and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) on the helm a great stroke, and therewith the knight yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and besought him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of mercy.
<p/>I will well, said Sir Tor, but thou and thy fellow must go unto King Arthur, and yield you prisoners unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) shall be welcome, said Sir Tor. By whom shall we say are we thither sent? Ye shall say by the knight that went in the quest of the knight that went with the brachet.
<p/>My name is, said the one, Sir Felot of Langduk; and my name is, said the other, Sir Petipase of Winchelsea.
<p/>Now, what be your two names? said Sir Tor. Now go ye forth, said Sir Tor, and God speed you and me.
<p/>Then came the dwarf and said unto Sir Tor, I pray you give me a gift. I will well, said Sir Tor, ask.
<p/>I ask no more, said the dwarf, but that ye will suffer me to do you service, for I will serve no more recreant knights.
<p/>I wot ye ride after the knight with the white brachet, and I shall bring you where he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is, said the dwarf.
<p/>And so they rode throughout a forest, and at the last they were ware of two pavilions, even by a priory, with two shields, and the one shield was enewed with white, and the other shield was red.
<p/>Take an horse, said Sir Tor, and ride on with me. CHAPTER X. How Sir Tor found the brachet with a lady, and how a knight assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) for the said brachet.
<p/>THEREWITH Sir Tor alighted and took the dwarf his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) glaive, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) came to the white pavilion, and saw three damosels lie in it, on one pallet, sleeping, and
<p/>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) went to the other pavilion, and found a lady lying sleeping therein, but there was the white brachet that bayed at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fast, and therewith the lady yede out of the pavilion and all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) damosels.
<p/>But anon as Sir Tor espied the white brachet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by force and took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to the dwarf. What, will ye so, said the lady, take my brachet from me?
<p/>Yea, said Sir Tor, this brachet have I sought from King Arthur's court hither. Well, said the lady, knight, ye shall not go far with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but that ye shall be met and grieved.
<p/>I shall abide what adventure that cometh by the grace of God, and so mounted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) horse, and passed on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) way toward Camelot; but it was so near night he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might not pass but little further.
<p/>I know none, said the dwarf, but here beside is an hermitage, and there ye must take lodging as ye find.
<p/>And within a while they came to the hermitage and took lodging; and was there grass, oats and bread for their horses; soon it was sped, and full hard was their supper; but there they rested them all night till on the morn, and heard a mass devoutly, and took their leave of the hermit, and Sir Tor prayed the hermit to pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>).
<p/>Know ye any lodging? said Tor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) would, and betook him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) to God. And so mounted upon horseback and rode towards Camelot a long while.
<p/>With that they heard a knight call loud that came after them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, Knight, abide and yield my brachet that thou took from my lady.
<p/>Sir Tor returned again, and beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) was a seemly knight and well horsed, and well armed at all points; then Sir Tor dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) shield, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) hands, and the other came fiercely upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>), and smote both horse and man to the earth.
<p/>Anon they arose lightly and drew their swords as eagerly as lions, and put their shields afore them, and smote through the shields, that the cantels fell off both parties.
<p/>Also they tamed their helms that the hot blood ran out, and the thick mails of their hauberks they carved and rove in sunder that the hot blood ran to the earth, and both they had many wounds and were passing weary.
<p/>But Sir Tor espied that the other knight fainted, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) sued fast upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>), and doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) strokes, and gart him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) go to the earth on the one side.
<p/>That will I not, said Abelleus, while my life lasteth and the soul is within my body, unless that thou wilt give me the brachet.
<p/>That will I not do, said Sir Tor, for it was my quest to bring again thy brachet, thee, or both.
<p/>Then Sir Tor bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>). CHAPTER XI. How Sir Tor overcame the knight, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) head at the request of a lady.
<p/>WITH that came a damosel riding on a palfrey as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might drive, and cried with a loud voice unto Sir Tor.
<p/>What will ye with me? said Sir Tor. I beseech thee, said the damosel, for King Arthur's love, give me a gift
<p/>; I require thee, gentle knight, as thou art a gentleman. Now, said Tor, ask a gift and I will give it you.
<p/>Gramercy, said the damosel; now I ask the head of the false knight Abelleus, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is the most outrageous knight that liveth, and the greatest murderer.
<p/>I am loath, said Sir Tor, of that gift I have given you; let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) make amends in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) hath trespassed unto you.
<p/>Now, said the damosel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) may not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) slew mine own brother before mine own eyes, that was a better knight than he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), an he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had had grace; and I kneeled half an hour afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in the mire for to save my brother's life, that had done him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) no damage, but fought with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) by adventure of arms, and so for all that I could do he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) struck off his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head; wherefore I require thee, as thou art a true knight, to give me my gift, or else I shall shame thee in all the court of King Arthur; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is the falsest knight living, and a great destroyer of good knights.
<p/>I may not now, said Sir Tor, but if I should be found false of my promise; for while I would have taken you to mercy ye would none ask, but if ye had the brachet again, that was my quest.
<p/>And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) helm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) arose and fled, and Sir Tor after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>), and smote off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) head quite.
<p/>Now sir, said the damosel, it is near night; I pray you come and lodge with me here at my place, it is here fast by.
<p/>Then when Abelleus heard this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) was more afeard, and yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) and asked mercy. I will well, said Sir Tor, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) horse
<p/>and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) rode with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>), and had passing good cheer with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) had a passing fair old knight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) husband that made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) passing good cheer, and well eased both his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And on the morn he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mass, and brake his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fast, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) leave of the knight and of the lady, that besought him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to tell them his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name.
<p/>Truly, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, my name is Sir Tor that was late made knight, and this was the first quest of arms that ever I did, to bring again that this knight Abelleus took away from King Arthur's court.
<p/>O fair knight, said the lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, an ye come here in our marches, come and see our poor lodging, and it shall be always at your commandment.
<p/>So Sir Tor departed and came to Camelot on the third day by noon, and the king and the queen and all the court was passing fain of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) coming, and made great joy that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was come again; for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) went from the court with little succour, but as King Pellinore his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) father gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) an old courser, and King Arthur gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) armour and a sword, and else had he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) none other succour, but rode so forth himself alone.
<p/>And then the king and the queen by Merlin's advice made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to swear to tell of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) adventures, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) told and made proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) deeds as it is afore rehearsed, wherefore the king and the queen made great joy.
<p/>Nay, nay, said Merlin, these be but japes to that he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) shall do; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) shall prove a noble knight of prowess, as good as any is living, and gentle and courteous, and of good tatches, and passing true of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) promise, and never shall outrage.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had fared evil since they departed from Camelot, Wherethrough Merlin's words King Arthur gave him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) an earldom of lands that fell unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>How King Pellinore rode after the lady and the knight that led her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) away, and how a lady desired help of him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fought with two knights for that lady, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) slew the one at the first stroke.
<p/>THEN King Pellinore armed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and mounted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horse, and rode more than a pace after the lady that the knight led away.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode in a forest, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw in a valley a damosel sit by a well, and a wounded knight in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms, and Pellinore saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>And here endeth the quest of Sir Tor, King Pellinore's son. CHAPTER XII. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was ware of him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried overloud, Help me, knight; for Christ's sake, King Pellinore.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would not tarry, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was so eager in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) quest, and ever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried an hundred times after help.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would not abide, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prayed unto God to send him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as much need of help as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might feel it or he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) died.
<p/>So, as the book telleth, the knight there died that there was wounded, wherefore the lady for pure sorrow slew herself with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword.
<p/>As King Pellinore rode in that valley he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) met with a poor man, a labourer. Sawest thou not, said Pellinore, a knight riding and leading away a lady?
<p/>Yea, said the man, I saw that knight, and the lady that made great dole; and yonder beneath in a valley there shall ye see two pavilions, and one of the knights of the pavilions challenged that lady of that knight, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) cousin near, wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should lead her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) no farther.
<p/>And so they waged battle in that quarrel, the one said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by force, and the other said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have the rule of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), by cause he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kinsman, and would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kin.
<p/>And if ye will ride a pace ye shall find them fighting, and the lady was beleft with the two squires in the pavilions.
<p/>For this quarrel he (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) left them fighting. God thank thee, said King Pellinore. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rode a wallop till he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had a sight of the two pavilions, and the two knights fighting.
<p/>Anon he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rode unto the pavilions, and saw the lady that was his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) quest, and said, Fair lady, ye must go with me unto the court of King Arthur.
<p/>Sir knight, said the two squires that were with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), yonder are two knights that fight for this lady, go thither and depart them, and be agreed with them, and then may ye have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at your pleasure.
<p/>Ye say well, said King Pellinore. And anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) rode betwixt them, and departed them, and asked them the causes why that they fought?
<p/>Sir knight, said the one, I shall tell you, this lady is my kinswoman nigh, mine aunt's daughter, and when I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) complain that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) maugre her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, I waged battle to fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Sir knight, said the other, whose name was Hontzlake of Wentland, and this lady I gat by my prowess of arms this day at Arthur's court.
<p/>That is untruly said, said King Pellinore, for ye came in suddenly there as we were at the high feast, and took away this lady or any man might make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ready; and therefore it was my quest to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again
<p/>; therefore the lady shall go with me, or I will die for it, for I have promised it King Arthur.
<p/>for none of you shall have no part of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at this time; and if ye list to fight for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), fight with me, and I will defend her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>and you both, or else the one of us to abide in the field And therefore fight ye no more, Well, said the knights, make you ready, and we shall assail you with all our power.
<p/>And as King Pellinore would have put his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horse from them, Sir Hontzlake rove his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horse through with a sword, and said: Now art thou on foot as well as we are.
<p/>When King Pellinore espied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) horse was slain, lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) leapt from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) horse and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) sword, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) shield afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>), and said, Knight, keep well thy head, for thou shalt have a buffet for the slaying of my horse.
<p/>So King Pellinore gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) such a stroke upon the helm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) clave the head down to the chin, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) fell to the earth dead.
<p/>CHAPTER XIII. How King Pellinore gat the lady and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to Camelot to the court of King Arthur. AND then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) turned him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to the other knight, that was sore wounded.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) saw the other's buffet, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would not fight, but kneeled down and said, Take my cousin the lady with you at your request, and I require you, as ye be a true knight, put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to no shame nor villainy.
<p/>What, said King Pellinore, will ye not fight for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? No, sir, said the knight, I will not fight with such a knight of prowess as ye be.
<p/>; I promise you she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shall have no villainy by me, as I am true knight; but now me lacketh an horse, said Pellinore, but I will have Hontzlake's horse.
<p/>Ye shall not need, said the knight, for I shall give you such an horse as shall please you, so that you will lodge with me, for it is near night.
<p/>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) right good cheer, and fared of the best with passing good wine, and had merry rest that night.
<p/>And on the morn he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) heard a mass and dined; and then was brought him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) a fair bay courser, and King Pellinore's saddle set upon him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>Well, said Pellinore, ye say well I will well, said King Pellinore, abide with you all night. Now, what shall I call you?
<p/>said the knight, inasmuch as ye have my cousin at your desire of your quest. Sir, I shall tell you, my name is King Pellinore of the Isles and knight of the Table Round.
<p/>Now I am glad, said the knight, that such a noble man shall have the rule of my cousin. Now, what is your name?
<p/>Sir, my name is Sir Meliot of Logurs, and this lady my cousin hight Nimue, and the knight that was in the other pavilion is my sworn brother, a passing good knight, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name is Brian of the Isles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is full loath to do wrong, and full loath to fight with any man, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be sore sought on, so that for shame he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may not leave it.
<p/>said Pellinore, I pray you tell me. It is marvel, said Pellinore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) will not have ado with me. Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) will not have ado with no man
<p/>but if it be at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) request. Bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) to the court, said Pellinore, one of these days. Sir, we will come together.
<p/>And ye shall be welcome, said Pellinore, to the court of King Arthur, and greatly allowed for your coming. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) departed with the lady, and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to Camelot.
<p/>So as they rode in a valley it was full of stones, and there the lady's horse stumbled and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) down, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm was sore bruised and near
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) swooned for pain. Alas! sir, said the lady, mine arm is out of lithe, wherethrough I must needs rest me.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) alighted under a fair tree where was fair grass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) horse thereto, and so laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) under the tree and slept till it was nigh night.
<p/>Ye shall well, said King Pellinore. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) awoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) would have ridden. Sir, said the lady, it is so dark that ye may as well ride backward as forward.
<p/>So they abode still and made there their lodging. Then Sir Pellinore put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) armour; then a little afore midnight they heard the trotting of an horse.
<p/>Be ye still, said King Pellinore, for we shall hear of some adventure. CHAPTER XIV. How on the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) heard two knights, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) lay by night in a valley, and of their adventures.
<p/>So right even afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) there met two knights, the one came froward Camelot, and the other from the north, and either saluted other.
<p/>By my head, said the other, there have I been and espied the court of King Arthur, and there is such a fellowship they may never be broken, and well-nigh all the world holdeth with Arthur, for there is the flower of chivalry.
<p/>Now for this cause I am riding into the north, to tell our chieftains of the fellowship that is withholden with King Arthur.
<p/>As for that, said the other knight, I have brought a remedy with me, that is the greatest poison that ever ye heard speak of, and to Camelot will I with it, for we have a friend right nigh King Arthur, and well cherished, that shall poison King Arthur; for so he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hath promised our chieftains, and received great gifts for to do it.
<p/>AND therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) armed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). What tidings at Camelot? said the one. Beware, said the other knight, of Merlin, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) knoweth all things by the devil's craft.
<p/>Anon after Pellinore made him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) ready, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) lady, -LSB-and-RSB- rode toward Camelot; and as they came by the well there as the wounded knight was and the lady, there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) found the knight, and the lady eaten with lions or wild beasts, all save the head, wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made great sorrow, and wept passing sore, and said, Alas!
<p/>Therefore will I not let it, said the knight. And so they departed asunder. her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life might I have saved; but I was so fierce in my quest, therefore I would not abide.
<p/>I wot not, said Pellinore, but my heart mourneth sore of the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a passing fair lady and a young.
<p/>said the lady, take this knight and let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be buried in an hermitage, and then take the lady's head and bear it with you unto Arthur.
<p/>So King Pellinore took this dead knight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) shoulders, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) to the hermitage, and charged the hermit with the corpse, that service should be done for the soul; and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) harness for your pain.
<p/>Wherefore make ye such dole? said the lady. Now, will ye do by mine advice? It shall be done, said the hermit, as I will answer unto God.
<p/>CHAPTER XV. How when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was come to Camelot he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was sworn upon a book to tell the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) quest.
<p/>AND therewith they departed, and came there as the head of the lady lay with a fair yellow hair that grieved King Pellinore passingly sore when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) looked on it, for much he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) heart on the visage.
<p/>And so by noon they came to Camelot; and the king and the queen were passing fain of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) coming to the court.
<p/>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was made to swear upon the Four Evangelists, to tell the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) quest from the one to the other.
<p/>Ah! Sir Pellinore, said Queen Guenever, ye were greatly to blame that ye saved not this lady's life. Madam, said Pellinore, ye were greatly to blame an ye would not save your own life
<p/>, save your pleasure, I was so furious in my quest that I would not abide, and that repenteth me, and shall the days of my life.
<p/>Truly, said Merlin, ye ought sore to repent it, for that lady was your own daughter begotten on the lady of the Rule, and that knight that was dead was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) love, and should have wedded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was a right good knight of a young man, and would have proved a good man, and to this court was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was Sir Miles of the Launds, and a knight came behind him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and slew him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) with a spear, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name is Loraine le Savage, a false knight and a coward; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for great sorrow and dole slew herself with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name was Eleine.
<p/>And because ye would not abide and help her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), ye shall see your best friend fail you when ye be in the greatest distress that ever ye were or shall be.
<p/>And that penance God hath ordained you for that deed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that ye shall most trust to of any man alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shall leave you there
<p/>an ye might, but ye shall be slain. Me forthinketh, said King Pellinore, that this shall me betide, but God may fordo well destiny.
<p/>Thus, when the quest was done of the white hart, the which followed Sir Gawaine; and the quest of the brachet, followed of Sir Tor, Pellinore's son; and the quest of the lady that the knight took away, the which King Pellinore at that time followed; then the king stablished all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) knights, and them that were of lands not rich he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) gave them lands, and charged them never to do outrageousity nor murder, and always to flee treason; also, by no means to be cruel, but to give mercy unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) that asketh mercy, upon pain of forfeiture of their worship and lordship of King Arthur for evermore; and always to do ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen succour, upon pain of death.
<p/>Also, that no man take no battles in a wrongful quarrel for no law, nor for no world's goods. Unto this were all the knights sworn of the Table Round, both old and young.
<p/>And every year were they sworn at the high feast of Pentecost. Explicit the Wedding of King Arthur. Sequitur quartus liber.
<p/>How Merlin was assotted and doted on one of the ladies of the lake, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) was shut in a rock under a stone and there died.
<p/>SO after these quests of Sir Gawaine, Sir Tor, and King Pellinore, it fell so that Merlin fell in a dotage on the damosel that King Pellinore brought to court, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) was one of the damosels of the lake, that hight Nimue.
<p/>And ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) made Merlin good cheer till she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) had learned of him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) all manner thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) desired; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) was assotted upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) might not be from her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>).
<p/>So on a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) told King Arthur that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) should not dure long, but for all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) crafts he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) should be put in the earth quick.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) told the king many things that should befall, but always he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) warned the king to keep well his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sword and the scabbard, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) how the sword and the scabbard should be stolen by a woman from him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) most trusted.
<p/>BOOK IV. CHAPTER I. But Merlin would let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) have no rest, but always he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) would be with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) told King Arthur that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>),--Yet
<p/>Ah, said the king, since ye know of your adventure, purvey for it, and put away by your crafts that misadventure.
<p/>had ye liefer than all your lands to have me again. Nay, said Merlin, it will not be; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) departed from the king.
<p/>And ofttimes Merlin would have had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) privily away by his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) subtle crafts; then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) to swear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) should never do none enchantment upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) would have his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) will.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) sware; so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Merlin went over the sea unto the land of Benwick, whereas King Ban was king that had great war against King Claudas, and there Merlin spake with King Ban's wife, a fair lady and a good, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name was Elaine, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) saw young Launcelot.
<p/>There the queen made great sorrow for the mortal war that King Claudas made on her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) lord and on her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) lands.
<p/>Take none heaviness, said Merlin, for this same child within this twenty year shall revenge you on King Claudas, that all Christendom shall speak of it; and this same child shall be the most man of worship of the world, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first name is Galahad, that know
<p/>And within a while the Damosel of the Lake departed, and Merlin went with her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) evermore wheresomever she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) went. I well, said Merlin, and since ye have confirmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) Launcelot.
<p/>That is truth, said the queen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) first name was Galahad. O Merlin, said the queen, shall I live to see my son such a man of prowess?
<p/>And so, soon after, the lady and Merlin departed, and by the way Merlin showed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) many wonders, and came into Cornwall.
<p/>And always Merlin lay about the lady to have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) maidenhood, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was ever passing weary of him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>), and fain would have been delivered of him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was afeard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) was a devil's son, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not beskift him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) by no mean.
<p/>And so on a time it happed that Merlin showed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in a rock whereas was a great wonder, and wrought by enchantment
<p/>Yea, lady, on my peril ye shall see it, and live many winters after. , that went under a great stone.
<p/>So by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) subtle working she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made Merlin to go under that stone to let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wit of the marvels there; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wrought so there for him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) came never out for all the craft he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) could do.
<p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) departed and left Merlin. CHAPTER II. How five kings came into this land to war against King Arthur, and
<p/>AND as King Arthur rode to Camelot, and held there a great feast with mirth and joy, so soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) returned unto Cardoile, and there came unto Arthur new tidings that the king of Denmark, and the king of Ireland that was his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) brother, and the king of the Vale, and the king of Soleise, and the king of the Isle of Longtains, all these five kings with a great host were entered into the land of King Arthur, and burnt and slew clean afore them, both cities and castles, that it was pity to hear.
<p/>what counsel Arthur had against them. Alas, said Arthur, yet had I never rest one month since I was crowned king of this land.
<p/>Now shall I never rest till I meet with those kings in a fair field, that I make mine avow; for my true liege people shall not be destroyed in my default, go with me who will, and abide who that will.
<p/>Then the king let write unto King Pellinore, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) in all haste to make him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ready with such people as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might lightliest rear and hie him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) after in all haste.
<p/>All the barons were privily wroth that the king would depart so suddenly; but the king by no mean would abide, but made writing unto them that were not there, and bade them hie after him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), such as were not at that time in the court.
<p/>Then the king came to Queen Guenever, and said, Lady, make you ready, for ye shall go with me, for I may not long miss you; ye shall cause me to be the more hardy, what adventure so befall me; I will not wit my lady to be in no jeopardy.
<p/>So on the morn the king and the queen departed with such fellowship as they had, and came into the north, into a forest beside Humber, and there lodged them.
<p/>When the word and tiding came unto the five kings above said, that Arthur was beside Humber in a forest, there was a knight, brother unto one of the five kings, that gave them this counsel:
<p/>Ye know well that Sir Arthur hath the flower of chivalry of the world with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), as it is proved by the great battle he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did with the eleven kings; and therefore hie unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) night and day till
<p/>Sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), I am at your commandment, and shall be ready what time so ye be ready. that we be nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
<p/>, for the longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tarrieth the bigger he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is, and we ever the weaker; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is so courageous of himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is come to the field with little people, and therefore let us set upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) or day
<p/>How King Arthur had ado with them and overthrew them, and slew the five kings and made the remnant to flee.
<p/>UNTO this counsel these five kings assented, and so they passed forth with their host through North Wales, and came upon Arthur by night, and set upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) host as the king and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knights were in their pavilions.
<p/>and we shall slay down; of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knights there shall none escape. CHAPTER III. King Arthur was unarmed, and had laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to rest with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) Queen Guenever.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Kay, it is not good we be unarmed. We shall have no need, said Sir Gawaine and Sir Griflet, that lay in a little pavilion by the king.
<p/>With that they heard a great noise, and many cried, Treason, treason! Alas, said King Arthur, we be betrayed! Unto arms, fellows, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cried.
<p/>Then came there a wounded knight unto the king, and said, Sir, save yourself and my lady the queen, for our host is destroyed, and much people of ours slain.
<p/>So anon the king and the queen and the three knights took their horses, and rode toward Humber to pass over it, and the water was so rough that they were afraid to pass over.
<p/>Now may ye choose, said King Arthur, whether ye will abide and take the adventure on this side, for an ye be taken they will slay you.
<p/>It were me liefer, said the queen, to die in the water than to fall in your enemies' hands and there be slain.
<p/>And as they stood so talking, Sir Kay saw the five kings coming on horseback by themselves alone, with their spears in their hands even toward them.
<p/>So they were armed anon at all points. Lo, said Sir Kay, yonder be the five kings; let us go to them and match them.
<p/>That were folly, said Sir Gawaine, for we are but three and they be five. That is truth, said Sir Griflet.
<p/>No force, said Sir Kay, I will undertake for two of them, and then may ye three undertake for the other three.
<p/>And therewithal, Sir Kay let his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse run as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) might, and struck one of them through the shield and the body a fathom, that the king fell to the earth stark dead.
<p/>And therewithal King Arthur ran to another, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) through the body with a spear, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fell to the earth dead
<p/>That saw Sir Gawaine, and ran unto another king so hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) through the body. Then Sir Griflet ran unto the fourth king, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) such a fall that his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) neck brake.
<p/>Anon Sir Kay ran unto the fifth king, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) so hard on the helm that the stroke clave the helm and the head to the earth.
<p/>That was well stricken, said King Arthur, and worshipfully hast thou holden thy promise, therefore I shall honour thee while that I live.
<p/>And therewithal they set the queen in a barge into Humber; but always Queen Guenever praised Sir Kay for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) deeds, and said, What lady that ye love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) love you not again she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were greatly to blame; and among ladies, said the queen, I shall bear your noble fame, for ye spake a great word, and fulfilled it worshipfully.
<p/>Then the king and the three knights rode into the forest, for there they supposed to hear of them that were escaped; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) found the most part of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) people, and told them all how the five kings were dead.
<p/>And therefore let us hold us together till it be day, and when their host have espied that their chieftains be slain, they will make such dole that they shall no more help themselves.
<p/>And right so as the king said, so it was; for when they found the five kings dead, they made such dole that they fell from their horses.
<p/>Therewithal came King Arthur but with a few people, and slew on the left hand and on the right hand, that well-nigh there escaped no man, but all were slain to the number thirty thousand.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sent for the queen, and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was come, and she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) made great joy of the overcoming of that battle.
<p/>And therewith the queen departed. And when the battle was all ended, the king kneeled down and thanked God meekly. CHAPTER IV.
<p/>THEREWITHAL came one to King Arthur, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) that King Pellinore was within three mile with a great host; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) said, Go unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>), and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) understand how we have sped.
<p/>So within a while King Pellinore came with a great host, and saluted the people and the king, and there was great joy made on every side.
<p/>Then the king let search how much people of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) party there was slain; and there were found but little past two hundred men slain and eight knights of the Table Round in their pavilions.
<p/>Then the king let rear and devise in the same place whereat the battle was done a fair abbey, and endowed it with great livelihood, and let it call the Abbey of La Beale Adventure.
<p/>But when some of them came into their countries, whereof the five kings were kings, and told them how they were slain, there was made great dole.
<p/>And all King Arthur's enemies, as the King of North Wales, and the kings of the North, -LSB-when they-RSB- wist of the battle, they were passing heavy.
<p/>How the battle was finished or he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came, and how King Arthur founded an abbey where the battle was. And so the king returned unto Camelot in haste.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was come to Camelot he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) called King Pellinore unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and said, Ye understand well that we have lost eight knights of the best of the Table Round, and by your advice we will choose eight again of the best we may find in this court.
<p/>Sir, said Pellinore, I shall counsel you after my conceit the best: there are in your court full noble knights both of old and young; and therefore by mine advice ye shall choose half of the old and half of the young.
<p/>Sir, said King Pellinore, meseemeth that King Uriens that hath wedded your sister Morgan le Fay, and the King of the Lake, and Sir Hervise de Revel, a noble knight, and Sir Galagars, the fourth.
<p/>Which be the old? said King Arthur. This is well devised, said King Arthur, and right so shall it be. Now, which are the four young knights? said Arthur.
<p/>Sir, said Pellinore, the first is Sir Gawaine, your nephew, that is as good a knight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) time as any is in this land; and
<p/>the second as meseemeth best is Sir Griflet le Fise de Dieu, that is a good knight and full desirous in arms, and who may see him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) live
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall prove a good knight; and the third as meseemeth is well to be one of the knights of the Round Table, Sir Kay the Seneschal, for many times he (<font color='blue'><b>Seneschal</b></font>) hath done full worshipfully, and now at your last battle he (<font color='blue'><b>Seneschal</b></font>) did full honourably for to undertake to slay two kings.
<p/>By my head, said Arthur, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is best worth to be a knight of the Round Table of any that ye have rehearsed, an he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had done no more prowess in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) life days.
<p/>NOW, said King Pellinore, I shall put to you two knights, and ye shall choose which is most worthy, that is Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Tor, my son.
<p/>But because Sir Tor is my son I may not praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>), but else, an he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) were not my son, I durst say that of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) age there is not in this land a better knight than he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is, nor of better conditions and loath to do any wrong, and loath to take any wrong.
<p/>CHAPTER V. How Sir Tor was made knight of the Round Table, and how Bagdemagus was displeased. By my head, said Arthur, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is a passing good knight as any ye spake of this day, that wot
<p/>I well, said the king; for I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) proved, but he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) saith little and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) doth much more, for I know none in all this court an he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) were as well born on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mother's side as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is on your side
<p/>, that is like him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of prowess and of might: and therefore I will have him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) at this time, and leave Sir Bagdemagus till another time.
<p/>So when they were so chosen by the assent of all the barons, so were there found in their sieges every knights' names that here are rehearsed, and so were they set in their sieges;
<p/>whereof Sir Bagdemagus was wonderly wroth, that Sir Tor was advanced afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>), and therefore suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) departed from the court, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) squire with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>), and rode long in a forest till they came to a cross, and there alighted and said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) prayers devoutly.
<p/>The meanwhile his (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) squire found written upon the cross, that Bagdemagus should never return unto the court again, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tor</b></font>) had won a knight's body of the Round Table, body for body.
<p/>So, sir, said the squire, here I find writing of you , therefore I rede you return again to the court.
<p/>That shall I never, said Bagdemagus, till men speak of me great worship, and that I be worthy to be a knight of the Round Table.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode forth, and there by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) found a branch of an holy herb that was the sign of the Sangreal, and no knight found such tokens
<p/>So, as Sir Bagdemagus rode to see many adventures, it happed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) to come to the rock whereas the Lady of the Lake had put Merlin under the stone, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) make great dole; whereof Sir Bagdemagus would have holpen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>), and went unto the great stone, and it was so heavy that an hundred men might not lift it up.
<p/>When Merlin wist he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) was there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) bade leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) labour, for all was in vain, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) might never be holpen but by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) that put him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) there.
<p/>And so Bagdemagus departed and did many adventures, and proved after a full good knight, and came again to the court and was made knight of the Round Table.
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) were a good liver. So on the morn there fell new tidings and other adventures. CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul, chased an hart, and of their marvellous adventures.
<p/>THEN it befell that Arthur and many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights rode a-hunting into a great forest, and it happed King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul, followed a great hart, for they three were well horsed, and so they chased so fast that within a while they three were then ten mile from their fellowship.
<p/>And at the last they chased so sore that they slew their horses underneath them. Then were they all three on foot, and ever they saw the hart afore them passing weary and enbushed.
<p/>What will we do? said King Arthur, we are hard bestead. Let us go on foot, said King Uriens, till we may meet with some lodging.
<p/>Then were they ware of the hart that lay on a great water bank, and a brachet biting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Uriens</b></font>) throat, and more other hounds came after.
<p/>Then the king looked about the world, and saw afore him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) in a great water a little ship, all apparelled with silk down to the water, and the ship came right unto them and landed on the sands.
<p/>Then King Arthur blew the prise and dight the hart. Then Arthur went to the bank and looked in, and saw none earthly creature therein.
<p/>Sirs, said the king, come thence, and let us see what is in this ship. So they went in all three, and found it richly behanged with cloth of silk.
<p/>By then it was dark night, and there suddenly were about them an hundred torches set upon all the sides of the ship boards, and it gave great light; and therewithal there came out twelve fair damosels and saluted King Arthur on their knees, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) name, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was right welcome, and such cheer as they had he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) should have of the best.
<p/>they led the king and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) two fellows into a fair chamber, and there was a cloth laid, richly beseen of all that longed unto a table, and there were they served of all wines and meats that they could think; of that the king had great marvel, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fared never better in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life as for one supper.
<p/>And so when they had supped at their leisure, King Arthur was led into a chamber, a richer beseen chamber saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) never none, and so was King Uriens served, and led into such another chamber, and Sir Accolon was led into the third chamber passing richly and well beseen; and so they were laid in their beds easily.
<p/>The king thanked them fair. Therewithal And anon they fell asleep, and slept marvellously sore all the night. And on the morrow King Uriens was in Camelot abed in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wife's arms, Morgan le Fay.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) awoke he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had great marvel, how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came there, for on the even afore he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was two days' journey from Camelot.
<p/>And when King Arthur awoke he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) found himself in a dark prison, hearing about him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) many complaints of woful knights. CHAPTER VII.
<p/>How Arthur took upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to fight to be delivered out of prison, and also for to deliver twenty knights that were in prison.
<p/>We be here twenty knights, prisoners, said they, and some of us have lain here seven year, and some more and some less.
<p/>We shall tell you, said the knights; this lord of this castle, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) name is Sir Damas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is the falsest knight that liveth, and full of treason, and a very coward as any liveth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) hath a younger brother, a good knight of prowess, his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) name is Sir Ontzlake; and this traitor Damas, the elder brother will give him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) no part of his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) livelihood, but as Sir Ontzlake keepeth thorough prowess of his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) hands, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) keepeth from him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)
<p/>WHAT are ye that so complain? said King Arthur. For what cause? said Arthur. a full fair manor and a rich, and therein Sir Ontzlake dwelleth worshipfully, and is well beloved of all people.
<p/>And this Sir Damas, our master is as evil beloved, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) is without mercy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) is a coward, and great war hath
<p/>been betwixt them both, but Ontzlake hath ever the better, and ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) proffereth Sir Damas to fight for the livelihood, body for body, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) will not do; other-else to find a knight to fight for him (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>).
<p/>Unto that Sir Damas had granted to find a knight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) is so evil beloved and hated, that there is never a knight will fight for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>a knight would fight for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath daily lain await with many knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and taken all the knights in this country to see and espy their adventures, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath taken them by force and brought them to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) prison.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) took us separately as we rode on our adventures, and many good knights have died in this prison for hunger, to the number of eighteen knights; and if any of us all that here is, or hath been, would have foughten with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brother Ontzlake, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have delivered us, but for because this Damas is so false and so full of treason we would never fight for him (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) to die for it.
<p/>And when Damas saw this, that there was never And we be so lean for hunger that unnethe we may stand on our feet.
<p/>God deliver you, for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercy, said Arthur. Anon, therewithal there came a damosel unto Arthur, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), What cheer?
<p/>Sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), an ye will fight for my lord, ye shall be delivered out of prison, and else ye escape never the life.
<p/>had I liefer to fight with a knight than to die in prison; with this, said Arthur, I may be delivered and all these prisoners, I will do the battle.
<p/>I cannot say, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Now, said Arthur, that is hard, yet Yes, said the damosel. I am ready, said Arthur, an
<p/>I had horse and armour. Ye shall lack none, said the damosel. Meseemeth, damosel, I should have seen you in the court of Arthur.
<p/>Nay said the damosel, I came never there, I am the lord's daughter of this castle. Yet was she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) false, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was one of the damosels of Morgan le Fay.
<p/>Anon she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went unto Sir Damas, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) would do battle for him (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) sent for Arthur.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was well coloured, and well made of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) limbs, that all knights that saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said it were pity that such a knight should die in prison.
<p/>So Sir Damas and he (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) were agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) should fight for him (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) upon this covenant, that all other knights should be delivered; and unto that was Sir Damas sworn unto Arthur, and also to do the battle to the uttermost.
<p/>And with that all the twenty knights were brought out of the dark prison into the hall, and delivered, and so they all abode to see the battle.
<p/>NOW turn we unto Accolon of Gaul, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) awoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) found himself by a deep well-side, within half a foot, in great peril of death.
<p/>And there came out of that fountain a pipe of silver, and out of that pipe ran water all on high in a stone of marble.
<p/>When Sir Accolon saw this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) and said, Jesus save my lord King Arthur, and King Uriens, for these damosels in this ship have betrayed us, they were devils and no women; and if I may escape this misadventure, I shall destroy all where I may find these false damosels that use enchantments.
<p/>Right with that there came a dwarf with a great mouth and a flat nose, and saluted Sir Accolon, and said how he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) came from Queen Morgan le Fay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) greeteth you well, and biddeth you be of strong heart, for ye shall fight to morrow with a knight at the hour of prime, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hath sent you here Excalibur, Arthur's sword, and the scabbard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) biddeth you as ye love her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), that ye do the battle to the uttermost, without any mercy, like as ye had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) when ye spake together in privity; and what damosel that bringeth her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) the knight's head, which ye shall fight withal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) a queen.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII. How Accolon found himself by a well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) took upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to do battle against Arthur. Now I understand you well, said Accolon, I shall hold that I have promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) now
<p/>Then Accolon took him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arms and said, Recommend me unto my lady queen, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) all shall be done that I have promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), and else I will die for it.
<p/>I have the sword: when saw ye my lady Queen Morgan le Fay? Right late, said the dwarf. Now I suppose, said Accolon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hath made all these crafts and enchantments for this battle.
<p/>so there came a knight and a lady with six squires, and saluted Accolon, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) for to arise, and come and rest him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) manor.
<p/>And so Accolon mounted upon a void horse, and went with the knight unto a fair manor by a priory, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had passing good cheer.
<p/>Then Sir Damas sent unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) brother Sir Ontzlake, and bade make him (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) ready by to-morn at the hour of prime, and to be in the field to fight with a good knight, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had found a good knight that was ready to do battle at all points.
<p/>When this word came unto Sir Ontzlake he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was passing heavy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was wounded a little to-fore through both his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) thighs with a spear, and made great dole; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was wounded, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have taken the battle on hand.
<p/>So it happed at that time, by the means of Morgan le Fay, Accolon was with Sir Ontzlake lodged; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) heard of that battle, and how Ontzlake was wounded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) would fight for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>).
<p/>Because Morgan le Fay had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) Excalibur and the sheath for to fight with the knight on the morn: this was the cause Sir Accolon took the battle on hand.
<p/>Then Sir Ontzlake was passing glad, and thanked Sir Accolon with all his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would do so much for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And therewithal Sir Ontzlake sent word unto his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brother Sir Damas, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had a knight that for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should be ready in the field by the hour of prime.
<p/>So on the morn Sir Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked Sir Damas, When shall we to the field?
<p/>And so Arthur heard a mass, and when mass was done there came a squire on a great horse, and asked Sir Damas if his (<font color='blue'><b>Damas</b></font>) knight were ready, for our knight is ready in the field.
<p/>Then Sir Arthur mounted upon horseback, and there were all the knights and commons of that country; and so by all advices there were chosen twelve good men of the country for to wait upon the two knights.
<p/>And right as Arthur was on horseback there came a damosel from Morgan le Fay, and brought unto Sir Arthur a sword like unto Excalibur, and the scabbard, and said unto Arthur, Morgan le Fay sendeth here your sword for great love.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>knights</b></font>), and weened it had been so, but she (<font color='blue'><b>knights</b></font>) was false, for the sword and the scabbard was counterfeit, and brittle, and false.
<p/>Ye may well believe it, said the dwarf. Right Sir, said Sir Damas, ye shall hear mass. CHAPTER IX. Of the battle between King Arthur and Accolon.
<p/>AND then they dressed them on both parties of the field, and let their horses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of the shield with their spear-heads, that both horse and man went to the earth; and then they started up both, and pulled out their swords.
<p/>The meanwhile that they were thus at the battle, came the Damosel of the Lake into the field, that put Merlin under the stone; and she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) came thither for love of King Arthur, for she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) knew how Morgan le Fay had so ordained that King Arthur should have been slain that day, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) came to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) life.
<p/>And so they went eagerly to the battle, and gave many great strokes, but always Arthur's sword bit not like Accolon's sword; but for the most part, every stroke that Accolon gave he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wounded sore Arthur, that it was marvel he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stood, and always his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) blood fell from him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fast.
<p/>When Arthur beheld the ground so sore be-bled he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was dismayed, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) deemed treason that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword was changed; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword bit not steel as it was wont to do
<p/>, therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dreaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sore to be dead, for ever him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) seemed that the sword in Accolon's hand was Excalibur, for at every stroke that Accolon struck he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) drew blood on Arthur.
<p/>Now, knight, said Accolon unto Arthur, keep thee well from me; but Arthur answered not again, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) such a buffet on the helm that it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to stoop, nigh falling down to the earth.
<p/>Then Sir Accolon withdrew him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) a little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and smote Sir Arthur such a buffet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fell nigh to the earth.
<p/>Then were they wroth both, and gave each other many sore strokes, but always Sir Arthur lost so much blood that it was marvel he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) feet, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was so full of knighthood that knightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) endured the pain.
<p/>And Sir Accolon lost not a deal of blood, therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) waxed passing light, and Sir Arthur was passing feeble, and weened verily to have died; but for all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made countenance as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might endure, and held Accolon as short as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might.
<p/>But all men that beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said they saw never knight fight so well as Arthur did considering the blood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bled.
<p/>But Accolon was so bold because of Excalibur that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) waxed passing hardy. So was all the people sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), but the two brethren would not accord.
<p/>Then always they fought together as fierce knights, and Sir Arthur withdrew him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) a little for to rest him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and Sir Accolon called him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to battle and said, It is no time for me to suffer thee to rest.
<p/>And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came fiercely upon Arthur, and Sir Arthur was wroth for the blood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had lost, and smote Accolon on high upon the helm, so mightily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nigh to fall to the earth; and therewith Arthur's sword brast at the cross, and fell in the grass among the blood, and the pommel and the sure handles he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands.
<p/>When Sir Arthur saw that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was in great fear to die, but always he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shield and lost no ground, nor bated no cheer.
<p/>How King Arthur's sword that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fought with brake, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) recovered of Accolon his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own sword Excalibur, and overcame his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) enemy.
<p/>THEN Sir Accolon began with words of treason, and said, Knight, thou art overcome, and mayst not endure, and also thou art weaponless, and
<p/>thou hast lost much of thy blood, and I am full loath to slay thee, therefore yield thee to me as recreant.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Arthur, I may not so, for I have promised to do the battle to the uttermost by the faith of my body, while me lasteth the life, and therefore I had liefer to die with honour than to live with shame; and if it were possible for me to die an hundred times, I had liefer to die so oft than yield me to thee;
<p/>for though I lack weapon, I shall lack no worship, and if thou slay me weaponless that shall be thy shame.
<p/>Well, said Accolon, as for the shame I will not spare, now keep thee from me, for thou art but a dead man.
<p/>And therewith Accolon gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) such a stroke that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell nigh to the earth, and would have had Arthur to have cried him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mercy.
<p/>But Sir Arthur pressed unto Accolon with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shield, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with the pommel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand such a buffet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went three strides aback.
<p/>When the Damosel of the Lake beheld Arthur, how full of prowess his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) body was, and the false treason that was wrought for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) slain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had great pity that so good a knight and such a man of worship should so be destroyed.
<p/>And at the next stroke Sir Accolon struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) such a stroke that by the damosel's enchantment the sword Excalibur fell out of Accolon's hand to the earth.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Arthur lightly leapt to it, and gat it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand, and forthwithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knew that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword Excalibur, and said, Thou hast been from me all too long, and much damage hast thou done me; and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) espied the scabbard hanging by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) side, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sterte to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and pulled the scabbard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and threw it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might throw it.
<p/>O knight, said Arthur, this day hast thou done me great damage with this sword; now are ye come unto your death, for I shall not warrant you but ye shall as well be rewarded with this sword, or ever we depart, as thou hast rewarded me; for much pain have ye made me to endure, and much blood have I lost.
<p/>And therewith Sir Arthur rushed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to the earth, and then rushed off his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) helm, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) such a buffet on the head that the blood came out at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ears, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nose, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>CHAPTER X. Now will I slay thee, said Arthur. Slay me ye may well, said Accolon, an it please you, for ye are the best knight that ever I found, and
<p/>But for I promised to do this battle, said Accolon, to the uttermost, and never to be recreant while I lived, therefore shall I never yield me with my mouth, but God do with my body what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will.
<p/>I see well that God is with you. Then Sir Arthur remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should have seen this knight.
<p/>Now tell me, said Arthur, or I will slay thee, of what country art thou, and of what court? Sir Knight, said Sir Accolon, I am of the court of King Arthur, and my name is Accolon of Gaul.
<p/>Then was Arthur more dismayed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was beforehand; for then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sister Morgan le Fay, and of the enchantment of the ship.
<p/>O sir knight, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), I pray you tell me who gave you this sword, and by whom ye had it.
<p/>CHAPTER XI. How Accolon confessed the treason of Morgan le Fay, King Arthur's sister, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would have done slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>THEN Sir Accolon bethought him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and said, Woe worth this sword, for by it have I got my death. It may well be, said the king.
<p/>Now, sir, said Accolon, I will tell you; this sword hath been in my keeping the most part of this twelvemonth; and Morgan le Fay, King Uriens' wife, sent it me yesterday by a dwarf, to this intent, that I should slay King Arthur, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother.
<p/>For ye shall understand King Arthur is the man in the world that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) most hateth, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is most of worship and of prowess of any of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) blood; also she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loveth me out of measure as paramour, and I her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might bring about to slay Arthur by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crafts, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would slay her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband King Uriens lightly, and
<p/>then had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) me devised to be king in this land, and so to reign, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be my queen; but that is now done, said Accolon, for I am sure of my death.
<p/>Well, said Sir Arthur, I feel by you ye would have been king in this land. It had been great damage to have destroyed your lord, said Arthur.
<p/>It is truth, said Accolon, but now I have told you truth, wherefore I pray you tell me of whence ye are, and of what court?
<p/>O Accolon, said King Arthur, now I let thee wit that I am King Arthur, to whom thou hast done great damage.
<p/>When Accolon heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cried aloud, Fair, sweet lord, have mercy on me, for I knew not you. O Sir Accolon, said King Arthur, mercy shalt thou have, because I feel by thy words at this time
<p/>thou knewest not my person; but I understand well by thy words that thou hast agreed to the death of my person, and therefore thou art a traitor; but I wite thee the less, for my sister Morgan le Fay by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) false crafts made thee to agree and consent to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) false lusts, but I shall be sore avenged upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) an I live, that all Christendom shall speak of it; God knoweth I have honoured her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and worshipped her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) more than all my kin, and more have I trusted her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) than mine own wife and all my kin after.
<p/>Then Sir Arthur called the keepers of the field, and said, Sirs, come hither, for here are we two knights that have fought unto a great damage unto us both, and like each one of us to have slain other, if it had happed so; and had any of us known other, here had been no battle, nor stroke stricken.
<p/>Then all aloud cried Accolon unto all the knights and men that were then there gathered together, and said to them in this manner, O lords, this noble knight that I have fought withal, the which me sore repenteth, is the most man of prowess, of manhood, and of worship in the world, for it is himself King Arthur, our alther liege lord, and with mishap and with misadventure have I done this battle with the king and lord that I am holden withal.
<p/>CHAPTER XII. How Arthur accorded the two brethren, and delivered the twenty knights, and how Sir Accolon died. THEN all the people fell down on their knees and cried King Arthur mercy.
<p/>Mercy shall ye have, said Arthur: here may ye see what adventures befall ofttime of errant knights, how that I have fought with a knight of mine own unto my great damage and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) both.
<p/>, ye shall understand the opinion betwixt you two brethren: As to thee, Sir Damas, for whom I have been champion and won the field of this knight, yet will I judge because ye, Sir Damas, are called an orgulous knight, and full of villainy, and not worth of prowess your deeds, therefore I will that ye give unto your brother all the whole manor with the appurtenance, under this form, that Sir Ontzlake hold the manor of you, and yearly to give you a palfrey to ride upon, for that will become you better to ride on than upon a courser.
<p/>Also I charge thee, Sir Damas, upon pain of death, that thou never distress no knights errant that ride on their adventure.
<p/>And also that thou restore these twenty knights that thou hast long kept prisoners, of all their harness, that they be content for; and if any of them come to my court and complain of thee, by my head thou shalt die therefore.
<p/>Also, Sir Ontzlake, as to you, because ye are named a good knight, and full of prowess, and true and gentle in all your deeds, this shall be your charge I will give you, that in all goodly haste ye come unto me and my court, and ye shall be a knight of mine, and if your deeds be thereafter I shall so prefer you, by the grace of God, that ye shall in short time be in ease for to live as worshipfully as your brother Sir Damas.
<p/>God thank your largeness of your goodness and of your bounty, I shall be from henceforward at all times at your commandment; for, sir, said Sir Ontzlake, as God would, as I was hurt but late with an adventurous knight through both my thighs, that grieved me sore, and else had I done this battle with you.
<p/>But, sirs, because I am sore hurt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) both, and I had great need of a little rest God would, said Arthur, it had been so, for then had not I been hurt as I am.
<p/>I shall tell you the cause why: for I had not been hurt as I am, had it not been mine own sword, that was stolen from me by treason; and this battle was ordained aforehand to have slain me, and so it was brought to the purpose by false treason, and by false enchantment.
<p/>Alas, said Sir Ontzlake, that is great pity that ever so noble a man as ye are of your deeds and prowess, that any man or woman might find in their hearts to work any treason against you.
<p/>I shall reward them, said Arthur, in short time, by the grace of God. Now, tell me, said Arthur, how far am I from Camelot?
<p/>Sir, ye are two days' journey therefrom. I would fain be at some place of worship, said Sir Arthur, that I might rest me.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Ontzlake, hereby is a rich abbey of your elders' foundation, of nuns, but three miles hence. So the king took his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) leave of all the people, and mounted upon horseback, and Sir Accolon with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>And when they were come to the abbey, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) let fetch leeches and search his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wounds and Accolon's both; but Sir Accolon died within four days, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had bled so much blood that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might not live, but King Arthur was well recovered.
<p/>So when Accolon was dead he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) let send him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) on an horse-bier with six knights unto Camelot, and said: Bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to my sister Morgan le Fay, and say that I send her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) to a present, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) I have my sword Excalibur and the scabbard; so they departed with the body.
<p/>CHAPTER XIII. How Morgan would have slain Sir Uriens her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband, and how Sir Uwaine her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) son saved him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). THE meanwhile Morgan le Fay had weened King Arthur had been dead.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) called unto her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a maiden of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) counsel, and said, Go fetch me my lord's sword, for I saw never better time to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) than now.
<p/>So on a day she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) espied King Uriens lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) bed sleeping. O madam, said the damosel, an ye slay my lord
<p/>Care not you, said Morgan le Fay, for now I see my time in the which it is best to do it, and therefore hie thee fast and fetch me the sword.
<p/>Then the damosel departed, and found Sir Uwaine sleeping upon a bed in another chamber, so she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) went unto Sir Uwaine, and awaked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>), and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>), Arise, and wait on my lady your mother, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will slay the king your father sleeping in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bed, for I go to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sword.
<p/>Anon the damosel brought Morgan the sword with quaking hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lightly took the sword, and pulled it out, and went boldly unto the bed's side, and awaited how and where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) best.
<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lifted up the sword to smite, Sir Uwaine leapt unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) mother, and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by the hand, and said, Ah, fiend, what wilt thou do?
<p/>ye can never escape. Well, said Sir Uwaine, go on your way, and let me deal. An thou wert not my mother, with this sword I should smite off thy head.
<p/>Ah, said Sir Uwaine, men saith that Merlin was begotten of a devil, but I may say an earthly devil bare me.
<p/>O fair son, Uwaine, have mercy upon me, I was tempted with a devil, wherefore I cry thee mercy; I will never more do so; and save my worship and discover me not.
<p/>On this covenant, said Sir Uwaine, I will forgive it you, so ye will never be about to do such deeds.
<p/>How Queen Morgan le Fay made great sorrow for the death of Accolon, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) stole away the scabbard from Arthur.
<p/>THEN came tidings unto Morgan le Fay that Accolon was dead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) body brought unto the church, and how King Arthur had his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword again.
<p/>Nay, son, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), and that I make you assurance. CHAPTER XIV. But when Queen Morgan wist that Accolon was dead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was so sorrowful
<p/>that near her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) heart to-brast. But because she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) would not it were known, outward she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) countenance, and made no semblant of sorrow.
<p/>But well she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) wist an she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) abode till her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) brother Arthur came thither, there should no gold go for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) life.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) went unto Queen Guenever, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) leave to ride into the country. Ye may abide, said Queen Guenever, till your brother the king come home.
<p/>I may not, said Morgan le Fay, for I have such hasty tidings, that I may not tarry. Well, said Guenever, ye may depart when ye will.
<p/>So early on the morn, or it was day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) horse and rode all that day and most part of the night, and on the morn by noon she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) came to the same abbey of nuns whereas lay King Arthur; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) asked where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was.
<p/>And they answered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bed to sleep, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had had but little rest these three nights.
<p/>Well, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>), I charge you that none of you awake him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) till I do, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) alighted off her (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) horse, and thought for to steal away Excalibur his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) went straight unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) chamber, and
<p/>no man durst disobey her (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) commandment, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) found Arthur asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bed, and Excalibur in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) right hand naked.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) was passing heavy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) might not come by the sword without she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) had awaked him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) wist well she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) had been dead.
<p/>When the king awoke and missed his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) scabbard, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was wroth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) asked who had been there, and they said his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sister, Queen Morgan had been there, and had put the scabbard under her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mantle and was gone.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took the scabbard and went her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) way on horseback. Alas, said Arthur, falsely ye have watched me. Sir, said they all, we durst not disobey your sister's commandment.
<p/>Ah, said the king, let fetch the best horse may be found, and bid Sir Ontzlake arm him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) in all haste, and take another good horse and ride with me.
<p/>So anon the king and Ontzlake were well armed, and rode after this lady, and so they came by a cross and found a cowherd, and they asked the poor man if there came any lady riding that way.
<p/>Sir, said this poor man, right late came a lady riding with a forty horses, and to yonder forest she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode.
<p/>Then they spurred their horses, and followed fast, and within a while Arthur had a sight of Morgan le Fay; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) chased as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) espied him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) following her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode a greater pace through the forest till she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to a plain, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might not escape, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode unto a lake thereby, and said, Whatsoever come of me, my brother shall not have this scabbard.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) let throw the scabbard in the deepest of the water so it sank, for it was heavy of gold and precious stones.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode into a valley where many great stones were, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be overtaken, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shaped herself, horse and man, by enchantment unto a great marble stone.
<p/>Anon withal came Sir Arthur and Sir Ontzlake whereas the king might know his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) men, and one knight from another.
<p/>Ah, said the king, here may ye see the vengeance of God, and now am I sorry that this misadventure is befallen.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked for the scabbard, but it would not be found, so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) returned to the abbey where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came from.
<p/>So when Arthur was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) turned all into the likeliness as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and they were before, and said, Sirs, now may we go where we will.
<p/>CHAPTER XV. How Morgan le Fay saved a knight that should have been drowned, and how King Arthur returned home again.
<p/>Yea, said her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knights, right well, and that ye should have found an we might have stirred from one stead, for by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) armyvestal countenance he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would have caused us to have fled.
<p/>Anon after as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) rode she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) met a knight leading another knight on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse before him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), bound hand and foot, blindfold, to have drowned him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in a fountain.
<p/>THEN said Morgan, Saw ye Arthur, my brother? I believe you, said Morgan. When she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) saw this knight so bound, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>), What will ye do with that knight?
<p/>Lady, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), I will drown him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). For what cause? she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) asked. For I found him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) with my wife, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) shall have the same death anon.
<p/>That were pity, said Morgan le Fay. Now, what say ye, knight, is it truth that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saith of you? she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said to the knight that should be drowned.
<p/>Nay truly, madam, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saith not right on me. Of whence be ye, said Morgan le Fay, and of what country?
<p/>Ye say well, said she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), and for the love of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) ye shall be delivered, and ye shall have your adversary in the same case ye be in.
<p/>I am of the court of King Arthur, and my name is Manassen, cousin unto Accolon of Gaul. So Manassen was loosed and the other knight bound.
<p/>And anon Manassen unarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and armed himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) harness, and so mounted on horseback, and the knight afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and so threw him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) into the fountain and drowned him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that I rescued thee, not for the love of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) but for the love of Accolon, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) I fear him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) not while I can make me and them that be with me in likeness of stones; and let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wit I can do much more when I see my time.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode unto Morgan again, and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would anything unto King Arthur. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) departed into the country of Gore, and
<p/>When the king had well rested him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) at the abbey, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) rode unto Camelot, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) queen and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) barons right glad of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) coming.
<p/>And when they heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) strange adventures as is afore rehearsed, then all had marvel of the falsehood of Morgan le Fay; many knights wished her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) burnt.
<p/>there was she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) richly received, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) castles and towns passing strong, for always she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) dreaded much King Arthur. Then came Manassen to court and told the king of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) adventure.
<p/>Well, said the king, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) is a kind sister; I shall so be avenged on her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) an I live, that all Christendom shall speak of it.
<p/>So on the morn there came a damosel from Morgan to the king, and she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) the richest mantle that ever was seen in that court, for it was set as full of precious stones as one might stand by another, and there were the richest stones that ever the king saw.
<p/>And the damosel said, Your sister sendeth you this mantle, and desireth that ye should take this gift of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); and in what thing she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hath offended you, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will amend it at your own pleasure.
<p/>When the king beheld this mantle it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) much, but he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said but little. CHAPTER XVI. How the Damosel of the Lake saved King Arthur from mantle that should have burnt him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>WITH that came the Damosel of the Lake unto the king, and said, Sir, I must speak with you in privity.
<p/>Sir, said the damosel, put not on you this mantle till ye have seen more, and in no wise let it not come on you, nor on no knight of yours, till ye command the bringer thereof to put it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said unto the damosel that came from his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sister, Damosel, this mantle that ye have brought me, I will see it upon you.
<p/>Say on, said the king, what ye will. Well, said King Arthur, it shall be done as ye counsel me. Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, It will not beseem me to wear a king's garment.
<p/>By my head, said Arthur, ye shall wear it or it come on my back, or any man's that here is.
<p/>And so the king made it to be put upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and forth withal she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fell down dead, and never more spake word after and burnt to coals.
<p/>Then was the king wonderly wroth, more than he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was to-forehand, and said unto King Uriens, My sister, your wife, is alway about to betray me, and well I wot
<p/>either ye, or my nephew, your son, is of counsel with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to have me destroyed; but as for you, said the king to King Uriens,
<p/>I deem not greatly that ye be of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) counsel, for Accolon confessed to me by his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own mouth, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would have destroyed you as well as me
<p/>, therefore I hold you excused; but as for your son, Sir Uwaine, I hold him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) suspect, therefore I charge you put him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) out of my court.
<p/>And when Sir Gawaine wist that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) ready to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); and said, Whoso banisheth my cousin-germain shall banish me.
<p/>So they two departed, and rode into a great forest, and so they came to an abbey of monks, and there were well lodged.
<p/>But when the king wist that Sir Gawaine was departed from the court, there was made great sorrow among all the estates.
<p/>So Sir Uwaine was discharged. Now, said Gaheris, Gawaine's brother, we have lost two good knights for the love of one.
<p/>So on the morn they heard their masses in the abbey, and so they rode forth till that they came to a great forest.
<p/>Then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret -LSB-of-RSB- twelve fair damosels, and two knights armed on great horses, and the damosels went to and fro by a tree.
<p/>Sir Gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree, and ever as the damosels came by it they spit upon it, and some threw mire upon the shield.
<p/>And then was CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine met with twelve fair damosels, and how they complained on Sir Marhaus.
<p/>THEN Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked why they did that despite to the shield. Sir, said the damosels, we shall tell you.
<p/>There is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is a passing good man of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hands, but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hateth all ladies and gentlewomen, and therefore we do all this despite to the shield.
<p/>I shall say you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) hate you he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) hath some certain cause, and peradventure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) loveth in some other places ladies and gentlewomen, and to be loved again, an
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) be such a man of prowess as ye speak of. Now, what is his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) name? Sir, said they, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) name is Marhaus, the king's son of Ireland.
<p/>I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) well, said Sir Uwaine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) is a passing good knight as any is alive, for I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) once proved at a jousts where many knights were gathered, and
<p/>Ah! said Sir Gawaine, damosels, methinketh ye are to blame, for it is to suppose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) that hung that shield there
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) will not be long therefrom, and then may those knights match him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) on horseback, and that is more your worship than thus; for I will abide no longer to see a knight's shield dishonoured.
<p/>that time there might no man withstand him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And therewith Sir Uwaine and Gawaine departed a little from them, and then were they ware where Sir Marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward them.
<p/>And when the twelve damosels saw Sir Marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild, so that some of them fell by the way.
<p/>And so they ran together that the knight brake his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear on Marhaus, and Marhaus smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) so hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brake his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) neck and
<p/>Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield, and said on high, Sir Marhaus, defend thee. the horse's back.
<p/>That saw the other knight of the turret, and dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) toward Marhaus, and they met so eagerly together that the knight of the turret was soon smitten down, horse and man, stark dead.
<p/>AND then Sir Marhaus rode unto his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shield, and saw how it was defouled, and said, Of this despite I am a part avenged, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love that gave me this white shield I shall wear thee, and hang mine where thou wast; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hanged it about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck.
<p/>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Marhaus jousted with Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine, and overthrew them both. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) rode straight unto Sir Gawaine and to Sir Uwaine, and asked them what they did there?
<p/>Well, said Sir Marhaus, here am I ready, an adventurous knight that will fulfil any adventure that ye will desire; and so departed from them, to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) range.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) go, said Sir Uwaine unto Sir Gawaine, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) is a passing good knight as any is living; I would not by my will that any of us were matched with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>They answered him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that they came from King Arthur's court to see adventures. Nay, said Sir Gawaine, not so, it were shame to us
<p/>Well, said Sir Uwaine, I will assay him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) afore you, for I am more weaker than ye, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) smite me down then may ye revenge me.
<p/>So these two knights came together with great raundon, that Sir Uwaine smote Sir Marhaus that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) spear brast in pieces on the shield, and Sir Marhaus smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) so sore that horse and man he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) bare to the earth, and hurt Sir Uwaine on the left side.
<p/>Then Sir Marhaus turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse and rode toward Gawaine with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) spear, and when Sir Gawaine saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) shield, and they aventred their spears, and they came together with all the might of their horses, that either knight smote other so hard in midst of their shields, but Sir Gawaine's spear brake, but Sir Marhaus' spear held; and therewith Sir Gawaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse rushed down to the earth.
<p/>And lightly Sir Gawaine rose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) feet, and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sword, and dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and Sir Marhaus saw that, and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sword and began to come to Sir Gawaine on horseback.
<p/>were he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) not assayed, were he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) never so good a knight. Sir knight, said Sir Gawaine, alight on foot, or else I will slay thy horse.
<p/>Gramercy, said Sir Marhaus, of your gentleness ye teach me courtesy, for it is not for one knight to be on foot, and the other on horseback.
<p/>And therewith Sir Marhaus set his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear against a tree and alighted and tied his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse to a tree, and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield, and either came unto other eagerly, and smote together with their swords that their shields flew in cantels, and they bruised their helms and their hauberks, and wounded either other.
<p/>But Sir Gawaine from it passed nine of the clock waxed ever stronger and stronger, for then it came to the hour of noon, and thrice his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) might was increased.
<p/>And then when it was past noon, and when it drew toward evensong, Sir Gawaine's strength feebled, and waxed passing faint that unnethes
<p/>All this espied Sir Marhaus and had great wonder how his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) might increased, and so they wounded other passing sore. he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) might dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger.
<p/>Sir knight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well felt that ye are a passing good knight and a marvellous man of might as ever I felt any, while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and therefore it were pity to do you hurt, for I feel ye are passing feeble.
<p/>And therewith they took off their helms, and either kissed other, and there they swore together either to love other as brethren.
<p/>Ah, said Sir Gawaine, gentle knight, ye say the word that I should say. And Sir Marhaus prayed Sir Gawaine to lodge with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) that night.
<p/>And as they rode by the way, Sir knight, said Sir Gawaine, I have marvel that so valiant a man as ye be love no ladies nor damosels.
<p/>And so they took their horses, and rode toward Sir Marhaus' house. Sir, said Sir Marhaus, they name me wrongfully those that give me that name,
<p/>but well I wot it be the damosels of the turret that so name me, and other such as they be.
<p/>Now shall I tell you for what cause I hate them: for they be sorceresses and enchanters many of them, and be a knight never so good of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) body and full of prowess as man may be, they will make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a stark coward to have the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and this is the principal cause that I hate them; and to all good ladies and gentlewomen I owe my service as a knight ought to do.
<p/>As the book rehearseth in French, there were many knights that overmatched Sir Gawaine, for all the thrice might that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) had: Sir Launcelot de Lake, Sir Tristram, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Percivale, Sir Pelleas, and Sir Marhaus, these six knights had the better of Sir Gawaine.
<p/>Then within a little while they came to Sir Marhaus' place, which was in a little priory, and there they alighted, and ladies and damosels unarmed them, and hastily looked to their hurts, for they were all three hurt.
<p/>And so they had all three good lodging with Sir Marhaus, and good cheer; for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) wist that they were King Arthur's sister's sons he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) made them all the cheer that lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) power, and so they sojourned there a sennight, and were well eased of their wounds, and at the last departed.
<p/>Now, said Sir Marhaus, we will not depart so lightly, for I will bring you through the forest; and rode day by day well a seven days or they found any adventure.
<p/>At the last they came into a great forest, that was named the country and forest of Arroy, and the country of strange adventures.
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) found strange adventures; and so they rode, and came into a deep valley full of stones, and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was the head of the stream a fair fountain, and three damosels sitting thereby.
<p/>And then they rode to them, and either saluted other, and the eldest had a garland of gold about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was three score winter of age or more, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) hair was white under the garland.
<p/>In this country, said Sir Marhaus, came never knight since it was christened The second damosel was of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of gold about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) head.
<p/>The third damosel was but fifteen year of age, and a garland of flowers about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) head. When these knights had so beheld them, they asked them
<p/>We be here, said the damosels, for this cause: if we may see any errant knights, to teach them unto strange adventures; and ye be three knights that seek adventures, and we be three damosels, and therefore each one of you must choose one of us; and when ye have done so we will lead you unto three highways, and there each of you shall choose a way and his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) damosel with him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>).
<p/>And this day twelvemonth ye must meet here again, and God send you your lives, and thereto ye must plight your troth.
<p/>How Sir Marhaus, Sir Gawaine, and Sir Uwaine met three damosels, and each of them took one.-LSB-*1-RSB- -LSB-*1-RSB- Misnumbered xx. by Caxton.
<p/>the cause why they sat at that fountain? This is well said, said Sir Marhaus. CHAPTER XIX. NOW shall everych of us choose a damosel.
<p/>I shall tell you, said Sir Uwaine, I am the youngest and most weakest of you both, therefore I will have the eldest damosel, for she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hath seen much, and can best help me when I have need, for I have most need of help of you both.
<p/>Well, said Sir Gawaine, I thank you, for ye have left me the youngest and the fairest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is most liefest to me.
<p/>Then every damosel took her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knight by the reins of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bridle, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to the three ways, and there was their oath made to meet at the fountain that day twelvemonth an they were living, and so they kissed and departed, and each knight set his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady behind him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And Sir Uwaine took the way that lay west, and Sir Marhaus took the way that lay south, and Sir Gawaine took the way that lay north.
<p/>Now will we begin at Sir Gawaine, that held that way till that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) came unto a fair manor, where dwelled an old knight and a good householder, and there Sir Gawaine asked the knight if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) knew any adventures in that country.
<p/>Now, said Sir Marhaus, I will have the damosel of thirty winter age, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) falleth best to me. I shall show you some to-morn, said the old knight, and that marvellous.
<p/>So, on the morn they rode into the forest of adventures to a laund, and thereby they found a cross, and as they stood and hoved there came by them the fairest knight and the seemliest man that ever they saw, making the greatest dole that ever man made.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ware of Sir Gawaine, and saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and prayed God to send him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) much worship. As to that, said Sir Gawaine, gramercy; also I pray to God that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) send you honour and worship.
<p/>Ah, said the knight, I may lay that aside, for sorrow and shame cometh to me after worship. CHAPTER XX. How a knight and a dwarf strove for a lady.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) passed unto the one side of the laund; and on the other side saw Sir Gawaine ten knights that hoved still and made them ready with their shields and spears against that one knight that came by Sir Gawaine.
<p/>Then this one knight aventred a great spear, and one of the ten knights encountered with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), but this woful knight smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) so hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell over his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse's tail.
<p/>So this same dolorous knight served them all, that at the leastway he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) smote down horse and man, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did with one spear; and so when they were all ten on foot, they went to that one knight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) stood stone still, and suffered them to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) down off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse, and bound him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand and foot, and tied him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) under the horse's belly, and so led him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) with them.
<p/>O Jesu! said Sir Gawaine, this is a doleful sight, to see the yonder knight so to be entreated, and it seemeth by the knight that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) suffereth them to bind him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) so, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) maketh no resistance.
<p/>AND therewith No, said his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) host, that is truth, for an he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would they all were too weak so to do him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Sir, said the damosel unto Sir Gawaine, meseemeth it were your worship to help that dolorous knight, for methinketh he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is one of the best knights that ever I saw.
<p/>I would do for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), said Sir Gawaine, but it seemeth he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) will have no help. Then, said the damosel, methinketh ye have no lust to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>).
<p/>And on the other side there came a dwarf on horseback all armed save the head, with a great mouth and a short nose; and when the dwarf came nigh he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) said, Where is the lady should meet us here?
<p/>Thus as they talked they saw a knight on the other side of the laund all armed save the head. and therewithal she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came forth out of the wood.
<p/>And then they began to strive for the lady; for the knight said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and the dwarf said he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>; yonder is a knight at the cross, let us put it both upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) deemeth so shall it be.
<p/>I will well, said the knight, and so they went all three unto Sir Gawaine and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) wherefore they strove.
<p/>Will we do well? said the dwarf Well, sirs, said he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>), will ye put the matter in my hand? Yea, they said both.
<p/>Now damosel, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall stand betwixt them both, and whether ye list better to go to, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) shall have you.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) was set between them both, she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) left the knight and went to the dwarf, and the dwarf took her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) and went his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) way singing, and the knight went his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) way with great mourning.
<p/>Then came there two knights all armed, and cried on high, Sir Gawaine! knight of King Arthur's, make thee ready in all haste and joust with me.
<p/>The meanwhile the other knight went to the damosel, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) abode with that knight, and if ye would abide with me, I will be your faithful knight.
<p/>And with you will I be, said the damosel, for with Sir Gawaine I may not find in mine heart to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); for now here was one knight discomfited ten knights, and at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was cowardly led away; and therefore let us two go whilst they fight.
<p/>So they ran together, that either fell down, and then on foot they drew their swords, and did full actually. And Sir Gawaine fought with that other knight long, but at the last they accorded both.
<p/>So as Sir Gawaine went with this knight he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), What knight is he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in this country that smote down the ten knights?
<p/>For when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had done so manfully he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) suffered them to bind him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand and foot, and so led him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) away.
<p/>Ah, said the knight, that is the best knight I trow in the world, and the most man of prowess, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath been served so as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was even more than ten times, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name hight Sir Pelleas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) loveth a great lady in this country and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name is Ettard.
<p/>And so when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) there was cried in this country a great jousts three days, and all the knights of this country were there and gentlewomen, and who that proved him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) the best knight should have a passing good sword and a circlet of gold, and the circlet the knight should give it to the fairest lady that was at the jousts.
<p/>And this knight Sir Pelleas was the best knight that was there, and there were five hundred knights, but there was never man that ever Sir Pelleas met withal
<p/>And then the knight prayed Sir Gawaine to lodge with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) that night. but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) down, or else from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse;
<p/>and every day of three days he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) struck down twenty knights, therefore they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) the prize, and forthwithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) went thereas the Lady Ettard was, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) the circlet, and said openly she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) was the fairest lady that there was, and that would he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) prove upon any knight that would say nay.
<p/>How King Pelleas suffered himself to be taken prisoner because he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have a sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady, and how Sir Gawaine promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) to get to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) the love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) lady.
<p/>AND so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) chose her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sovereign lady, and never to love other but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so proud that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had scorn of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would never love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) would die for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>Wherefore all ladies and gentlewomen had scorn of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so proud, for there were fairer than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and there was none that was there
<p/>And so this knight promised the Lady Ettard to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) into this country, and never to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And thus he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is here the most part nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>), and lodged by a priory, and every week she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) sendeth knights to fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath put them to the worse, then will he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) suffer them wilfully to take him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) prisoner, because he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have a sight of this lady.
<p/>And always she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doth him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) great despite, for sometime she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) maketh her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knights to tie him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse's tail, and some to bind him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) under the horse's belly; thus in the most shamefullest ways that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can think he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>And all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doth it for to cause him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to leave this country, and to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) loving; but all this cannot make him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to leave, for an he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have fought on foot he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might have had the better of the ten knights as well on foot as on horseback.
<p/>Alas, said Sir Gawaine, it is great pity of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); and after this night I will seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) to-morrow, in this forest, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) all the help I can.
<p/>So on the morn Sir Gawaine took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) host Sir Carados, and rode into the forest; and at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) met with Sir Pelleas, making great moan out of measure, so each of them saluted other, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) made such sorrow.
<p/>CHAPTER XXI. but an Sir Pelleas would have proffered them love, they would have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) noble prowess. And as it is above rehearsed, Sir Pelleas told Sir Gawaine:
<p/>But always I suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knights to fare so with me as ye saw yesterday, in trust at the last to win her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) love, for she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knoweth well all her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knights should not lightly win me, an me list to fight with them to the uttermost.
<p/>I might die so oft, rather than I would suffer that despite; but I trust she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will have pity upon me at the last, for love causeth many a good knight to suffer to have his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) entent, but alas I am unfortunate.
<p/>Wherefore an I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) not so sore , I had liefer die an hundred times, an And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made so great dole and sorrow that unnethe he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might hold him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on horseback.
<p/>Now, said Sir Gawaine, leave your mourning and I shall promise you by the faith of my body to do all that lieth in my power to get you the love of your lady, and thereto I will plight you my troth.
<p/>And then Sir Gawaine said, I am of the court of King Arthur, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sister's son, and King Lot of Orkney was my father, and my name is Sir Gawaine.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) said, My name is Sir Pelleas, born in the Isles, and of many isles I am lord, and never have I loved lady nor damosel till now in an unhappy time; and, sir knight,
<p/>since ye are so nigh cousin unto King Arthur, and a king's son, therefore betray me not but help me, for I may never come by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) but
<p/>by some good knight, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is in a strong castle here, fast by within this four mile, and over all this country she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is lady of.
<p/>Ah, said Sir Pelleas, of what court are ye? tell me, I pray you, my good friend. And so I may never come to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) presence, but as I suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knights to take me, and
<p/>but if I did so that I might have a sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I had been dead long or this time; and yet fair word had I never of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but when I am brought to-fore her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
<p/>And then they take my horse and harness and put me out of the gates, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will not suffer me to eat nor drink; and always I offer me to be her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prisoner, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will not suffer me, for I would desire no more, what pains so ever I had, so that I might have a sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daily.
<p/>shall I amend an ye will do as I shall devise: I will have your horse and your armour, and so will I ride unto her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) castle and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that I have slain you, and so shall I come within her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to cause her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to cherish me, and
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rebuketh me in the foulest manner. Well, said Sir Gawaine, all this then shall I do my true part that ye shall not fail to have the love of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>AND therewith Sir Gawaine plight his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) troth unto Sir Pelleas to be true and faithful unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); so each one plight their troth to other, and so they changed horses and harness, and Sir Gawaine departed, and came to the castle whereas stood the pavilions of this lady without the gate.
<p/>CHAPTER XXII. How Sir Gawaine came to the Lady Ettard, and how Sir Pelleas found them sleeping. And as soon as Ettard had espied Sir Gawaine she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) fled in toward the castle.
<p/>Sir Gawaine spake on high, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) abide, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was not Sir Pelleas; I am another knight that have slain Sir Pelleas.
<p/>And so when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) saw that it was not Sir Pelleas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) alight and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) castle, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) faithfully whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) had slain Sir Pelleas.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) said her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) yea, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) name was Sir Gawaine of the court of King Arthur, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sister's son.
<p/>Truly, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>), that is great pity, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was a passing good knight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) body, but of all men alive
<p/>Do off your helm, said the Lady Ettard, that I may see your visage. I hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) most, for I could never be quit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); and for ye have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>)
<p/>I shall be your woman, and to do anything that might please you. So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made Sir Gawaine good cheer. Then Sir Gawaine said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) loved a lady and by no means she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is to blame, said Ettard, an she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) will not love you, for ye that be so well born a man, and such a man of prowess, there is no lady in the world too good for you.
<p/>Will ye, said Sir Gawaine, promise me to do all that ye may, by the faith of your body, to get me the love of my lady?
<p/>Yea, sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and that I promise you by the faith of my body. Now, said Sir Gawaine, it is yourself that I love so well,
<p/>I may not choose, said the Lady Ettard, but if I should be forsworn; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) granted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) to fulfil all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) desire.
<p/>So it was then in the month of May that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) and Sir Gawaine went out of the castle and supped in a pavilion, and there was made a bed, and there Sir Gawaine and the Lady Ettard went to bed together, and in another pavilion she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) damosels, and in the third pavilion she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) laid part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) knights, for then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) had no dread of Sir Pelleas.
<p/>therefore I pray you hold your promise. And there Sir Gawaine lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) in that pavilion two days and two nights.
<p/>And on the third day, in the morning early, Sir Pelleas armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) had never slept since Sir Gawaine departed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); for Sir Gawaine had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) by the faith of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) body, to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) pavilion by that priory within the space of a day and a night.
<p/>Then Sir Pelleas mounted upon horseback, and came to the pavilions that stood without the castle, and found in the first pavilion three knights in three beds, and three squires lying at their feet.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) yede to the third pavilion and found Sir Gawaine lying in bed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) Lady Ettard, and either clipping other in arms, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) heart well-nigh brast for sorrow, and said: Alas! that ever a knight should be found so false; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and might not abide no longer for pure sorrow.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had ridden nigh half a mile he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) turned again and thought to slay them both; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw them both so lie sleeping fast, unnethe he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might hold him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on horseback for sorrow, and said thus to himself,
<p/>Though this knight be never so false, I will never slay him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sleeping, for I will never destroy the high order of knighthood; and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) departed again.
<p/>And or he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had ridden half a mile he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) returned again, and thought then to slay them both, making the greatest sorrow that ever man made.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to the pavilions, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tied his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse unto a tree, and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sword naked in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and went to them thereas they lay,
<p/>and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought it were shame to slay them sleeping, and laid the naked sword overthwart both their throats, and so took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse and rode his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.
<p/>And when Sir Pelleas came to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pavilions he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knights and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) squires how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sped, and said thus to them, For your true and good service ye have done me I shall give you all my goods, for I will go unto my bed and never arise until I am dead.
<p/>And when that I am dead I charge you that ye take the heart out of my body and bear it her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) betwixt two silver dishes, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) how I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lie with the false knight Sir Gawaine.
<p/>Then went he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) to the second pavilion and found four gentlewomen lying in four beds. Right so Sir Pelleas unarmed himself, and went unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) bed making marvellous dole and sorrow.
<p/>When Sir Gawaine and Ettard awoke of their sleep, and found the naked sword overthwart their throats, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) knew well it was Sir Pelleas' sword.
<p/>Alas! said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) to Sir Gawaine, ye have betrayed me and Sir Pelleas both, for ye told me ye had slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and now I know well it is not so
<p/>And if Sir Pelleas had been as uncourteous to you as ye have been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) ye had been a dead knight; but ye have deceived me and betrayed me falsely, that all ladies and damosels may beware by you and me.
<p/>So it happed then that the Damosel of the Lake, Nimue, met with a knight of Sir Pelleas, that went on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) foot in the forest making great dole, and she (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) the cause.
<p/>And so the woful knight told her (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>) how his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) master and lord was betrayed through a knight and lady, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will never arise out of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bed till he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be dead.
<p/>Bring me to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), said she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) anon, and I will warrant his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall not die for love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that hath caused him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) so to love, she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall be in as evil plight as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is or
<p/>it be long to, for it is no joy of such a proud lady that will have no mercy of such a valiant knight.
<p/>Anon that knight brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) unto him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lie in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw never so likely a knight; and therewith she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) threw an enchantment upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is alive. And therewith Sir Gawaine made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) ready, and went into the forest. And therewhile she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode unto the Lady Ettard, and charged no man to awake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) came again.
<p/>So within two hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) brought the Lady Ettard thither, and both ladies found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asleep: Lo, said the Damosel of the Lake, ye ought to be ashamed for to murder such a knight.
<p/>And therewith she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) threw such an enchantment upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sore, that well-nigh she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) was out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) mind.
<p/>O Lord Jesu, said the Lady Ettard, how is it befallen unto me that I love now him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesu</b></font>) that I have most hated of any man alive?
<p/>And then anon Sir Pelleas awaked and looked upon Ettard; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) more than any woman alive, and said: Away, traitress, come never in my sight.
<p/>That is the righteous judgment of God, said the damosel. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) say so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ettard</b></font>) wept and made great sorrow out of measure.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Pelleas loved no more Ettard by means of the Damosel of the Lake, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loved ever after.
<p/>SIR KNIGHT PELLEAS, said the Damosel of the Lake, take your horse and come forth with me out of this country, and ye shall love a lady that shall love you.
<p/>I will well, said Sir Pelleas, for this Lady Ettard hath done me great despite and shame, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) the beginning and ending, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had purposed never to have arisen till that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been dead.
<p/>And now such grace God hath sent me, that I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) as much as ever I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), thanked be our Lord Jesus!
<p/>Anon Sir Pelleas armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) horse, and commanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) men to bring after his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) pavilions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) stuff where the Damosel of the Lake would assign.
<p/>So the Lady Ettard died for sorrow, and the Damosel of the Lake rejoiced Sir Pelleas, and loved together during their life days.
<p/>Thank me, said the Damosel of the Lake. CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Marhaus rode with the damosel, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) came to the Duke of the South Marches.
<p/>And so they came into a deep forest, and by fortune they were nighted, and rode long in a deep way, and at the last they came unto a courtelage, and there they asked harbour.
<p/>But the man of the courtelage would not lodge them for no treatise that they could treat, but thus much the good man said, An ye will take the adventure of your lodging, I shall bring you where ye shall be lodged.
<p/>NOW turn we unto Sir Marhaus, that rode with the damosel of thirty winter of age, southward. What adventure is that that I shall have for my lodging? said Sir Marhaus.
<p/>Ye shall wit when ye come there, said the good man. Sir, what adventure so it be, bring me thither I pray thee, said Sir Marhaus; for I am weary, my damosel, and my horse.
<p/>So the good man went and opened the gate, and within an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unto a fair castle, and then the poor man called the porter, and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was let into the castle, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told the lord how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a knight errant and a damosel that would be lodged with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in, said the lord, it may happen he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shall repent that they took their lodging here. So Sir Marhaus was let in with torchlight, and there was a goodly sight of young men that welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).
<p/>And then his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) horse was led into the stable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) and the damosel were brought into the hall, and there stood a mighty duke and many goodly men about him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) said, I am a knight of King Arthur's and knight of the Table Round, and my name is Sir Marhaus, and born I am in Ireland.
<p/>Then this lord asked him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hight, and from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) came, and with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) dwelt. And then said the duke to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), That me sore repenteth
<p/>: the cause is this, for I love not thy lord nor none of thy fellows of the Table Round; and therefore ease thyself this night as well as thou mayest, for as to-morn I and my six sons shall match with you.
<p/>Is there no remedy but that I must have ado with you and your six sons at once? said Sir Marhaus.
<p/>No, said the duke, for this cause I made mine avow, for Sir Gawaine slew my seven sons in a recounter, therefore I made mine avow, there should never knight of King Arthur's court lodge with me, or come thereas
<p/>I might have ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), but that I would have a revenging of my sons' death. What is your name? said Sir Marhaus
<p/>Ah, said Sir Marhaus, I have heard say that ye have been long time a great foe unto my lord Arthur and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights.
<p/>; I require you tell me, an it please you. Wit thou well I am the Duke of South Marches. That shall ye feel to-morn, said the duke.
<p/>Yea, said the duke, thereof shalt thou not choose, and therefore take you to your chamber, and ye shall have all that to you longeth.
<p/>Shall I have ado with you? said Sir Marhaus. So Sir Marhaus departed and was led to a chamber, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) damosel was led unto her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chamber.
<p/>And so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and then there was a mass sung afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and brake his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fast, and so mounted on horseback in the court of the castle where they should do the battle.
<p/>So there was the duke all ready on horseback, clean armed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) six sons by him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and everych had a spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand, and so they encountered, whereas the duke and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) two sons brake their spears upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), but Sir Marhaus held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) spear and touched none of them.
<p/>And on the morn the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus and bade make him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ready. CHAPTER XXV. How Sir Marhaus fought with the duke and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) four sons and made them to yield them.
<p/>THEN came the four sons by couple, and two of them brake their spears, and so did the other two. And all this while Sir Marhaus touched them not.
<p/>Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) spear that horse and man fell to the earth, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) served his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sons; and then Sir Marhaus alighted down and bade the duke yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>And then some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sons recovered, and would have set upon Sir Marhaus; then Sir Marhaus said to the duke,
<p/>Then the duke saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might not escape the death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cried to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sons, and charged them to yield them to Sir Marhaus; and they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords to the knight, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) received them.
<p/>And then they helped up their father, and so by their cominal assent promised to Sir Marhaus never to be foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon at Whitsuntide after to come, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sons, and put them in the king's grace.
<p/>Then Sir Marhaus departed, and within two days his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) damosel brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) whereas was a great tournament that the Lady de Vawse had cried.
<p/>Cease thy sons, or else I will do the uttermost to you all. And who that did best should have a rich circlet of gold worth a thousand besants.
<p/>And there Sir Marhaus did so nobly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was renowned, and had sometime down forty knights, and so the circlet of gold was rewarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) departed from them with great worship; and so within seven nights his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) damosel brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to an earl's place, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) name was the Earl Fergus, that after was Sir Tristram's knight; and this earl was but a young man, and late come into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lands, and there was a giant fast by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that hight Taulurd, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had another brother in Cornwall that hight Taulas, that Sir Tristram slew when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) mind.
<p/>So this earl made his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) complaint unto Sir Marhaus, that there was a giant by him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) that destroyed all his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) lands, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) durst nowhere ride nor go for him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>).
<p/>Sir, said the knight, whether useth he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to fight on horseback or on foot? Nay, said the earl, there may no horse bear him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>).
<p/>Well, said Sir Marhaus, then will I fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) on foot; so on the morn Sir Marhaus prayed the earl that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) men might bring him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) whereas the giant was; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) was, for he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) sit under a tree of holly, and many clubs of iron and gisarms about him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>).
<p/>So this knight dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to the giant, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and the giant took an iron club in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand, and at the first stroke he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) clave Sir Marhaus' shield in two pieces.
<p/>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was in great peril, for the giant was a wily fighter, but at last Sir Marhaus smote off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) right arm above the elbow.
<p/>Then the giant fled and the knight after him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) drove him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) into a water, but the giant was so high that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might not wade after him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And then Sir Marhaus made the Earl Fergus' man to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) stones, and with those stones the knight gave the giant many sore knocks, till at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fall down into the water, and so was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) there dead.
<p/>Then Sir Marhaus went unto the giant's castle, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) delivered twenty-four ladies and twelve knights out of the giant's prison, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had great riches without number, so that the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was never poor man.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) returned to the Earl Fergus, the which thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) greatly, and would have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) half his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) lands, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) would none take.
<p/>So Sir Marhaus dwelled with the earl nigh half a year, for he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) was sore bruised with the giant, and at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) leave.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) rode by the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) met with Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine, and so by adventure he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) met with four knights of Arthur's court,
<p/>the first was Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Osanna, Sir Dodinas le Savage, and Sir Felot of Listinoise; and there Sir Marhaus with one spear
<p/>smote down these four knights, and hurt them sore. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) departed to meet at his (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) day aforeset. CHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Uwaine rode with the damosel of sixty year of age, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) gat the prize at tourneying.
<p/>NOW turn we unto Sir Uwaine, that rode westward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) damosel of three score winter of age, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) thereas was a tournament nigh the march of Wales.
<p/>And at that tournament Sir Uwaine smote down thirty knights, therefore was given him (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) the prize, and that was a gerfalcon, and a white steed trapped with cloth of gold.
<p/>So then Sir Uwaine did many strange adventures by the means of the old damosel, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) to a lady that was called the Lady of the Rock, the which was much courteous.
<p/>So there were in the country two knights that were brethren, and they were called two perilous knights, the one knight hight Sir Edward of the Red Castle, and the other Sir Hue of the Red Castle; and these two brethren had disherited the Lady of the Rock of a barony of lands by their extortion.
<p/>Madam, said Sir Uwaine, they are to blame, for they do against the high order of knighthood, and the oath that they made; and if it like you
<p/>I will speak with them, because I am a knight of King Arthur's, and I will entreat them with fairness; and if they will not, I shall do battle with them, and in the defence of your right.
<p/>And as this knight was lodged with this lady she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) complaint to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of these two knights. Gramercy said the lady, and thereas I may not acquit you, God shall.
<p/>So on the morn the two knights were sent for, that they should come thither to speak with the Lady of the Rock, and wit ye
<p/>But when this lady saw them in this manner so big, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not suffer Sir Uwaine to go out to them upon no surety nor for no fair language, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) speak with them over a tower, but finally these two brethren would not be entreated, and answered that they would keep that they had.
<p/>well they failed not, for they came with an hundred horse. Well, said Sir Uwaine, then will I fight with one of you, and prove that ye do this lady wrong.
<p/>That will we not, said they, for an we do battle, we two will fight with one knight at once, and therefore if ye will fight so, we will be ready at what hour ye will assign.
<p/>Ye say well, said Sir Uwaine, therefore make you ready so that ye be here to-morn in the defence of the lady's right.
<p/>And if ye win us in battle the lady shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lands again. CHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Uwaine fought with two knights and overcame them.
<p/>SO was there sikerness made on both parties that no treason should be wrought on neither party; so then the knights departed and made them ready, and that night Sir Uwaine had great cheer.
<p/>And on the morn he (<font color='blue'><b>Uwaine</b></font>) arose early and heard mass, and brake his (<font color='blue'><b>Uwaine</b></font>) fast, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Uwaine</b></font>) rode unto the plain without the gates, where hoved the two brethren abiding him (<font color='blue'><b>Uwaine</b></font>).
<p/>So they rode together passing sore, that Sir Edward and Sir Hue brake their spears upon Sir Uwaine. And Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fell over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) horse and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spear brast not.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spurred his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) horse and came upon Sir Hue and overthrew him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), but they soon recovered and dressed their shields and drew their swords and bade Sir Uwaine alight and do his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) battle to the uttermost.
<p/>Then Sir Uwaine devoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) horse suddenly, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shield afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sword, and so they dressed together, and either gave other such strokes, and there these two brethren wounded Sir Uwaine passing grievously that the Lady of the Rock weened he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should have died.
<p/>And at the last Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward upon the helm such a stroke that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sword carved unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) canel bone, and then Sir Hue abated his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) courage, but Sir Uwaine pressed fast to have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<p/>And thus they fought together five hours as men raged out of reason. That saw Sir Hue: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) kneeled down and yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to Sir Uwaine.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gentleness received his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sword, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) by the hand, and went into the castle together. Then the Lady of the Rock was passing glad, and the other brother made great sorrow for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brother's death.
<p/>Then the lady was restored of all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lands, and Sir Hue was commanded to be at the court of King Arthur at the next feast of Pentecost.
<p/>So Sir Uwaine dwelt with the lady nigh half a year, for it was long or he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might be whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) great hurts.
<p/>And so when it drew nigh the term-day that Sir Gawaine, Sir Marhaus, and Sir Uwaine should meet at the cross-way, then every knight drew him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) thither to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) promise that they had made; and Sir Marhaus and Sir Uwaine brought their damosels with them, but Sir Gawaine had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) damosel, as it is afore rehearsed.
<p/>RIGHT so at the twelvemonths' end they met all three knights at the fountain and their damosels, but the damosel that Sir Gawaine had could say but little worship of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>)
<p/>so they departed from the damosels and rode through a great forest, and there they met with a messenger that came from King Arthur
<p/>, that had sought them well-nigh a twelvemonth throughout all England, Wales, and Scotland, and charged if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might find Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine to bring them to the court again.
<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII. How at the year's end all three knights with their three damosels met at the fountain. And then were they all glad, and so prayed they Sir Marhaus to ride with them to the king's court.
<p/>And so within twelve days they came to Camelot, and the king was passing glad of their coming, and so was all the court.
<p/>Then the king made them to swear upon a book to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) all their adventures that had befallen them that twelvemonth, and so they did.
<p/>And there was Sir Marhaus well known, for there were knights that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had matched aforetime, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was named one of the best knights living.
<p/>Against the feast of Pentecost came the Damosel of the Lake and brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) Sir Pelleas; and at that high feast there was great jousting of knights, and of all knights that were at that jousts, Sir Pelleas had the prize, and Sir Marhaus was named the next; but Sir Pelleas was so strong there
<p/>And at that next feast Sir Pelleas and Sir Marhaus were made knights of the Table Round, for there were two sieges void, for two knights were slain that twelvemonth, and great joy had King Arthur of Sir Pelleas and of Sir Marhaus.
<p/>But Pelleas loved never after Sir Gawaine, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) spared him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) for the love of King Arthur; but ofttimes at jousts and tournaments Sir Pelleas quit Sir Gawaine, for so it rehearseth in the book of French.
<p/>So Sir Tristram many days after fought with Sir Marhaus in an island, and there they did a great battle, but at the last Sir Tristram slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), so Sir Tristram was wounded that unnethe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might recover, and lay at a nunnery half a year.
<p/>And Sir Pelleas was a worshipful knight, and was one of the four that achieved the Sangreal, and the Damosel of the Lake made by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) means that never he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had ado with Sir Launcelot de Lake, for where Sir Launcelot was at any jousts or any tournament, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Lake</b></font>) be there that day, but if it were on the side of Sir Launcelot.
<p/>might but few knights sit him (<font color='blue'><b>Lake</b></font>) a buffet with a spear. Explicit liber quartus. Incipit liber quintus. BOOK V. CHAPTER I.
<p/>WHEN King Arthur had after long war rested, and held a royal feast and Table Round with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) allies of kings, princes, and noble knights all of the Round Table, there came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) throne royal, twelve ancient men, bearing each of them a branch of olive, in token that they came as ambassadors and messengers from the Emperor Lucius, which was called at that time, Dictator or Procuror of the Public Weal of Rome.
<p/>Which said messengers, after their entering and coming into the presence of King Arthur, did to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) their obeisance in making to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) reverence, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) in this wise: The high and mighty Emperor Lucius sendeth to the King of Britain greeting, commanding thee to acknowledge him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) for thy lord, and to send him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) the truage due of this realm unto the Empire, which thy father and other to-fore thy precessors have paid as is of record, and thou as rebel not knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) as thy sovereign, withholdest and retainest contrary to the statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy Julius Cesar, conqueror of this realm, and first Emperor of Rome.
<p/>And if thou refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) demand and commandment know thou for certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) shall make strong war against thee, thy realms and lands, and shall chastise thee and thy subjects, that it shall be ensample perpetual unto all kings and princes, for to deny their truage unto that noble empire which domineth upon the universal world.
<p/>Then when they had showed the effect of their message, the king commanded them to withdraw them, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) should take advice of council and give to them an answer.
<p/>Then some of the young knights, hearing this their message, would have run on them to have slain them, saying that it was a rebuke to all the knights there being present to suffer them to say so to the king.
<p/>And anon the king commanded that none of them, upon pain of death, to missay them nor do them any harm, and commanded a knight to bring them to their lodging, and see that they have all that is necessary and requisite for them, with the best cheer, and that no dainty be spared, for the Romans be great lords, and though their message please me not nor my court, yet I must remember mine honour.
<p/>After this the king let call all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lords and knights of the Round Table to counsel upon this matter, and desired them to say their advice.
<p/>How twelve aged ambassadors of Rome came to King Arthur to demand truage for Britain. Then Sir Cador of Cornwall spake first and said, Sir, this message liketh me well,
<p/>for we have many days rested us and have been idle, and now I hope ye shall make sharp war on the Romans, where I doubt not we shall get honour.
<p/>I believe well, said Arthur, that this matter pleaseth thee well, but these answers may not be answered, for the demand grieveth me sore, for truly I will never pay truage to Rome, wherefore I pray you to counsel me.
<p/>I have understood that Belinus and Brenius, kings of Britain, have had the empire in their hands many days, and also Constantine the son of Heleine, which is an open evidence that we owe no tribute to Rome but of right
<p/>we that be descended of them have right to claim the title of the empire. CHAPTER II. How the kings and lords promised to King Arthur aid and help against the Romans.
<p/>THEN answered King Anguish of Scotland, Sir, ye ought of right to be above all other kings, for unto you is none like nor pareil in Christendom, of knighthood nor of dignity, and I counsel you never to obey the Romans, for when they reigned on us they distressed our elders, and put this land to great extortions and tallies, wherefore I make here mine avow to avenge me on them; and for to strengthen your quarrel I shall furnish twenty thousand good men of war, and wage them on my costs, which shall await on you with myself when it shall please you.
<p/>And then every man agreed to make war, and to aid after their power; that is to wit, the lord of West Wales promised to bring thirty thousand men, and Sir Uwaine, Sir Ider his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) son, with their cousins, promised to bring thirty thousand.
<p/>And the king of Little Britain granted him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to the same thirty thousand; wherefore King Arthur thanked them. Then Sir Launcelot with all other promised in likewise every man a great multitude.
<p/>And when King Arthur understood their courages and good wills he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thanked them heartily, and after let call the ambassadors to hear their answer.
<p/>And in presence of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lords and knights he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said to them in this wise: I will that ye return unto your lord and Procuror of the Common Weal for the Romans, and say ye to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), Of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) demand and commandment I set nothing, and that I know of no truage nor tribute that I owe to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), nor to none earthly prince, Christian nor heathen; but I pretend to have and occupy the sovereignty of the empire, wherein I am entitled by the right of my predecessors, sometime kings of this land; and say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) that I am delibered and fully concluded, to go with mine army with strength and power unto Rome, by the grace of God, to take possession in the empire and subdue them that be rebel.
<p/>Wherefore I command him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and all them of Rome, that incontinent they make to me their homage, and to acknowledge me for their Emperor and Governor, upon pain that shall ensue.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) commanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) treasurer to give to them great and large gifts, and to pay all their dispenses, and assigned Sir Cador to convey them out of the land.
<p/>And so they took their leave and departed, and took their shipping at Sandwich, and passed forth by Flanders, Almaine, the mountains, and all Italy, until they came unto Lucius.
<p/>When the Emperor Lucius had well understood their credence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) was sore moved as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) had been all araged, and said, I had supposed that Arthur would have obeyed to my commandment, and have served you himself, as him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) well beseemed or any other king to do.
<p/>O Sir, said one of the senators, let be such vain words, for we let you wit that I and my fellows were full sore afeard to behold his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) countenance
<p/>; I fear me ye have made a rod for yourself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) intendeth to be lord of this empire, which sore is to be doubted
<p/>if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) come, for he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is all another man than ye ween, and holdeth the most noble court of the world, all other kings nor princes may not compare unto his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) noble maintenance.
<p/>On New Year's Day we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) estate, which was the royalest that ever we saw, for he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was served at his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) table with nine kings, and the noblest fellowship of other princes, lords, and knights that be in the world, and every knight approved and like a lord, and holdeth Table Round: and in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) person the most manly man that liveth, and is like to conquer all the world, for unto his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) courage it is too little
<p/>: wherefore I advise you to keep well your marches and straits in the mountains; for certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is a lord to be doubted.
<p/>Well, said Lucius, before Easter I suppose to pass the mountains, and so forth into France, and there bereave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) lands with Genoese and other mighty warriors of Tuscany and Lombardy.
<p/>And I shall send for them all that be subjects and allied to the empire of Rome to come to mine aid.
<p/>And forthwith sent old wise knights unto these countries following: first to Ambage and Arrage, to Alexandria, to India, to Armenia, whereas the river of Euphrates runneth into Asia, to Africa, and Europe the Large, to Ertayne and Elamye, to Araby, Egypt, and to Damascus, to Damietta and Cayer, to Cappadocia, to Tarsus, Turkey, Pontus and Pamphylia, to Syria and Galatia.
<p/>And all these were subject to Rome and many more, as Greece, Cyprus, Macedonia, Calabria, Cateland, Portugal, with many thousands of Spaniards.
<p/>And after the reverence made, they made relation of their answer, like as ye to-fore have heard. Thus all these kings, dukes, and admirals, assembled about Rome, with sixteen kings at once, with great multitude of people.
<p/>Also he (<font color='blue'><b>multitude</b></font>) had gotten with him (<font color='blue'><b>multitude</b></font>) fifty giants which had been engendered of fiends; and they were ordained to guard his (<font color='blue'><b>multitude</b></font>) person, and to break the front of the battle of King Arthur.
<p/>And thus departed from Rome, and came down the mountains for to destroy the lands that Arthur had conquered, and came unto Cologne, and besieged a castle thereby, and won it soon, and stuffed it with two hundred Saracens or Infidels, and after destroyed many fair countries which Arthur had won of King Claudas.
<p/>And thus Lucius came with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) host, which were disperplyd sixty mile in breadth, and commanded them to meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) in Burgoyne, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) purposed to destroy the realm of Little Britain.
<p/>When the emperor understood their coming he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) made ready his (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) Romans and all the people between him (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) and Flanders. CHAPTER III.
<p/>NOW leave we of Lucius the Emperor and speak we of King Arthur, that commanded all them of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) retinue to be ready at the utas of Hilary for to hold a parliament at York.
<p/>And at that parliament was concluded to arrest all the navy of the land, and to be ready within fifteen days at Sandwich, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) showed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) army how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) purposed to conquer the empire which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ought to have of right.
<p/>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ordained two governors of this realm, that is to say, Sir Baudwin of Britain, for to counsel to the best, and Sir Constantine, son to Sir Cador of Cornwall, which after the death of Arthur was king of this realm.
<p/>And in the presence of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lords he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) resigned the rule of the realm and Guenever his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) queen to them, wherefore Sir Launcelot was wroth, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) left Sir Tristram with King Mark for the love of Beale Isould.
<p/>Then the Queen Guenever made great sorrow for the departing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) lord and other, and swooned in such wise that the ladies bare her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) chamber.
<p/>Thus the king with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) great army departed, leaving the queen and realm in the governance of Sir Baudwin and Constantine.
<p/>How King Arthur held a parliament at York, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ordained the realm should be governed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) absence. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said with an high voice,
<p/>If I die in this journey I will that Sir Constantine be mine heir and king crowned of this realm as next of my blood.
<p/>And after departed and entered into the sea at Sandwich with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Constantine</b></font>) army, with a great multitude of ships, galleys, cogs, and dromounds, sailing on the sea.
<p/>CHAPTER IV. How King Arthur being shipped and lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cabin had a marvellous dream and of the exposition thereof.
<p/>AND as the king lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cabin in the ship, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fell in a slumbering and dreamed a marvellous dream: him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) seemed that a dreadful dragon did drown much of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came flying out of the west, and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) head was enamelled with azure, and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shoulders shone as gold, his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) belly like mails of a marvellous hue, his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) tail full of tatters, his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) feet full of fine sable, and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) claws like fine gold; and an hideous flame of fire flew out of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mouth, like as the land and water had flamed all of fire.
<p/>After, him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) seemed there came out of the orient, a grimly boar all black in a cloud, and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) paws as big as a post; he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was rugged looking roughly, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was the foulest beast that ever man saw, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) roared and romed so hideously that it were marvel to hear.
<p/>Then the dreadful dragon advanced him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and came in the wind like a falcon giving great strokes on the boar, and the boar hit him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) again with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) grizzly tusks that his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) breast was all bloody, and that the hot blood made all the sea red of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) blood.
<p/>Then the dragon flew away all on an height, and came down with such a swough, and smote the boar on the ridge, which was ten foot large from the head to the tail, and smote the boar all to powder both flesh and bones, that it flittered all abroad on the sea.
<p/>And therewith the king awoke anon, and was sore abashed of this dream, and sent anon for a wise philosopher, commanding to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) the signification of his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) dream.
<p/>Sir, said the philosopher, the dragon that thou dreamedst of betokeneth thine own person that sailest here, and the colours of his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) wings be thy realms that thou hast won, and his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) tail which is all to-tattered signifieth the noble knights of the Round Table; and the boar that the dragon slew coming from the clouds betokeneth some tyrant that tormenteth the people, or else thou art like to fight with some giant thyself, being horrible and abominable, whose peer ye saw never in your days
<p/>Then after this soon they had sight of land, and sailed till they arrived at Barflete in Flanders, and when they were there he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) found many of his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) great lords ready, as they had been commanded to wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>).
<p/>, wherefore of this dreadful dream doubt thee nothing, but as a conqueror come forth thyself. CHAPTER V. How a man of the country told to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of a marvellous giant, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fought and conquered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>THEN came to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an husbandman of the country, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) how there was in the country of Constantine beside Brittany, a great giant which had slain, murdered and devoured much people of the country, and had been sustained seven year with the children of the commons of that land, insomuch that all the children be all slain and destroyed; and now late he (<font color='blue'><b>Constantine</b></font>) hath taken the Duchess of Brittany as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brittany</b></font>) rode with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brittany</b></font>) meiny, and hath led her (<font color='blue'><b>Brittany</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Constantine</b></font>) lodging which is in a mountain, for to ravish and lie by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brittany</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brittany</b></font>) life's end, and many people followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Brittany</b></font>), more than five hundred, but
<p/>all they might not rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Brittany</b></font>), but they left her (<font color='blue'><b>Brittany</b></font>) shrieking and crying lamentably, wherefore I suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Constantine</b></font>) hath slain her (<font color='blue'><b>Brittany</b></font>) in fulfilling his (<font color='blue'><b>Constantine</b></font>) foul lust of lechery.
<p/>Now, as thou art a rightful king, have pity on this lady, and revenge us all as thou art a noble conqueror.
<p/>Alas, said King Arthur, this is a great mischief, I had liefer than the best realm that I have that I had been
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was wife unto thy cousin Sir Howell, whom we call full nigh of thy blood. a furlong way to-fore him (<font color='blue'><b>Howell</b></font>) for to have rescued that lady.
<p/>Now, fellow, said King Arthur, canst thou bring me thereas this giant haunteth? Yea, Sir, said the good man, look yonder whereas thou seest those two great fires, there shalt
<p/>thou find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and more treasure than I suppose is in all France. When the king had understood this piteous case, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) returned into his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) tent.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Sir Kay and Sir Bedivere, and commanded them secretly to make ready horse and harness for himself and them twain; for after evensong he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would ride on pilgrimage with them two only unto Saint Michael's mount.
<p/>And so they three departed thence and rode forth as fast as ever they might till that they came to the foreland of that mount.
<p/>And there they alighted, and the king commanded them to tarry there, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would himself go up into that mount.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ascended up into that hill till he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came to a great fire, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) found a careful widow wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) hands and making great sorrow, sitting by a grave new made.
<p/>And then anon he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ready, and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) at all points, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shield. And then King Arthur saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), and demanded of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) wherefore
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) made such lamentation, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) answered and said, Sir knight, speak soft, for yonder is a devil, if he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hear thee speak he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) will come and destroy thee; I hold thee unhappy; what dost thou here in this mountain?
<p/>for if ye were such fifty as ye be, ye were not able to make resistance against this devil: here lieth a duchess dead, the which was the fairest of all the world, wife to Sir Howell, Duke of Brittany, he (<font color='blue'><b>Howell</b></font>) hath murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and hath slit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) unto the navel.
<p/>Dame, said the king, I come from the noble conqueror King Arthur, for to treat with that tyrant for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) liege people.
<p/>Fie on such treaties, said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) setteth not by the king nor by no man else; but an if thou have brought Arthur's wife, dame Guenever, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shall be gladder than thou hadst given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) half France.
<p/>Beware, approach him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) not too nigh, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hath vanquished fifteen kings, and hath made him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) a coat full of precious stones embroidered with their beards, which they sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) love for salvation of their people at this last Christmas.
<p/>Well, said Arthur, I will accomplish my message for all your fearful words; and went forth by the crest of that hill, and saw where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sat at supper gnawing on a limb of a man, baking his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) broad limbs by the fire, and breechless, and three fair damosels turning three broaches whereon were broached twelve young children late born, like young birds.
<p/>When King Arthur beheld that piteous sight he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had great compassion on them, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) heart bled for sorrow, and hailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), saying in this wise:
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) that all the world wieldeth give thee short life and shameful death; and the devil have thy soul; why hast thou murdered these young innocent children, and murdered this duchess?
<p/>And if thou wilt, speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) at yonder great fire at supper. Therefore, arise and dress thee, thou glutton, for this day shalt thou die of my hand.
<p/>Then the glutton anon started up, and took a great club in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hand, and smote at the king that his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) coronal fell to the earth.
<p/>And the king hit him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) again that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) carved his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) belly and cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) genitours, that his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) guts and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) entrails fell down to the ground.
<p/>Then the giant threw away his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) club, and caught the king in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) arms that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) crushed his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ribs. Then the three maidens kneeled down and called to Christ for help and comfort of Arthur.
<p/>And so weltering and wallowing they rolled down the hill till they came to the sea mark, and ever as they so weltered Arthur smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dagger.
<p/>And it fortuned they came to the place whereas the two knights were and kept Arthur's horse; then when they saw the king fast in the giant's arms they came and loosed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>And then the king commanded Sir Kay to smite off the giant's head, and to set it upon a truncheon of a spear, and bear it to Sir Howell, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Howell</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Howell</b></font>) enemy was slain; and after let this head be bound to a barbican that all the people may see and behold it; and go ye two up to the mountain, and fetch me my shield, my sword, and the club of iron; and as for the treasure, take ye it, for ye shall find there goods out of number; so I have the kirtle and the club
<p/>This was the fiercest giant that ever I met with, save one in the mount of Araby, which I overcame, but this was greater and fiercer.
<p/>Then the knights fetched the club and the kirtle, and some of the treasure they took to themselves, and returned again to the host.
<p/>And then Arthur weltered and wrung, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was other while under and another time above. I desire no more. And anon this was known through all the country, wherefore the people came and thanked the king.
<p/>And after that King Arthur said and commanded his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) cousin Howell, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Howell</b></font>) should ordain for a church to be builded on the same hill in the worship of Saint Michael.
<p/>And on the morn the king removed with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) great battle, and came into Champayne and in a valley, and there they pight their tents; and the king being set at his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) dinner, there came in two messengers, of whom that one was Marshal of France, and said to the king that the emperor was entered into France, and had destroyed a great part, and was in Burgoyne, and had destroyed and made great slaughter of people, and burnt towns and boroughs; wherefore, if thou come not hastily, they must yield up their bodies and goods.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Burgoyne</b></font>) said again, Give the thanks to God, and depart the goods among you. CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur sent Sir Gawaine and other to Lucius, and how they were assailed and escaped with worship.
<p/>THEN the king did do call Sir Gawaine, Sir Bors, Sir Lionel, and Sir Bedivere, and commanded them to go straight to Sir Lucius, and say ye to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) that hastily he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) remove out of my land; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) will not, bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) ready to battle and not distress the poor people.
<p/>Then anon these noble knights dressed them to horseback, and when they came to the green wood, they saw many pavilions set in a meadow, of silk of divers colours, beside a river, and the emperor's pavilion was in the middle with an eagle displayed above.
<p/>To the which tent our knights rode toward, and ordained Sir Gawaine and Sir Bors to do the message, and left in a bushment Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere.
<p/>And then Sir Gawaine and Sir Bors did their message, and commanded Lucius, in Arthur's name to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) land, or shortly to address him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) to battle.
<p/>To whom Lucius answered and said, Ye shall return to your lord, and say ye to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) that I shall subdue him (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) lands.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine was wroth and said, I had liefer than all France fight against thee; and so had I, said Sir Bors, liefer than all Brittany or Burgoyne.
<p/>Then a knight named Sir Gainus, nigh cousin to the emperor, said, Lo, how these Britons be full of pride and boast, and they brag as though they bare up all the world.
<p/>And therewith turned their horses and rode over waters and through woods till they came to their bushment, whereas Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere were hoving.
<p/>The Romans followed fast after, on horseback and on foot, over a champaign unto a wood; then Sir Bors turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) horse and saw a knight come fast on, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) smote through the body with a spear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) fell dead down to the earth; then came Caliburn one of the strongest of Pavie, and smote down many of Arthur's knights.
<p/>And when Sir Bors saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) do so much harm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) addressed toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>), and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) through the breast, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) fell down dead to the earth.
<p/>Then Sir Feldenak thought to revenge the death of Gainus upon Sir Gawaine, but Sir Gawaine was ware thereof, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) on the head, which stroke stinted not till it came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) breast.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine was sore grieved with these words, and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sword and smote off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) head. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) returned and came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fellows in the bushment.
<p/>And there was a recounter, for the bushment brake on the Romans, and slew and hew down the Romans, and forced the Romans to flee and return, whom the noble knights chased unto their tents.
<p/>Then the Romans gathered more people, and also footmen came on, and there was a new battle, and so much people that Sir Bors and Sir Berel were taken.
<p/>But when Sir Gawaine saw that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) took with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) Sir Idrus the good knight, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) would never see King Arthur
<p/>but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) rescued them, and pulled out Galatine his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) good sword, and followed them that led those two knights away; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) that led Sir Bors, and took Sir Bors from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) and delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) fellows.
<p/>Then began the battle to be great, that our knights were in great jeopardy, wherefore Sir Gawaine sent to King Arthur for succour, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) hie him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), for I am sore wounded, and that our prisoners may pay goods out of number.
<p/>And anon the king did do assemble his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) army, but anon, or he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) departed the prisoners were come, and Sir Gawaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fellows gat the field and put the Romans to flight, and after returned and came with their fellowship in such wise that no man of worship was lost of them, save that Sir Gawaine was sore hurt.
<p/>And Sir Idrus in likewise rescued Sir Berel. And the messenger came to the king and told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) message. Then the king did do ransack his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wounds and comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>And thus was the beginning of the first journey of the Britons and Romans, and there were slain of the Romans more than ten thousand, and great joy and mirth was made that night in the host of King Arthur.
<p/>And on the morn he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sent all the prisoners into Paris under the guard of Sir Launcelot, with many knights, and of Sir Cador.
<p/>How Lucius sent certain spies in a bushment for to have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) knights being prisoners, and how they were letted.
<p/>NOW turn we to the Emperor of Rome, which espied that these prisoners should be sent to Paris, and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) sent to lie in a bushment certain knights and princes with sixty thousand men, for to rescue his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) knights and lords that were prisoners.
<p/>And so on the morn as Launcelot and Sir Cador, chieftains and governors of all them that conveyed the prisoners, as they should pass through a wood, Sir Launcelot sent certain knights to espy if any were in the woods to let them.
<p/>And when the said knights came into the wood, anon they espied and saw the great embushment, and returned and told Sir Launcelot that there lay in await for them three score thousand Romans.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot with such knights as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) had, and men of war to the number of ten thousand, put them in array, and met with them and fought with them manly, and slew and detrenched many of the Romans, and slew many knights and admirals of the party of the Romans and Saracens; there was slain the king of Lyly and three great lords, Aladuke, Herawd, and Heringdale.
<p/>But Sir Launcelot fought so nobly that no man might endure a stroke of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, but where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prowess and might, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slew down right on every side; and the Romans and Saracens fled from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as the sheep from the wolf or from the lion, and put them, all that abode alive, to flight.
<p/>And so long they fought that tidings came to King Arthur, and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) graithed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and came to the battle, and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knights how they had vanquished the battle
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) embraced them knight by knight in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) arms, and said, Ye be worthy to wield all your honour and worship; there was never king save myself that had so noble knights.
<p/>Sir, said Cador, there was none of us failed other, but of the prowess and manhood of Sir Launcelot were more than wonder to tell, and also of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cousins which did that day many noble feats of war.
<p/>And also Sir Cador told who of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knights were slain, as Sir Berel, and other Sir Moris and Sir Maurel, two good knights.
<p/>Then the king wept, and dried his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) eyes with a kerchief, and said, Your courage had near-hand destroyed you, for though ye had returned again, ye had lost no worship; for I call it folly, knights to abide when they be overmatched.
<p/>CHAPTER VII. Nay, said Launcelot and the other, for once shamed may never be recovered. CHAPTER VIII. How a senator told to Lucius of their discomfiture, and also of the great battle between Arthur and Lucius.
<p/>NOW leave we King Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) noble knights which had won the field, and had brought their prisoners to Paris, and speak we of a senator which escaped from the battle, and came to Lucius the emperor, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>), Sir emperor, I advise thee for to withdraw thee; what dost thou here?
<p/>thou shalt win nothing in these marches but great strokes out of all measure, for this day one of Arthur's knights was worth in the battle an hundred of ours.
<p/>Fie on thee, said Lucius, thou speakest cowardly; for thy words grieve me more than all the loss that I had this day.
<p/>And anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) sent forth a king, which hight Sir Leomie, with a great army, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) hie him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) fast to-fore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) would follow hastily after.
<p/>King Arthur was warned privily, and sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) people to Sessoine, and took up the towns and castles from the Romans.
<p/>Then the king commanded Sir Cador to take the rearward, and to take with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) certain knights of the Round Table, and Sir Launcelot, Sir Bors, Sir Kay, Sir Marrok, with Sir Marhaus, shall await on our person.
<p/>When the emperor was entered into the vale of Sessoine, he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) might see where King Arthur was embattled and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) banner displayed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was beset round about with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) enemies, that needs he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must fight or yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might not flee, but said openly unto the Romans, Sirs, I admonish you that this day ye fight and acquit you as men, and remember how Rome domineth and is chief and head over all the earth and universal world, and suffer not these Britons this day to abide against us; and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did command his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) trumpets to blow the bloody sounds, in such wise that the ground trembled and dindled.
<p/>Then the battles approached and shoved and shouted on both sides, and great strokes were smitten on both sides, many men overthrown, hurt, and slain; and great valiances, prowesses and appertices of war were that day showed, which were over long to recount the noble feats of every man, for they should contain an whole volume.
<p/>But in especial, King Arthur rode in the battle exhorting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights to do well, and himself did as nobly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands as was possible a man to do; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) drew out Excalibur his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sword, and awaited ever whereas the Romans were thickest and most grieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) people, and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) on that part, and hew and slew down right, and rescued his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) people; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) slew a great giant named Galapas, which was a man of an huge quantity and height, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shorted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and smote off both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs by the knees, saying, Now art thou better of a size to deal with than thou were, and after smote off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/>Thus the King Arthur disperpled his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) host in divers parties, to the end that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) enemies should not escape. There Sir Gawaine fought nobly and slew three admirals in that battle.
<p/>And so did all the knights of the Round Table. Thus the battle between King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor endured long.
<p/>And thus the battle was great, and oftsides that one party was at a fordeal and anon at an afterdeal, which endured so long till at the last King Arthur espied where Lucius the Emperor fought, and did wonder with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) own hands.
<p/>Lucius had on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) side many Saracens which were slain. And anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) rode to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>). And either smote other fiercely, and at last Lucius smote Arthur thwart the visage, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) a large wound.
<p/>And when King Arthur felt himself hurt, anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) again with Excalibur that it cleft his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) head, from the summit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) head, and stinted not till it came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) breast.
<p/>And when it was known that the emperor was slain, anon all the Romans with all their host put them to flight, and King Arthur with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights followed the chase, and slew down right all them that they might attain.
<p/>And thus was the victory given to King Arthur, and the triumph; and there were slain on the part of Lucius more than an hundred thousand.
<p/>And after King Arthur did do ransack the dead bodies, and did do bury them that were slain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) retinue,
<p/>And then the emperor fell down dead and there ended his (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) life. every man according to the estate and degree that he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) was of.
<p/>And them that were hurt he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) let the surgeons do search their hurts and wounds, and commanded to spare no salves nor medicines till they were whole.
<p/>Then the king rode straight to the place where the Emperor Lucius lay dead, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucius</b></font>) found slain the Soudan of Syria, the King of Egypt and of Ethiopia, which were two noble kings, with seventeen other kings of divers regions, and also sixty senators of Rome, all noble men, whom the king did do balm and gum with many good gums aromatic, and after did do cere them in sixty fold of cered cloth of sendal, and laid them in chests of lead, because they should not chafe nor savour, and upon all these bodies their shields with their arms and banners were set, to the end they should be known of what country they were.
<p/>And after he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) found three senators which were alive, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said, For to save your lives I will that ye take these dead bodies, and carry them with you unto great Rome, and present them to the Potestate on my behalf, shewing him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) my letters, and tell them that I in my person shall hastily be at Rome.
<p/>And I suppose the Romans shall beware how they shall demand any tribute of me. And I command you to say
<p/>when ye shall come to Rome, to the Potestate and all the Council and Senate, that I send to them these dead bodies for the tribute that they have demanded.
<p/>And if they be not content with these, I shall pay more at my coming, for other tribute owe I none, nor none other will I pay.
<p/>And furthermore, I charge you to say to them, that I command them upon pain of their heads never to demand tribute nor tax of me nor of my lands.
<p/>Then with this charge and commandment, the three senators aforesaid departed with all the said dead bodies, laying the body of Lucius in a car covered with the arms of the Empire all alone; and after alway two bodies of kings in a chariot, and then the bodies of the senators after them, and so went toward Rome, and showed their legation and message to the Potestate and Senate, recounting the battle done in France, and how the field was lost and much people and innumerable slain.
<p/>Wherefore they advised them in no wise to move no more war against that noble conqueror Arthur, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might and prowess is most to be doubted, seen the noble kings and great multitude of knights of the Round Table, to whom none earthly prince may compare.
<p/>And methinketh this sufficeth for Britain, Ireland and all Almaine with Germany. CHAPTER IX How Arthur, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had achieved the battle against the Romans, entered into Almaine, and so into Italy.
<p/>NOW turn we unto King Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) noble knights, which, after the great battle achieved against the Romans, entered into Lorraine, Brabant and Flanders, and sithen returned into Haut Almaine, and so over the mountains into Lombardy, and after, into Tuscany wherein was a city which in no wise would yield themself nor obey, wherefore King Arthur besieged it, and lay long about it, and gave many assaults to the city; and they within defended them valiantly.
<p/>Then, on a time, the king called Sir Florence, a knight, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) they lacked victual, And not far from hence be great forests and woods, wherein be many of mine enemies with much bestial:
<p/>I will that thou make thee ready and go thither in foraying, and take with thee Sir Gawaine my nephew, Sir Wisshard, Sir Clegis, Sir Cleremond, and the Captain of Cardiff with other, and bring with you all the beasts that ye there can get.
<p/>these knights made them ready, and rode over holts and hills, through forests and woods, till they came into a fair meadow full of fair flowers and grass; and there they rested them and their horses all that night.
<p/>And in the springing of the day in the next morn, Sir Gawaine took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse and stole away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fellowship, to seek some adventures.
<p/>And anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was ware of a man armed, walking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse easily by a wood's side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) shield laced to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) shoulder, sitting on a strong courser, without any man saving a page bearing a mighty spear.
<p/>When Sir Gawaine espied this gay knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) feutred his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) spear, and rode straight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) from whence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was.
<p/>That other answered and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was of Tuscany, and demanded of Sir Gawaine, What, profferest thou, proud knight, thee so boldly?
<p/>And anon The knight bare in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield three griffins of gold, in sable carbuncle, the chief of silver. here gettest thou no prey
<p/>Then said Gawaine, thou avauntest thee greatly and speakest proud words, I counsel thee for all thy boast that thou make thee ready, and take thy gear to thee, to-fore greater grame fall to thee.
<p/>, thou mayest prove what thou wilt, for thou shalt be my prisoner or thou depart. CHAPTER X. Of a battle done by Sir Gawaine against a Saracen, which after was yielden and became Christian.
<p/>THEN they took their spears and ran each at other with all the might they had, and smote each other through their shields into their shoulders, wherefore anon they pulled out their swords, and smote great strokes that the fire sprang out of their helms.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine was all abashed, and with Galatine his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) good sword he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) smote through shield and thick hauberk made of thick mails, and all to-rushed and break the precious stones, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) a large wound, that men might see both liver and lung.
<p/>Then groaned that knight, and addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to Sir Gawaine, and with an awk stroke gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) a great wound and cut a vein, which grieved Gawaine sore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) bled sore.
<p/>Then the knight said to Sir Gawaine, bind thy wound or thy blee-LSB-ding-RSB- change, for thou be-bleedest all thy horse and thy fair arms, for all the barbers of Brittany shall not con staunch thy blood, for whosomever is hurt with this blade he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) shall never be staunched of bleeding.
<p/>Then answered Gawaine, it grieveth me but little, thy great words shall not fear me nor lessen my courage, but thou shalt suffer teen and sorrow or we depart, but tell me in haste who may staunch my bleeding.
<p/>That may I do, said the knight, if I will, and so will I if thou wilt succour and aid me, that I may be christened and believe on God,
<p/>I grant, said Gawaine, so God help me, to accomplish all thy desire, but first tell me what thou soughtest here thus alone, and of what land and liegiance thou art of.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) said, my name is Priamus, and a great prince is my father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) hath been rebel unto Rome and overridden many of their lands.
<p/>and thereof I require thee of thy manhood, and it shall be great merit for thy soul. My father is lineally descended of Alexander and of Hector by right line.
<p/>I am right inheritor of Alexandria and Africa, and all the out isles, yet will I believe on thy Lord that thou believest on; and for thy labour I shall give thee treasure enough.
<p/>And Duke Joshua and Maccabaeus were of our lineage. I was so elate and hauteyn in my heart that I thought no man my peer, nor to me semblable.
<p/>I was sent into this war with seven score knights, and now I have encountered with thee, which hast given to me of fighting my fill, wherefore sir knight
<p/>I am no knight, said Gawaine, I have been brought up in the guardrobe with the noble King Arthur many years, for to take heed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) armour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) other array, and to point his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) paltocks that long to himself.
<p/>At Yule last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) made me yeoman, and gave to me horse and harness, and an hundred pound in money; and if fortune be my friend, I doubt not but to be well advanced and holpen by my liege lord.
<p/>Ah, said Priamus, if his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knaves be so keen and fierce, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knights be passing good: now for the King's love of Heaven, whether thou be a knave or a knight, tell thou me thy name.
<p/>By God, said Sir Gawaine, now I will say thee sooth, my name is Sir Gawaine, and known I am in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) court and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) chamber, and one of the knights of the Round Table
<p/>Therefore grudge not if this grace is to me fortuned, it is the goodness of God that lent to me my strength.
<p/>, I pray thee to tell me what thou art. , he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dubbed me a duke with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own hand. Now am I better pleased, said Priamus, than thou hadst given to me all the Provence and Paris the rich.
<p/>I had liefer to have been torn with wild horses, than any varlet had won such loos, or any page or priker should have had prize on me.
<p/>But now sir knight I warn thee that hereby is a Duke of Lorraine with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) army, and the noblest men of Dolphiny, and lords of Lombardy, with the garrison of Godard, and Saracens of Southland, y-numbered sixty thousand of good men of arms; wherefore but if we hie us hence, it will harm us both, for we be sore hurt, never like to recover; but take heed to my page, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Godard</b></font>) no horn blow, for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Godard</b></font>) do, there be hoving here fast by an hundred knights awaiting on my person, and if they take thee, there shall no ransom of gold nor silver acquit thee.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine rode over a water for to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and the knight followed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and so rode forth till they came to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fellows which were in the meadow, where they had been all the night.
<p/>Anon as Sir Wisshard was ware of Sir Gawaine and saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was hurt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sorrowfully weeping, and demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) who had so hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); and Gawaine told how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) had foughten with that man, and each of them had hurt other, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) had salves to heal them; but I can tell you other tidings, that soon we shall have ado with many enemies.
<p/>Then Sir Priamus and Sir Gawaine alighted, and let their horses graze in the meadow, and unarmed them, and then the blood ran freshly from their wounds.
<p/>And Priamus took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) page a vial full of the four waters that came out of Paradise, and with certain balm anointed their wounds, and washed them with that water, and within an hour after they were both as whole as ever they were.
<p/>And then with a trumpet were they all assembled to council, and there Priamus told unto them what lords and knights had sworn to rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and that without fail they should be assailed with many thousands, wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) counselled them to withdraw them.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine said, it were great shame to them to avoid without any strokes; Wherefore I advise to take our arms and to make us ready to meet with these Saracens and misbelieving men, and with the help of God we shall overthrow them and have a fair day on them.
<p/>And Sir Florence shall abide still in this field to keep the stale as a noble knight, and we shall not forsake yonder fellows.
<p/>for I warn you ye shall find in yonder woods many perilous knights; they will put forth beasts to call you on, they be out of number, and ye are not past seven hundred, which be over few to fight with so many.
<p/>Nevertheless, said Sir Gawaine, we shall once encounter them, and see what they can do, and the best shall have the victory.
<p/>Now, said Priamus, cease your words, CHAPTER XI. How the Saracens came out of a wood for to rescue their beasts, and of a great battle.
<p/>Then followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) seven hundred men of arms; and Sir Ferant of Spain on a fair steed came springing out of the woods, and came to Sir Florence and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fled.
<p/>Then Sir Florence took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) spear and rode against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) in the forehead and brake his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) neck bone.
<p/>Then all the other were moved, and thought to avenge the death of Sir Ferant, and smote in among them, and there was great fight, and many slain and laid down to ground, and Sir Florence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) hundred knights alway kept the stale, and fought manly.
<p/>Then when Priamus the good knight perceived the great fight, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went to Sir Gawaine, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) should go and succour his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fellowship, which were sore bestead with their enemies.
<p/>THEN Sir Florence called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) Sir Floridas, with an hundred knights, and drove forth the herd of beasts. Sir, grieve you not, said Sir Gawaine, for their gree shall be theirs.
<p/>I shall not once move my horse to them ward, but if I see more than there be; for they be strong enough to match them.
<p/>And with that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) saw an earl called Sir Ethelwold and the duke of Dutchmen, came leaping out of a wood with many thousands, and Priamus' knights, and came straight unto the battle.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine comforted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) knights, and bade them not to be abashed, for all shall be ours. Then they began to wallop and met with their enemies, there were men slain and overthrown on every side.
<p/>Then thrust in among them the knights of the Table Round, and smote down to the earth all them that withstood them, in so much that they made them to recoil and flee.
<p/>Then entered into the battle Jubance a giant, and fought and slew down right, and distressed many of our knights, among whom was slain Sir Gherard, a knight of Wales.
<p/>By God, said Sir Gawaine, this gladdeth my heart, for now be they less in number by twenty thousand. Then our knights took heart to them, and slew many Saracens.
<p/>And then came in Sir Priamus with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) pennon, and rode with the knights of the Round Table, and fought so manfully that many of their enemies lost their lives.
<p/>And there Sir Priamus slew the Marquis of Moises land, and Sir Gawaine with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fellows so quit them that they had the field, but in that stour was Sir Chestelaine, a child and ward of Sir Gawaine slain, wherefore was much sorrow made, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) death was soon avenged.
<p/>Then Sir Florence and Sir Gawaine harboured surely their people, and took great plenty of bestial, of gold and silver, and great treasure and riches, and returned unto King Arthur, which lay still at the siege.
<p/>And when they came to the king they presented their prisoners and recounted their adventures, and how they had vanquished their enemies.
<p/>How Sir Gawaine returned to King Arthur with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) prisoners, and how the King won a city, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was crowned Emperor.
<p/>Thus was the battle ended, and many lords of Lombardy and Saracens left dead in the field. CHAPTER XII. NOW thanked be God, said the noble King Arthur.
<p/>Sir, said Gawaine, this is a good man of arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) hath matched me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) is yielden unto God, and to me, for to become Christian; had not he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) have been we should never have returned, wherefore
<p/>But what manner man is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that standeth by himself, him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemeth no prisoner. I pray you that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be baptised, for there
<p/>Then the king let him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) anon be christened, and did do call him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) first name Priamus, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) a duke and knight of the Table Round.
<p/>And then anon the king let do cry assault to the city, and there was rearing of ladders, breaking of walls, and the ditch filled, that men with little pain might enter into the city.
<p/>Then came out a duchess, and Clarisin the countess, with many ladies and damosels, and kneeling before King Arthur, required him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) for the love of God to receive the city, and not to take it by assault, for then should many guiltless be slain.
<p/>Then the king avaled his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) visor with a meek and noble countenance, and said, Madam, there shall none of my subjects misdo you nor your maidens, nor to none that to you belong, but the duke shall abide my judgment.
<p/>Then anon the king commanded to leave the assault, and anon the duke's oldest son brought out the keys, and kneeling delivered them to the king, and besought him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of grace; and the king seized the town by assent of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lords, and took the duke and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to Dover, there for to abide prisoner term of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) life, and assigned certain rents for the dower of the duchess and for her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) children.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) made lords to rule those lands, and laws as a lord ought to do in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own country; and after he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) journey toward Rome, and sent Sir Floris and Sir Floridas to-fore, with five hundred men of arms, and they came to the city of Urbino and laid there a bushment, thereas them seemed most best for them, and rode to-fore the town, where anon issued out much people and skirmished with the fore-riders.
<p/>Then brake out the bushment and won the bridge, and after the town, and set upon the walls the king's banner.
<p/>Then came the king upon an hill, and saw the city and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) banner on the walls, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knew that the city was won.
<p/>And anon he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sent and commanded that none of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) liege men should defoul nor lie by no lady, wife nor maid; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came into the city, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) passed to the castle, and comforted them that were in sorrow, and ordained there a captain, a knight of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own country.
<p/>And when they of Milan heard that thilk city was won, they sent to King Arthur great sums of money, and besought him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) as their lord to have pity on them, promising to be his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) subjects for ever, and yield to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) homage and fealty for the lands of Pleasance and Pavia, Petersaint, and the Port of Tremble, and to give him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) yearly a million of gold all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lifetime.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rideth into Tuscany, and winneth towns and castles, and wasted all in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) way that to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will not obey, and so to Spolute and Viterbe, and from thence he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rode into the Vale of Vicecount among the vines.
<p/>liveth not a nobler man nor better knight of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hands. And from thence he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sent to the senators, to wit whether they would know him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) for their lord.
<p/>But soon after on a Saturday came unto King Arthur all the senators that were left alive, and the noblest cardinals that then dwelt in Rome, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) of peace, and proferred him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) full large, and besought him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) as governor to give licence for six weeks for to assemble all the Romans, and then to crown him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) emperor with chrism as it belongeth to so high estate.
<p/>I assent, said the king, like as ye have devised, and at Christmas there to be crowned, and to hold my Round Table with my knights as me liketh.
<p/>And at the day appointed, as the romance telleth, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came into Rome, and was crowned emperor by the pope's hand, with all the royalty that could be made, and sojourned there a time, and established all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lands from Rome into France, and gave lands and realms unto his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) servants and knights, to everych after his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) desert, in such wise that none complained, rich nor poor.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) gave to Sir Priamus the duchy of Lorraine; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life; and after made dukes and earls, and made every man rich.
<p/>Then after this all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knights and lords assembled them afore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and said: Blessed be God, your war is finished and your conquest achieved, in so much that we know none so great nor mighty that dare make war against you: wherefore we beseech you to return homeward, and give us licence to go home to our wives, from whom we have been long, and to rest us, for your journey is finished with honour and worship.
<p/>And then the senators made ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) enthronization. Then said the king, Ye say truth, and for to tempt God
<p/>it is no wisdom, and therefore make you ready and return we into England. Then there was trussing of harness and baggage and great carriage.
<p/>And after licence given, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) returned and commanded that no man in pain of death should not rob nor take victual, nor other thing by the way but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should pay therefore.
<p/>And thus he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came over the sea and landed at Sandwich, against whom Queen Guenever his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife came and met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was nobly received of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) commons in every city and burgh, and great gifts presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home-coming to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with.
<p/>Thus endeth the fifth book of the conquest that King Arthur had against Lucius the Emperor of Rome, and here followeth the sixth book, which is of Sir Launcelot du Lake.
<p/>BOOK VI. CHAPTER I. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel departed from the court, and how Sir Lionel left him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) sleeping and was taken.
<p/>SOON after that King Arthur was come from Rome into England, then all the knights of the Table Round resorted unto the king, and made many jousts and tournaments, and some there were that were but knights, which increased so in arms and worship that they passed all their fellows in prowess and noble deeds, and that was well proved on many; but in especial it was proved on Sir Launcelot du Lake, for in all tournaments and jousts and deeds of arms, both for life and death, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) passed all other knights, and at no time he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was never overcome but if it were by treason or enchantment; so Sir Launcelot increased so marvellously in worship, and in honour, therefore is he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the first knight that the French book maketh mention of after King Arthur came from Rome.
<p/>Wherefore Queen Guenever had him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in great favour above all other knights, and in certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) loved the queen again above all other ladies and damosels of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) life, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did many deeds of arms, and saved her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) from the fire through his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) noble chivalry.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thought himself to prove himself in strange adventures, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bade his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nephew, Sir Lionel, for to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ready; for we two will seek adventures.
<p/>So they mounted on their horses, armed at all rights, and rode into a deep forest and so into a deep plain.
<p/>Thus Sir Launcelot rested him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) long with play and game. And then the weather was hot about noon, and Sir Launcelot had great lust to sleep.
<p/>Then Sir Lionel espied a great apple-tree that stood by an hedge, and said, Brother, yonder is a fair shadow, there may we rest us -LSB-and-RSB- our horses.
<p/>It is well said, fair brother, said Sir Launcelot, for this eight year I was not so sleepy as I am now;
<p/>and so they there alighted and tied their horses unto sundry trees, and so Sir Launcelot laid him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) down under an appletree, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) helm he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) laid under his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head.
<p/>And Sir Lionel waked while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) slept. So Sir Launcelot was asleep passing fast. And in the meanwhile there came three knights riding, as fast fleeing as ever they might ride.
<p/>And when Sir Lionel saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>), him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) saw never so great a knight, nor so well faring a man, neither so well apparelled unto all rights.
<p/>So within a while this strong knight had overtaken one of these knights, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to the cold earth that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lay still.
<p/>And there followed them three but one knight. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode unto the second knight, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) so that man and horse fell down.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alighted down and reined his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse on the bridle, and bound all the three knights fast with the reins of their own bridles.
<p/>When Sir Lionel saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) do thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) thought to assay him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) ready, and stilly and privily he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) horse, and thought not for to awake Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) was mounted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) overtook this strong knight, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) turn, and the other smote Sir Lionel so hard that horse and man he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) bare to the earth, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) alighted down and bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) fast, and threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) overthwart his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) own horse, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) served them all four, and rode with them away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) own castle.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) came there he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) gart unarm them, and beat them with thorns all naked, and after put them in a deep prison where were many more knights, that made great dolour.
<p/>And then straight to the third knight he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) behind his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse's arse a spear length. CHAPTER II.
<p/>WHEN Sir Ector de Maris wist that Sir Launcelot was passed out of the court to seek adventures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) was wroth with himself, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) ready to seek Sir Launcelot, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) had ridden long in a great forest he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) met with a man was like a forester.
<p/>How Sir Ector followed for to seek Sir Launcelot, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) was taken by Sir Turquine. Fair fellow, said Sir Ector, knowest thou in this country any adventures that be here nigh hand?
<p/>Sir, said the forester, this country know I well, and hereby, within this mile, is a strong manor, and well dyked, and by that manor, on the left hand, there is a fair ford for horses to drink of, and over that ford there groweth a fair tree, and thereon hang many fair shields that wielded sometime good knights, and at the hole of the tree hangeth a basin of copper and latten, and strike upon that basin with the butt of thy spear thrice, and soon after thou shalt hear new tidings, and else hast thou the fairest grace that many a year had ever knight that passed through this forest.
<p/>And among them he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brother's shield, Sir Lionel, and many more that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) knew that were his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) fellows of the Round Table, the which grieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) heart, and promised to revenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Then anon Sir Ector beat on the basin as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) were wood, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) horse drink at the ford, and there came a knight behind him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) come out of the water and make him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ready; and Sir Ector anon turned him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shortly, and in feuter cast his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear, and smote the other knight a great buffet that his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse turned twice about.
<p/>This was well done, said the strong knight, and knightly thou hast stricken me; and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rushed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse on Sir Ector, and cleight him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) right arm, and bare him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) clean out of the saddle, and rode with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) away into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) own hall, and threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) down in midst of the floor.
<p/>Gramercy, said Sir Ector, and departed and came to the tree, and saw many fair shields. The name of this knight was Sir Turquine.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said unto Sir Ector, For thou hast done this day more unto me than any knight did these twelve years, now will I grant thee thy life, so thou wilt be sworn to be my prisoner all thy life days.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Ector, that will I never promise thee, but that I will do mine advantage. That me repenteth, said Sir Turquine.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) gart to unarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>), and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) with thorns all naked, and sithen put him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) down in a deep dungeon, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) knew many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) fellows.
<p/>But when Sir Ector saw Sir Lionel, then made he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) great sorrow. Alas, brother, said Sir Ector, where is my brother Sir Launcelot?
<p/>Fair brother, I left him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) asleep when that I from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) yode, under an apple-tree, and what is become of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) I cannot tell you.
<p/>Alas, said the knights, but Sir Launcelot help us we may never be delivered, for we know now no knight that is able to match our master Turquine.
<p/>CHAPTER III How four queens found Launcelot sleeping, and how by enchantment he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was taken and led into a castle. NOW leave we these knights prisoners, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du Lake that lieth under the apple-tree sleeping.
<p/>Even about the noon there came by him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) four queens of great estate; and, for the heat should not annoy them, there rode four knights about them, and bare a cloth of green silk on four spears, betwixt them and the sun, and the queens rode on four white mules.
<p/>Thus as they rode they heard by them a great horse grimly neigh, then were they ware of a sleeping knight
<p/>, that lay all armed under an apple-tree; anon as these queens looked on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) face, they knew it was Sir Launcelot.
<p/>We shall not strive, said Morgan le Fay, that was King Arthur's sister, I shall put an enchantment upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) shall not awake in six hours, and then I will lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) away unto my castle, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) is surely within my hold, I shall take the enchantment from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>), and then let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) choose which of us he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) will have unto paramour.
<p/>So this enchantment was cast upon Sir Launcelot, and then they laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) shield, and bare him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) so on horseback betwixt two knights, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) unto the castle Chariot, and there they laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) in a chamber cold, and at night they sent unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) a fair damosel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) supper ready dight.
<p/>Then they began for to strive for that knight, everych one said they would have him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) love. By that the enchantment was past, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) came she (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) what cheer.
<p/>I cannot say, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, for I wot not how I came into this castle but it be by an enchantment.
<p/>Sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>), ye must make good cheer, and if ye be such a knight as it is said ye be, I shall tell you more to-morn by prime of the day.
<p/>Gramercy, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, of your good will I require you. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) departed. And there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lay all that night without comfort of anybody.
<p/>And on the morn early came these four queens, passingly well beseen, all they bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) good morn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) them again.
<p/>Sir knight, the four queens said, thou must understand thou art our prisoner, and we here know thee well that thou art Sir Launcelot du Lake, King Ban's son, and because we understand your worthiness, that thou art the noblest knight living, and as we know
<p/>well there can no lady have thy love but one, and that is Queen Guenever, and now thou shalt lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) for ever, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) thee, and therefore thee behoveth now to choose one of us four.
<p/>I am the Queen Morgan le Fay, queen of the land of Gore, and here is the queen of Northgalis, and the queen of Eastland, and the queen of the Out Isles; now choose one of us which thou wilt have to thy paramour, for thou mayest not choose or else in this prison to die.
<p/>had I liefer to die in this prison with worship, than to have one of you to my paramour maugre my head.
<p/>And therefore ye be answered, I will none of you, for ye be false enchantresses, and as for my lady, Dame Guenever, were I at my liberty as I was, I would prove it on you or on yours, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is the truest lady unto her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord living.
<p/>This is an hard case, said Sir Launcelot, that either I must die or else choose one of you, yet Well, said the queens, is this your answer, that ye will refuse us.
<p/>Yea, on my life, said Sir Launcelot, refused ye be of me. So they departed and left him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) there alone that made great sorrow.
<p/>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot was delivered by the mean of a damosel. RIGHT so at the noon came the damosel unto him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) dinner, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) what cheer.
<p/>Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, that me repenteth, but an ye will be ruled by me, I shall help you out of this distress, and ye shall have no shame nor villainy, so that ye hold me a promise.
<p/>Fair damosel, I will grant you, and sore I am of these queen-sorceresses afeard, for they have destroyed many a good knight.
<p/>Sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), that is sooth, and for the renown and bounty that they hear of you they would have your love, and Sir, they say, your name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, the flower of knights, and they be passing wroth with you that ye have refused them.
<p/>But Sir, an ye would promise me to help my father on Tuesday next coming, that hath made a tournament betwixt him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and the King of Northgalis--for the last Tuesday past my father lost the field through three knights of Arthur's court--an ye will be there on Tuesday next coming, and help my father, to-morn or prime, by the grace of God, I shall deliver you clean.
<p/>Truly, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, in my life days never so ill. Fair maiden, said Sir Launcelot, tell me what is your father's name, and then shall I give you an answer.
<p/>I know your father well, said Sir Launcelot, for a noble king and a good knight, and by the faith of my body, ye shall have my body ready to do your father and you
<p/>Sir knight, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, my father is King Bagdemagus, that was foul rebuked at the last tournament. service at that day.
<p/>and I shall be she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that shall deliver you and take you your armour and your horse, shield and spear, and hereby within this ten mile, is an abbey of white monks
<p/>Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, gramercy, and to-morn await ye be ready betimes , there I pray you that ye me abide, and thither shall I bring my father unto you.
<p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) departed, and came on the morn early, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ready; then she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out of twelve locks, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unto his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) armour, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was clean armed, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) until his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own horse, and lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saddled him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and took a great spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand and so rode forth, and said, Fair damosel, I shall not fail you, by the grace of God.
<p/>All this shall be done, said Sir Launcelot as I am true knight. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode into a great forest all that day, and never could find no highway
<p/>and so the night fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and then was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ware in a slade, of a pavilion of red sendal.
<p/>By my faith, said Sir Launcelot, in that pavilion will I lodge all this night, and so there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) alighted down, and tied his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse to the pavilion, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) unarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) found a bed, and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) therein and fell asleep sadly.
<p/>CHAPTER V. How a knight found Sir Launcelot lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) leman's bed, and how Sir Launcelot fought with the knight.
<p/>THEN within an hour there came the knight to whom the pavilion ought, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) weened that his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) leman had lain in that bed, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) laid him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) down beside Sir Launcelot, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) arms and began to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And when Sir Launcelot felt a rough beard kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) started out of the bed lightly, and the other knight after him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and either of them gat their swords in their hands, and out at the pavilion door went the knight of the pavilion, and Sir Launcelot followed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and there by a little slake Sir Launcelot wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sore, nigh unto the death.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) unto Sir Launcelot, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) granted him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came into the bed.
<p/>Sir, said the knight, the pavilion is mine own, and there this night I had assigned my lady to have slept with me, and now I am likely to die of this wound.
<p/>That me repenteth, said Launcelot, of your hurt, but I was adread of treason, for I was late beguiled, and therefore come on your way into your pavilion and take your rest, and as I suppose I shall staunch your blood.
<p/>that was a passing fair lady, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) espied that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord Belleus was sore wounded, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried out on Sir Launcelot, and made great dole out of measure.
<p/>Peace, my lady and my love, said Belleus, for this knight is a good man, and a knight adventurous, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) all the cause how he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was wounded; And when that I yielded me unto him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) left me goodly and hath staunched my blood.
<p/>And so they went both into the pavilion, and anon Sir Launcelot staunched his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) blood. Therewithal came the knight's lady, Sir, said the lady, I require thee tell me what knight
<p/>So me thought ever by your speech, said the lady, for I have seen you oft or this, and I know you better than ye ween.
<p/>But now an ye would promise me of your courtesy, for the harms that ye have done to me and my Lord Belleus, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Belleus</b></font>) cometh unto Arthur's court for to cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Belleus</b></font>) to be made knight of the Round Table, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is a passing good man of arms, and a mighty lord of lands of many out isles.
<p/>Fair lady, said Sir Launcelot, let him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) come unto the court the next high feast, and look that ye come with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), and I shall do my power,
<p/>ye be, and what is your name? Fair lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. an ye prove you doughty of your hands, that ye shall have your desire.
<p/>So thus within a while, as they thus talked, the night passed, and the day shone, and then Sir Launcelot armed him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) horse, and they taught him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to the Abbey, and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) rode within the space of two hours.
<p/>AND soon as Sir Launcelot came within the abbey yard, the daughter of King Bagdemagus heard a great horse go on the pavement.
<p/>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot was received of King Bagdemagus' daughter, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) complaint to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) then arose and yede unto a window, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) saw Sir Launcelot, and anon
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) made men fast to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) horse from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) and let lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) into a stable, and himself was led into a fair chamber, and unarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>), and the lady sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) a long gown, and anon
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came herself. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made Launcelot passing good cheer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) was the knight in the world
<p/>was most welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Then in all haste she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father Bagdemagus that was within twelve mile of that Abbey, and afore
<p/>even he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) came, with a fair fellowship of knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>). And when the king was alighted off his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) yode straight unto Sir Launcelot's chamber
<p/>and there he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) daughter, and then the king embraced Sir Launcelot in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) arms, and either made other good cheer.
<p/>Anon Sir Launcelot made his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) complaint unto the king how he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was betrayed, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) brother Sir Lionel was departed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>)
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) wist not where, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) daughter had delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) out of prison; Therefore while I live I shall do her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) service and all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) kindred.
<p/>Then am I sure of your help, said the king, on Tuesday next coming. Yea, sir, said Sir Launcelot, I shall not fail you, for so
<p/>I have promised my lady your daughter. But, sir, what knights be they of my lord Arthur's that were with the King of Northgalis?
<p/>And the king said it was Sir Mador de la Porte, and Sir Mordred and Sir Gahalantine that all for-fared my knights, for against them
<p/>Sir, said Sir Launcelot, as I hear say that the tournament shall be here within this three mile of this abbey, ye shall send unto me three knights of yours, such as ye trust, and look that the three knights have all white shields, and I also, and no painture on the shields, and we four will come out of a little wood in midst of both parties, and we shall fall in the front of our enemies and grieve them that we may; and thus shall I not be known what knight I am.
<p/>So they took their rest that night, and this was on the Sunday, and so the king departed, and sent unto Sir Launcelot three knights with the four white shields.
<p/>three I nor my knights might bear no strength. And on the Tuesday they lodged them in a little leaved wood beside there
<p/>the tournament should be. And there were scaffolds and holes that lords and ladies might behold and to give the prize.
<p/>Then came into the field the King of Northgalis with eight score helms. And then the three knights of Arthur's stood by themselves.
<p/>And then they feutred their spears, and came together with a great dash, and there were slain of knights at the first recounter twelve of King Bagdemagus' party, and six of the King of Northgalis' party, and King Bagdemagus' party was far set aback.
<p/>Then came into the field King Bagdemagus with four score of helms. CHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot behaved him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) in a tournament, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) met with Sir Turquine leading Sir Gaheris.
<p/>WITH that came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) thrust in with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spear in the thickest of the press, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) smote down with one spear five knights, and of four of them he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) brake their backs.
<p/>And in that throng he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) smote down the King of Northgalis, and brake his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) thigh in that fall. All this doing of Sir Launcelot saw the three knights of Arthur's.
<p/>Yonder is a shrewd guest, said Sir Mador de la Porte, therefore have here once at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). So they encountered, and Sir Launcelot bare him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) down horse and man, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shoulder went out of lith.
<p/>Sir Launcelot was ware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and gat a great spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand, and met him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and Sir Mordred brake a spear upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and Sir Launcelot gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) such a buffet that the arson of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saddle brake, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) flew over his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse's tail, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) helm butted into the earth a foot and more, that nigh his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) neck was broken, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lay long in a swoon.
<p/>Then came in Sir Gahalantine with a great spear and Launcelot against him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), with all their strength that they might drive, that both their spears to-brast even to their hands, and then they flang out with their swords and gave many a grim stroke.
<p/>Then was Sir Launcelot wroth out of measure, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) smote Sir Gahalantine on the helm that his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nose brast out on blood, and ears and mouth both, and therewith his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) head hung low.
<p/>Now befalleth it to me to joust, said Mordred, for Sir Mador hath a sore fall. And therewith his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse ran away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fell down to the earth.
<p/>Anon therewithal Sir Launcelot gat a great spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand, and or ever that great spear brake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bare down to the earth sixteen knights, some horse and man, and some the man and not the horse, and there was none but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hit surely, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bare none arms that day.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gat another great spear, and smote down twelve knights, and the most part of them never throve after.
<p/>And then the knights of the King of Northgalis would joust no more. And there the gree was given to King Bagdemagus.
<p/>So either party departed unto his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) own place, and Sir Launcelot rode forth with King Bagdemagus unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) castle, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) had passing good cheer both with the king and with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) daughter, and they proffered him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) great gifts.
<p/>And on the morn he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) leave, and told the king that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would go and seek his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) brother Sir Lionel, that went from him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) when that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) slept, so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse, and betaught them all to God.
<p/>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said unto the king's daughter, If ye have need any time of my service I pray you let me have knowledge, and I shall not fail you as I am true knight.
<p/>And in the midst of a highway he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) met a damosel riding on a white palfrey, and there either saluted other.
<p/>And so Sir Launcelot departed, and by adventure he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came into the same forest there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was taken sleeping. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, know
<p/>ye in this country any adventures? Sir knight, said that damosel, here are adventures near hand, an thou durst prove them.
<p/>Well, said she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), thou seemest well to be a good knight, and if thou dare meet with a good knight, I shall bring thee where is the best knight, and the mightiest that ever thou found, so thou wilt tell me what is thy name, and what knight thou art.
<p/>Why should I not prove adventures? said Sir Launcelot for that cause come I hither. Damosel, as for to tell thee my name
<p/>Sir, thou beseemest well, here be adventures by that fall for thee, for hereby dwelleth a knight that will not be overmatched for no man I know
<p/>I take no great force; truly my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. but ye overmatch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name is Sir Turquine.
<p/>And, as I understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hath in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prison, of Arthur's court, good knights three score and four, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hath won with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hands.
<p/>But when ye have done that journey ye shall promise me as ye are a true knight for to go with me, and to help me and other damosels that are distressed daily with a false knight.
<p/>Now, fair knight, come on your way; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) unto the ford and the tree where hung the basin.
<p/>So Sir Launcelot let his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse drink, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) beat on the basin with the butt of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear so hard with all his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might till the bottom fell out, and long he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw nothing.
<p/>All your intent, damosel, and desire I will fulfil, so ye will bring me unto this knight. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode endlong the gates of that manor nigh half-an-hour.
<p/>And then was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ware of a great knight that drove an horse afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and overthwart the horse there lay an armed knight bound.
<p/>And ever as they came near and near, Sir Launcelot thought he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should know him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). Then Sir Launcelot was ware that it was Sir Gaheris, Gawaine's brother, a knight of the Table Round.
<p/>Now, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I see yonder cometh a knight fast bounden that is a fellow of mine, and brother he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is unto Sir Gawaine.
<p/>And at the first beginning I promise you, by the leave of God, to rescue that knight; but if his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) master sit better in the saddle I shall deliver all the prisoners that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath out of danger, for I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath two brethren of mine prisoners with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Now, fair knight, said Sir Launcelot, put that wounded knight off the horse, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rest awhile, and let us two prove our strengths; for as it is informed me, thou doest and hast done great despite and shame unto knights of the Round Table, and therefore now defend thee.
<p/>By that time that either had seen other, they gripped their spears unto them. An thou be of the Table Round, said Turquine, I defy thee and all thy fellowship.
<p/>AND then they put their spears in the rests, and came together with their horses as fast as they might run, and either smote other in midst of their shields, that both their horses' backs brast under them, and the knights were both stonied.
<p/>And as soon as they might avoid their horses, they took their shields afore them, and drew out their swords, and came together eagerly, and either gave other many strong strokes, for there might neither shields nor harness hold their strokes.
<p/>That is overmuch said, said Sir Launcelot. CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Turquine fought together. And so within a while they had both grimly wounds, and bled passing grievously.
<p/>Thus they fared two hours or more trasing and rasing either other, where they might hit any bare place. Then at the last they were breathless both, and stood leaning on their swords.
<p/>Then Turquine said, Thou art the biggest man that ever I met withal, and the best breathed, and like one knight that I hate above all other knights; so be it that thou be not he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)
<p/>I will lightly accord with thee, and for thy love I will deliver all the prisoners that I have, that is three score and four, so thou wilt tell me thy name.
<p/>Now fellow, said Sir Turquine, hold thy hand a while, and tell me what I shall ask thee. Say on. And thou
<p/>and I we will be fellows together, and never to fail thee while that I live. It is well said, said Sir Launcelot, but sithen it is so that I may have thy friendship
<p/>Faithfully, said Sir Turquine, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) slew my brother, Sir Carados, at the dolorous tower, that was one of the best knights alive; and therefore him (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>)
<p/>I except of all knights, for may I once meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>), the one of us shall make an end of other, I make mine avow.
<p/>And for Sir Launcelot's sake I have slain an hundred good knights, and as many I have maimed all utterly that they might never after help themselves, and many have died in prison, and yet have I three score and four, and all shall be delivered so thou wilt tell me thy name, so be it that thou be not Sir Launcelot.
<p/>Now, see I well, said Sir Launcelot, that such a man I might be, I might have peace, and such a man I might be, that there should be war mortal betwixt us.
<p/>And now, sir knight, at thy request I will that thou wit and know that I am Launcelot du Lake, King Ban's son of Benwick, and very knight of the Table Round.
<p/>, what knight is he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that thou so hatest above all other? And now I defy thee, and do thy best.
<p/>Ah, said Turquine, Launcelot, thou art unto me most welcome that ever was knight, for we shall never depart till the one of us be dead.
<p/>Then they hurtled together as two wild bulls rushing and lashing with their shields and swords, that sometime they fell both over their noses.
<p/>Thus they fought still two hours and more, and never would have rest, and Sir Turquine gave Sir Launcelot many wounds that all the ground thereas they fought was all bespeckled with blood.
<p/>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Turquine was slain, and how Sir Launcelot bade Sir Gaheris deliver all the prisoners. THEN at the last Sir Turquine waxed faint, and gave somewhat aback, and bare his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) shield low for weariness.
<p/>That espied Sir Launcelot, and leapt upon him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) fiercely and gat him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) by the beaver of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) helmet, and plucked him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) down on his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knees, and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) raced off his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) helm, and smote his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) neck in sunder.
<p/>And when Sir Launcelot had done this, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) yode unto the damosel and said, Damosel, I am ready to go with you where ye will have me, but I have no horse.
<p/>Fair sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), take this wounded knight's horse and send him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) into this manor, and command him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to deliver all the prisoners.
<p/>Nay, fair lord, said Gaheris, I will that ye take my horse at your own commandment, for ye have both saved me and my horse, and
<p/>this day I say ye are the best knight in the world, for ye have slain this day in my sight the mightiest man and the best knight except you that ever I saw, and, fair sir, said Gaheris, I pray you tell me your name.
<p/>Sir, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, that ought to help you of right for King Arthur's sake, and in especial for my lord Sir Gawaine's sake, your own dear brother; and when that ye come within yonder manor, I am sure ye shall find there many knights of the Round Table, for I have seen many of their shields that I know on yonder tree.
<p/>There is Kay's shield, and Sir Brandel's shield, and Sir Marhaus' shield, and Sir Galind's shield, and Sir Brian de Listnois' shield, and Sir Aliduke's shield, with many more that I am not now advised of, and also my two brethren's shields, Sir Ector de Maris and Sir Lionel; wherefore I pray you greet them all from me, and say that I bid them take such stuff there as they find, and that in any wise my brethren go unto the court and abide me there till that I come, for by the feast of Pentecost
<p/>I cast me to be there, for as at this time I must ride with this damosel for to save my promise.
<p/>So Sir Launcelot went unto Gaheris, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) not to be aggrieved for to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) horse. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) departed from Gaheris, and Gaheris yede in to the manor, and
<p/>Anon withal Sir Gaheris threw the porter unto the ground and took the keys from him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>), and hastily he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) opened the prison door, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) let out all the prisoners, and every man loosed other of their bonds.
<p/>there he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) found a yeoman porter keeping there many keys. And when they saw Sir Gaheris, all they thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>), for they weened that he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was wounded.
<p/>Not so, said Gaheris, it was Launcelot that slew him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) worshipfully with his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) own hands. I saw it with mine own eyes.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) greeteth you all well, and prayeth you to haste you to the court; and as unto Sir Lionel and Ector de Maris
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) prayeth you to abide him (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) at the court. That shall we not do, says his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) brethren, we will find him (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) an we may live.
<p/>Then all those knights sought the house thereas the armour was, and then they armed them, and every knight found his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own horse, and all that ever longed unto him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>So shall I, said Sir Kay, find him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) or I come at the court, as I am true knight. And when this was done, there came a forester with four horses laden with fat venison.
<p/>Anon, Sir Kay said, Here is good meat for us for one meal, for we had not many a day no good repast.
<p/>And so that venison was roasted, baken, and sodden, and so after supper some abode there all night, but Sir Lionel and Ector de Maris and Sir Kay rode after Sir Launcelot to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) if they might.
<p/>How Sir Launcelot rode with a damosel and slew a knight that distressed all ladies and also a villain that kept a bridge.
<p/>Sir, said the damosel, here by this way haunteth a knight that distressed all ladies and gentlewomen, and at the least he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) robbeth them or lieth by them.
<p/>CHAPTER X. NOW turn we unto Sir Launcelot, that rode with the damosel in a fair highway. What, said Sir Launcelot, is he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) a thief and a knight and a ravisher of women?
<p/>But, fair damosel, ye shall ride on afore, yourself, and I will keep myself in covert, and if that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) trouble you or distress you
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) doth shame unto the order of knighthood, and contrary unto his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) oath; it is pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) liveth. I shall be your rescue and learn him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to be ruled as a knight.
<p/>So the maid rode on by the way a soft ambling pace, and within a while came out that knight on horseback out of the wood, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) page with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) put the damosel from her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) horse, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) cried.
<p/>With that came Launcelot as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might till he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came to that knight, saying, O thou false knight and traitor unto knighthood, who did learn thee to distress ladies and gentlewomen?
<p/>When the knight saw Sir Launcelot thus rebuking him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) answered not, but drew his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword and rode unto Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot threw his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear from him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword, and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) such a buffet on the helmet that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) clave his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head and neck unto the throat.
<p/>Now hast thou thy payment that long thou hast deserved! That is truth, said the damosel, for like as Sir Turquine watched to destroy knights,
<p/>so did this knight attend to destroy and distress ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name was Sir Peris de Forest Savage.
<p/>Nay, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>Turquine</b></font>) said, at this time, but almighty Jesu preserve you wheresomever ye ride or go, for the curteist knight thou art, and meekest unto all ladies and gentlewomen, that now liveth.
<p/>Now, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, will ye any more service of me? But one thing, sir knight, methinketh ye lack, ye that are a knight wifeless
<p/>, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will not love some maiden or gentlewoman, for I could never hear say that ever ye loved any of no manner degree, and that is great pity; but it is noised that ye love Queen Guenever, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) hath ordained by enchantment that ye shall never love none other but her (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>), nor none other damosel nor lady shall rejoice you; wherefore many in this land, of high estate and low, make great sorrow.
<p/>Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I may not warn people to speak of me what it pleaseth them; but for to be a wedded man, I think it not; for then I must couch with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and leave arms and tournaments, battles, and adventures; and as for to say for to take my pleasaunce with paramours, that will I refuse in principal for dread of God; for knights that be adventurous or lecherous shall not be happy nor fortunate unto the wars, for other they shall be overcome with a simpler knight than they be themselves, other else they shall by unhap and their cursedness slay better men than they be themselves.
<p/>And so who that useth paramours shall be unhappy, and all thing is unhappy that is about them. And so Sir Launcelot and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) departed.
<p/>So on the third day he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode over a long bridge, and there stert upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) suddenly a passing foul churl, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) smote his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse on the nose that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) turned about, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode over that bridge without his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) licence.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode in a deep forest two days and more, and had strait lodging. Why should I not ride this way? said Sir Launcelot, I may not ride beside.
<p/>Thou shalt not choose, said the churl, and lashed at him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) with a great club shod with iron. Then Sir Launcelot drew his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword and put the stroke aback, and clave his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head unto the paps.
<p/>At the end of the bridge was a fair village, and all the people, men and women, cried on Sir Launcelot, and said, A worse deed didst thou never for thyself, for thou hast slain the chief porter of our castle.
<p/>Sir Launcelot let them say what they would, and straight he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) went into the castle; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) came into the castle he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) alighted, and tied his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) horse to a ring on the wall and there he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) saw a fair green court, and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), for there him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) thought was a fair place to fight in.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) looked about, and saw much people in doors and windows that said, Fair knight, thou art unhappy. CHAPTER XI.
<p/>ANON withal came there upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) two great giants, well armed all save the heads, with two horrible clubs in their hands.
<p/>Sir Launcelot put his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and put the stroke away of the one giant, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) clave his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head asunder.
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fellow saw that, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ran away as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) were wood, for fear of the horrible strokes, and Launcelot after him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on the shoulder, and clave him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to the navel.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there came afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) three score ladies and damosels, and all kneeled unto him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and thanked God and him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) of their deliverance; For sir, said they, the most party of us have been here this seven year their prisoners, and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all great gentlewomen born; and blessed be the time, knight, that ever thou be born, for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in this world, that will we bear record, and we all pray you to tell us your name, that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison.
<p/>How Sir Launcelot slew two giants, and made a castle free. Fair damosel, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake.
<p/>Ah, sir, said they all, well mayest thou be he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), for else save yourself, as we deemed, there might never knight have the better of these two giants; for many fair knights have assayed it, and here have ended, and many times have we wished after you, and these two giants dread never knight but you.
<p/>Now may ye say, said Sir Launcelot, unto your friends how and who hath delivered you, and greet them all from me, and if that I come in any of your marches, show me such cheer as ye have cause, and what treasure that there in this castle is I give it you for a reward for your grievance, and the lord that is owner of this castle I would he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) received it as is right.
<p/>Fair sir, said they, the name of this castle is Tintagil, and a duke ought it sometime that had wedded fair Igraine, and after wedded her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) Uther Pendragon, and gat on her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) Arthur.
<p/>Well, said Sir Launcelot, I understand to whom this castle longeth; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) departed from them, and betaught them unto God.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mounted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) horse, and rode into many strange and wild countries, and through many waters and valleys, and evil was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lodged.
<p/>And at the last by fortune him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) happened, against a night, to come to a fair courtelage, and therein he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) found an old gentlewoman that lodged him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with good will, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had good cheer for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) horse.
<p/>And when time was, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) host brought him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) into a fair garret, over the gate, to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bed. There Sir Launcelot unarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and set his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) harness by him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and went to bed, and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fell asleep.
<p/>So, soon after, there came one on horseback, and knocked at the gate in great haste, and when Sir Launcelot heard this, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arose up and looked out at the window, and saw by the moonlight three knights came riding after that one man, and all three lashed on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once with swords, and that one knight turned on them knightly again, and defended him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>shall I help, for it were shame for me to see three knights on one, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be slain I am partner of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) death; and therewith
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) harness, and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high, Turn you knights unto me, and leave your fighting with that knight.
<p/>And then they all three left Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot, and there began great battle, for they alighted all three, and struck many great strokes at Sir Launcelot, and assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) on every side.
<p/>Truly, said Sir Launcelot, yonder one knight Then Sir Kay dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) for to have holpen Sir Launcelot. Nay, sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>),
<p/>I will none of your help; therefore as ye will have my help, let me alone with them. Sir Kay, for the pleasure of the knight, suffered him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) for to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) will, and so stood aside.
<p/>And then anon within six strokes, Sir Launcelot had stricken them to the earth. And then they all three cried: Sir knight, we yield us unto you as a man of might makeless.
<p/>But so that ye will yield you unto Sir Kay the Seneschal, on that covenant I will save your lives, and else not.
<p/>Fair knight, said they, that were we loath to do; for as for Sir Kay, we chased him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) hither, and had overcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) had not ye been, therefore to yield us unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>)
<p/>Well, as to that, said Launcelot, advise you well, for ye may choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be yolden it shall be unto Sir Kay.
<p/>As to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take your yielding unto me. it were no reason. Fair knight, then they said, in saving of our lives we will do as thou commandest us.
<p/>Then shall ye, said Sir Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming, go unto the court of King Arthur, and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever, and put you all three in her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay sent you thither to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) prisoners.
<p/>Sir, they said, it shall be done by the faith of our bodies, an we be living, and there they swore every knight upon his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot knocked at the gate with the pommel of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword, and with that came his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) host, and in they entered Sir Kay and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>).
<p/>And so Sir Launcelot suffered them so to depart. Sir, said his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) host, I weened ye had been in your bed.
<p/>So I was, said Sir Launcelot, but I rose and leapt out at my window for to help an old fellow of mine.
<p/>And so when they came nigh the light, Sir Kay knew well that it was Sir Launcelot, and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) kneeled down and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) kindness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) had holpen him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) twice from the death.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) said, I have nothing done but that me ought for to do, and ye are welcome, and here shall ye repose you and take your rest.
<p/>So when Sir Kay was unarmed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) asked after meat; so there was meat fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) ate strongly. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) had supped they went to their beds and were lodged together in one bed.
<p/>On the morn Sir Launcelot arose early, and left Sir Kay sleeping, and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay's armour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) shield, and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) went to the stable, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) host, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) departed.
<p/>Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) espied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) armour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse.
<p/>I know well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) will grieve some of the court of King Arthur; for on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights will be bold, and deem that it is I, and that will beguile them.
<p/>Now by my faith And because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) armour and shield I am sure I shall ride in peace. And then soon after departed Sir Kay and thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) host.
<p/>NOW turn we unto Sir Launcelot that had ridden long in a great forest, and at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) came into a low country, full of fair rivers and meadows.
<p/>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot rode disguised in Sir Kay's harness, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) smote down a knight. And afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) saw a long bridge, and three pavilions stood thereon, of silk and sendal of divers hue.
<p/>And without the pavilions hung three white shields on truncheons of spears, and great long spears stood upright by the pavilions, and at every pavilion's door stood three fresh squires, and so Sir Launcelot passed by them and spake no word.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) was passed the three knights said them that it was the proud Kay ; He (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) weeneth no knight so good as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and the contrary is ofttime proved.
<p/>By my faith, said one of the knights, his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) name was Sir Gaunter, I will ride after him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) and assay him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) pride, and ye may behold how that I speed.
<p/>So this knight, Sir Gaunter, armed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and hung his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield upon his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shoulder, and mounted upon a great horse, and gat his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand, and walloped after Sir Launcelot.
<p/>So Sir Launcelot turned him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and either feutred their spears, and came together with all their mights, and Sir Gaunter's spear brake, but Sir Launcelot smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) down horse and man.
<p/>And when Sir Gaunter was at the earth his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brethren said each one to other, Yonder knight is not Sir Kay, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) is bigger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>).
<p/>I dare lay my head, said Sir Gilmere, yonder knight hath slain Sir Kay and hath taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) harness.
<p/>Whether it be so or no, said Sir Raynold, the third brother, let us now go mount upon our horses and rescue our brother Sir Gaunter, upon pain of death.
<p/>We all shall have work enough to match that knight, for ever meseemeth by his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) person it is Sir Launcelot, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Pelleas, the good knight.
<p/>Then anon they took their horses and overtook Sir Launcelot, and Sir Gilmere put forth his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear, and ran to Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) down that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lay in a swoon.
<p/>Sir knight, said Sir Raynold, thou art a strong man, and as I suppose thou hast slain my two brethren, for the which raseth my heart sore against thee, and if I might with my worship
<p/>I would not have ado with you, but needs I must take part as they do, and therefore, knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, keep thyself.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) cried, Abide, thou proud knight Sir Kay, for thou shalt not pass quit. And so they hurtled together with all their mights, and all to-shivered both their spears.
<p/>Anon therewith arose Sir Gaunter, and came unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) brother Sir Gilmere, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), Arise, and help we our brother Sir Raynold, that yonder marvellously matched yonder good knight.
<p/>And then they drew their swords and lashed together eagerly. Therewithal, they leapt on their horses and hurtled unto Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw them come he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) smote a sore stroke unto Sir Raynold, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse to the ground, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) struck to the other two brethren, and at two strokes he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) struck them down to the earth.
<p/>Now let be, said Sir Launcelot, I was not far from thee when thou wert made knight, Sir Raynold, and also I know thou art
<p/>With that Sir Raynold began to start up with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head all bloody, and came straight unto Sir Launcelot. a good knight, and
<p/>Gramercy, said Sir Raynold, as for your goodness; and I dare say as for me and my brethren, we will not be loath to yield us unto you, with that we knew your name,
<p/>loath I were to slay thee. for well we know ye are not Sir Kay. As for that be it as it be
<p/>may, for ye shall yield you unto dame Guenever, and look that ye be with her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) on Whitsunday, and yield you unto her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) as prisoners, and say that Sir Kay sent you unto her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>).
<p/>Then they swore it should be done, and so passed forth Sir Launcelot, and each one of the brethren holp other
<p/>as well as they might. CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Launcelot jousted against four knights of the Round Table and overthrew them.
<p/>SO Sir Launcelot rode into a deep forest, and thereby in a slade, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) saw four knights hoving under an oak, and they were of Arthur's court, one was Sir Sagramour le Desirous, and Ector de Maris, and Sir Gawaine, and Sir Uwaine.
<p/>Now by my faith, said Sir Sagramour, I will prove Sir Kay's might, and gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) hand, and came toward Sir Launcelot.
<p/>Therewith Sir Launcelot was ware and knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) well, and feutred his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) spear against him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and smote Sir Sagramour so sore that horse and man fell both to the earth.
<p/>Lo, my fellows, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), yonder ye may see what a buffet he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) hath; that knight is much bigger than ever was Sir Kay.
<p/>Anon as these four knights had espied Sir Launcelot, they weened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) arms it had been Sir Kay. Now shall ye see what I may do to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>).
<p/>So Sir Ector gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) hand and walloped toward Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) through the shield and shoulder, that man and horse went to the earth, and ever his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spear held.
<p/>By my faith, said Sir Uwaine, yonder is a strong knight, and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath slain Sir Kay; and I see by his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) great strength it will be hard to match him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>).
<p/>And therewithal, Sir Uwaine gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) hand and rode toward Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) well, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) on the plain, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) such a buffet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was astonied, that long he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) wist not where he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) shield and gat a good spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) hand, and Sir Launcelot knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) well; and then they let run their horses with all their mights, and either knight smote other in midst of the shield.
<p/>Now see I well, said Sir Gawaine, I must encounter with that knight. But Sir Gawaine's spear to-brast, and Sir Launcelot charged so sore upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse reversed up-so-down.
<p/>And much sorrow had Sir Gawaine to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse, and so Sir Launcelot passed on a pace and smiled, and said, God give him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) joy that this spear made, for there came never a better in my hand.
<p/>Then the four knights went each one to other and comforted each other. What say ye by this guest? said Sir Gawaine, that one spear hath felled us all four.
<p/>Ye may well say it, said Sir Gawaine, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) is a man of might, for I dare lay my head
<p/>We commend him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) unto the devil, they said all, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) is a man of great might. it is Sir Launcelot, I know it by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) riding.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) go, said Sir Gawaine, for when we come to the court then shall we wit; and then had they much sorrow to get their horses again.
<p/>How Sir Launcelot followed a brachet into a castle, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) found a dead knight, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) after was required of a damosel to heal her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother.
<p/>NOW leave we there and speak of Sir Launcelot that rode a great while in a deep forest, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) saw a black brachet, seeking in manner as it had been in the feute of an hurt deer.
<p/>CHAPTER XIV. And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) rode after the brachet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) saw lie on the ground a large feute of blood.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot rode after. And ever the brachet looked behind her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and so she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went through a great marsh, and ever Sir Launcelot followed.
<p/>So Sir Launcelot rode over that bridge that was old and feeble; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) came in midst of a great hall, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) saw lie a dead knight that was a seemly man, and that brachet licked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wounds.
<p/>And therewithal came out a lady weeping and wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, O knight, too much sorrow hast thou brought me.
<p/>And then was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ware of an old manor, and thither ran the brachet, and so over the bridge. Why say ye
<p/>this brachet brought me; and therefore, fair lady, be not displeased with me, for I am full sore aggrieved of your grievance.
<p/>so? said Sir Launcelot, I did never this knight no harm, for hither by feute of blood Truly, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, I trow it be not ye that hath slain my husband,
<p/>for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that did that deed is sore wounded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is never likely to recover, that shall I ensure him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) name was called Sir Gilbert the Bastard, one of the best knights of the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that hath slain him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
<p/>What was your husband's name? said Sir Launcelot. I know not his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) name. Now God send you better comfort, said Sir Launcelot; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) departed and went into the forest again, and
<p/>there he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) met with a damosel, the which knew him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said aloud, Well be ye found, my lord; and now I require thee, on thy knighthood, help my brother that is sore wounded, and never stinteth bleeding; for this day he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fought with Sir Gilbert the Bastard and slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Bastard</b></font>) in plain battle, and there was my brother sore wounded, and there is a lady a sorceress that dwelleth in a castle here beside, and
<p/>this day she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me my brother's wounds should never be whole till I could find a knight that would go into the Chapel Perilous, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should find a sword and a bloody cloth that the wounded knight was lapped in, and a piece of that cloth and sword should heal my brother's wounds, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wounds were searched with the sword and the cloth.
<p/>This is a marvellous thing, said Sir Launcelot, but what is your brother's name? Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) name was Sir Meliot de Logres.
<p/>That me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is a fellow of the Table Round, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) help I will do my power.
<p/>Then, sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), follow even this highway, and it will bring you unto the Chapel Perilous; and here I shall abide till God send you here again, and, but you speed, I know no knight living that may achieve that adventure.
<p/>How Sir Launcelot came into the Chapel Perilous and gat there of a dead corpse a piece of the cloth and a sword.
<p/>so Sir Launcelot departed, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came unto the Chapel Perilous he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) alighted down, and tied his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse unto a little gate.
<p/>And as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was within the churchyard he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw on the front of the chapel many fair rich shields turned up-so-down, and many of the shields Sir Launcelot had seen knights bear beforehand.
<p/>there stand a thirty great knights, more by a yard than any man that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen, and all those grinned and gnashed at Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw their countenance he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreaded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sore, and so put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shield afore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sword ready in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand ready unto battle, and they were all armed in black harness ready with their shields and their swords drawn.
<p/>And when Sir Launcelot would have gone throughout them, they scattered on every side of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the way, and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waxed all bold, and entered into the chapel, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw no light but a dim lamp burning, and
<p/>CHAPTER XV. RIGHT With that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ware of a corpse hilled with a cloth of silk.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot stooped down, and cut a piece away of that cloth, and then it fared under him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as the earth had quaked a little;
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw a fair sword lie by the dead knight, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) gat in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand and hied him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) out of the chapel.
<p/>all the knights spake to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) with a grimly voice, and said, Knight, Sir Launcelot, lay that sword from thee or else thou shalt die.
<p/>Whether that I live or die, said Sir Launcelot, with no great word get ye it again, therefore fight for it an ye list.
<p/>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) passed throughout them, and beyond the chapel yard there met him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) a fair damosel, and said, Sir Launcelot, leave that sword behind thee, or thou wilt die for it.
<p/>therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) feared. Anon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was in the chapel yard Then right I leave it not, said Sir Launcelot, for no treaties.
<p/>No, said she (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>), an thou didst leave that sword, Queen Guenever should thou never see. Then were I a fool an
<p/>I would leave this sword, said Launcelot. Now, gentle knight, said the damosel, I require thee to kiss me but once.
<p/>Well, sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), an thou hadst kissed me thy life days had been done, but now, alas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said, I have lost all my labour, for I ordained this chapel for thy sake, and for Sir Gawaine.
<p/>And once I had Sir Gawaine within me, and at that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fought with that knight that lieth there dead in yonder chapel, Sir Gilbert the Bastard; and at that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bastard</b></font>) smote the left hand off of Sir Gilbert the Bastard.
<p/>And, Sir Launcelot, now I tell thee, I have loved thee this seven year, but there may no woman have thy love but Queen Guenever.
<p/>But sithen I may not rejoice thee to have thy body alive, I had kept no more joy in this world but to have thy body dead.
<p/>Then would I have balmed it and served it, and so have kept it my life days, and daily I should have clipped thee, and kissed thee, in despite of Queen Guenever.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Launcelot, that God me forbid. Ye say well, said Sir Launcelot, Jesu preserve me from your subtle crafts.
<p/>And as the book saith, when Sir Launcelot was departed she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) took such sorrow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) died within a fourteen night, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) name was Hellawes the sorceress, Lady of the Castle Nigramous.
<p/>And therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) horse and so departed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>). Anon Sir Launcelot met with the damosel, Sir Meliot's sister.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hands, and wept for joy. And then they rode unto a castle thereby where lay Sir Meliot.
<p/>When Sir Meliot saw Sir Launcelot he (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) kneeled upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) knees and cried on high: O lord Sir Launcelot, help me!
<p/>And anon as Sir Launcelot saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) was passing pale, as the earth, for bleeding. Anon Sir Launcelot leapt unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) wounds with Sir Gilbert's sword.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) wounds with a part of the bloody cloth that Sir Gilbert was wrapped in, and anon an wholer man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) life
<p/>And then there was great joy between them, and they made Sir Launcelot all the cheer that they might, and so on the morn Sir Launcelot took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) leave, and bade Sir Meliot hie him (<font color='blue'><b>Meliot</b></font>) to the court of my lord Arthur, for it draweth nigh to the Feast of Pentecost, and there by the grace of God ye shall find me.
<p/>was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) never. And therewith they departed. CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Launcelot at the request of a lady recovered a falcon, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was deceived.
<p/>AND so Sir Launcelot rode through many strange countries, over marshes and valleys, till by fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came to a fair castle, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) passed beyond the castle him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heard two bells ring.
<p/>came flying over his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head toward an high elm, and long lunes about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feet, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) flew unto the elm to take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) perch the lunes over-cast about a bough.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) flight she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hung by the legs fast; and Sir Launcelot saw how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hung, and beheld the fair falcon perigot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>The meanwhile came a lady out of the castle and cried on high: O Launcelot, Launcelot, as thou art flower of all knights, help me to get my hawk, for an my hawk be lost my lord will destroy me; for I kept the hawk and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slipped from me, and if my lord my husband wit it
<p/>And then was he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) ware of a falcon he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is so hasty that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) will slay me. What is your lord's name? said Sir Launcelot.
<p/>since that ye know my name, and require me of knighthood to help you, I will do what I may to get your hawk, and yet God knoweth I am an ill climber, and the tree is passing high, and few boughs to help me withal.
<p/>Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) name is Sir Phelot, a knight that longeth unto the King of Northgalis. Well, fair lady, And therewith Sir Launcelot alighted, and tied his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horse to the same tree, and prayed the lady to unarm him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>And so when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was unarmed, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) put off all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) clothes unto his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) shirt and breech, and with might and force he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) clomb up to the falcon, and tied the lines to a great rotten boyshe, and threw the hawk down and it withal.
<p/>that was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, all armed and with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) naked sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand, and said: O knight Launcelot, now have I found thee as I would, and stood at the bole of the tree to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Anon the lady gat the hawk in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand; and therewithal came out Sir Phelot out of the groves suddenly, Ah, lady, said Sir Launcelot, why have ye betrayed me?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hath done, said Sir Phelot, but as I commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and therefore there nis none other boot but thine hour is come that thou must die.
<p/>That were shame unto thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou an armed knight to slay a naked man by treason. Thou gettest none other grace, said Sir Phelot, and therefore help thyself an thou canst.
<p/>Truly, said Sir Launcelot, that shall be thy shame, but since thou wilt do none other, take mine harness with thee, and hang my sword upon a bough that I may get it, and then do thy best to slay me an thou canst.
<p/>Nay, nay, said Sir Phelot, for I know thee better than thou weenest , therefore thou gettest no weapon, an I may keep you therefrom.
<p/>And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) waited above him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and under him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and over his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) saw a rownsepyk, a big bough leafless, and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brake it off by the body.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came lower and awaited how his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own horse stood, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) leapt on the further side of the horse, fro-ward the knight.
<p/>Alas, said Sir Launcelot, that ever a knight should die weaponless. And then Sir Phelot lashed at him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) eagerly, weening to have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>But Sir Launcelot put away the stroke with the rownsepyk, and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on the one side of the head, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell down in a swoon to the ground.
<p/>So then Sir Launcelot took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword out of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand, and struck his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) neck from the body. Then cried the lady, Alas!
<p/>I am not causer, said Sir Launcelot, for with falsehood ye would have had slain me with treason, and now it is fallen on you both.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Launcelot gat all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) armour as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) might, and put it upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) for dread of more resort, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) dreaded that the knight's castle was so nigh.
<p/>And so, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) might, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) horse and departed, and thanked God that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) had escaped that adventure.
<p/>why hast thou slain my husband? And then she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) swooned as though she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would die. CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot overtook a knight which chased his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wife to have slain her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and how he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode in a valley he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw a knight chasing a lady, with a naked sword, to have slain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>And by fortune as this knight should have slain this lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried on Sir Launcelot and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>When Sir Launcelot saw that mischief, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and rode between them, saying, Knight, fie for shame, why wilt thou slay this lady?
<p/>SO Sir Launcelot rode many wild ways, throughout marches and many wild ways. thou dost shame unto thee and all knights.
<p/>What hast thou to do betwixt me and my wife? said the knight. I will slay her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) maugre thy head. That shall ye not, said Sir Launcelot, for rather we two will have ado together.
<p/>Sir Launcelot, said the knight, thou dost not thy part, for this lady hath betrayed me. It is not so, said the lady, truly he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saith wrong on me.
<p/>And for because I love and cherish my cousin germain, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is jealous betwixt him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) and me; and as I shall answer to God there was never sin
<p/>But, sir, said the lady, as thou art called the worshipfullest knight of the world, I require thee of true knighthood, keep me and save me.
<p/>betwixt us. For whatsomever ye say he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will slay me, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is without mercy. Have ye no doubt, said Launcelot, it shall not lie in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) power.
<p/>And so Sir Launcelot rode on the one side and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on the other: he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had not ridden but a while, but the knight bade Sir Launcelot turn him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and look behind him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and said, Sir, yonder come men of arms after us riding.
<p/>And so Sir Launcelot turned him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and thought no treason, and therewith was the knight and the lady on one side, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) swapped off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady's head.
<p/>And when Sir Launcelot had espied him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had done, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), Traitor, thou hast shamed me for ever.
<p/>And suddenly Sir Launcelot alighted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) horse, and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) sword to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>), and therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) fell flat to the earth, and gripped Sir Launcelot by the thighs, and cried mercy.
<p/>Fie on thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou shameful knight, thou mayest have no mercy, and therefore arise and fight with me.
<p/>Sir, said the knight, in your sight I will be ruled as ye will have me. Nay, said the knight, I will never arise till ye grant me mercy.
<p/>Now will I proffer thee fair, said Launcelot, I will unarm me unto my shirt, and I will have nothing upon me but my shirt, and my sword and my hand.
<p/>Well, said Sir Launcelot, take this lady and the head, and bear it upon thee, and here shalt thou swear upon my sword, to bear it always upon thy back, and never to rest till thou come to Queen Guenever.
<p/>And if thou canst slay me, quit be thou for ever. Nay, sir, said Pedivere, that will I never. Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>), that will I do, by the faith of my body.
<p/>Now, said Launcelot, tell me what is your name? Sir, my name is Pedivere. In a shameful hour wert thou born, said Launcelot.
<p/>So Pedivere departed with the dead lady and the head, and found the queen with King Arthur at Winchester, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) told all the truth.
<p/>Sir knight, said the queen, this is an horrible deed and a shameful, and a great rebuke unto Sir Launcelot; but notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) worship is not known in many divers countries; but this shall I give you in penance, make ye as good shift as ye can, ye shall bear this lady with you on horseback unto the Pope of Rome, and of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) receive your penance for your foul deeds; and ye shall never rest one night whereas ye do another; an ye go to any bed the dead body shall lie with you.
<p/>And as it telleth in the French book, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) came to Rome, the Pope bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) go again unto Queen Guenever, and in Rome was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) lady buried by the Pope's commandment.
<p/>This oath there he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) made, and so departed. And after this Sir Pedivere fell to great goodness, and was an holy man and an hermit.
<p/>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot came to King Arthur's Court, and how there were recounted all his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) noble feats and acts.
<p/>NOW turn we unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, that came home two days afore the Feast of Pentecost; and the king and all the court were passing fain of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) coming.
<p/>And when Sir Gawaine, Sir Uwaine, Sir Sagramore, Sir Ector de Maris, saw Sir Launcelot in Kay's armour, then they wist well it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) that smote them down all with one spear.
<p/>And ever now and now came all the knights home that Sir Turquine had prisoners, and they all honoured and worshipped Sir Launcelot.
<p/>When Sir Gaheris heard them speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) said, I saw all the battle from the beginning to the ending, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) told King Arthur all how it was, and how Sir Turquine was the strongest knight that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw except Sir Launcelot: there were many knights bare him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) record, nigh three score.
<p/>Then Sir Kay told the king how Sir Launcelot had rescued him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) should have been slain, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) made the knights yield them to me, and not to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>).
<p/>Then there was laughing and smiling among them. And there they were all three, and bare record. And by Jesu, said Sir Kay, because Sir Launcelot took my harness and left me his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>)
<p/>I rode in good peace, and no man would have ado with me. Anon therewithal there came the three knights that fought with Sir Launcelot at the long bridge.
<p/>And there they yielded them unto Sir Kay, and Sir Kay forsook them and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) fought never with them. But I shall ease your heart, said Sir Kay, yonder is Sir Launcelot that overcame you.
<p/>And then Sir Meliot de Logres came home, and told the king how Sir Launcelot had saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Logres</b></font>) from the death.
<p/>And all his (<font color='blue'><b>Logres</b></font>) deeds were known, how four queens, sorceresses, had him (<font color='blue'><b>Logres</b></font>) in prison, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Logres</b></font>) was delivered by King Bagdemagus' daughter.
<p/>Also there were told all the great deeds of arms that Sir Launcelot did betwixt the two kings, that is for to say the King of Northgalis and King Bagdemagus.
<p/>All the truth Sir Gahalantine did tell, and Sir Mador de la Porte and Sir Mordred, for they were at that same tournament.
<p/>When they wist that they were glad. Then came in the lady that knew Sir Launcelot when that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wounded Sir Belleus at the pavilion.
<p/>And so at that time Sir Launcelot had the greatest name of any knight of the world, and most he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was honoured of high and low.
<p/>And there, at request of Sir Launcelot, Sir Belleus was made knight of the Round Table. Explicit the noble tale of Sir Launcelot du Lake, which is the vi.
<p/>Here followeth the tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that was called Beaumains by Sir Kay, and is the seventh book.
<p/>WHEN Arthur held his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) Round Table most plenour, it fortuned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) commanded that the high feast of Pentecost should be holden at a city and a castle, the which in those days was called Kynke Kenadonne, upon the sands that marched nigh Wales.
<p/>So ever the king had a custom that at the feast of Pentecost in especial, afore other feasts in the year, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would not go that day to meat until he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had heard or seen of a great marvel.
<p/>book. BOOK VII. CHAPTER I. How Beaumains came to King Arthur's Court and demanded three petitions of King Arthur. And for that custom all manner of strange adventures came before Arthur as at that feast before all other feasts.
<p/>And so Sir Gawaine, a little to-fore noon of the day of Pentecost, espied at a window three men upon horseback, and a dwarf on foot, and so the three men alighted, and the dwarf kept their horses, and one of the three men was higher than the other twain by a foot and an half.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine went unto the king and said, Sir, go to your meat, for here at the hand come strange adventures.
<p/>And there were all the knights of the Round Table, -LSB-save-RSB- only those that were prisoners or slain at a recounter.
<p/>Then at the high feast evermore they should be fulfilled the whole number of an hundred and fifty, for then was the Round Table fully complished.
<p/>Right so came into the hall two men well beseen and richly, and upon their shoulders there leaned the goodliest young man and the fairest that ever they all saw, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was large and long, and broad in the shoulders, and well visaged, and the fairest and the largest handed that ever man saw, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fared as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might not go nor bear himself
<p/>Anon as Arthur saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) there was made peace and room, and right so they yede with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) unto the high dais, without saying of any words.
<p/>Then this much young man pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aback, and easily stretched up straight, saying, King Arthur, God you bless and all your fair fellowship, and in especial the fellowship of the Table Round.
<p/>And for this cause I am come hither, to pray you and require you to give me three gifts, and they shall not be unreasonably asked, but that ye may worshipfully and honourably grant them me, and to you
<p/>So Arthur went unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) meat with many other kings. but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) leaned upon their shoulders. no great hurt nor loss.
<p/>And the first don and gift I will ask now, and the other two gifts I will ask this day twelvemonth, wheresomever ye hold your high feast.
<p/>Now, sir, this is my petition for this feast, that ye will give me meat and drink sufficiently for this twelvemonth, and at that day I will ask mine other two gifts.
<p/>My fair son, said Arthur, ask better, I counsel thee, for this is but a simple asking; for my heart giveth me to thee greatly, that thou art come of men of worship, and greatly my conceit faileth me but thou shalt prove a man of right great worship.
<p/>Now ask, said Arthur, and ye shall have your asking. Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, thereof be as it be may, I have asked that I will ask.
<p/>Well, said the king, ye shall have meat and drink enough; I never defended that none, neither my friend nor my foe.
<p/>But what is thy name I would wit? I cannot tell you, said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). That is marvel, said the king, that thou knowest not thy name, and thou art
<p/>Then the king betook him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to Sir Kay the steward, and charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) should give him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) of all manner of meats and drinks of the best, and also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) had all manner of finding as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) were a lord's son.
<p/>That shall little need, said Sir Kay, to do such cost upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>); for I dare undertake he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) is a villain born, and never will make man, for an he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come of gentlemen he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have asked of you horse and armour, but such as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asketh.
<p/>And sithen he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hath no name, I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a name that shall be Beaumains, that is Fair-hands, and into the kitchen I shall bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall have fat brose every day, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall be as fat by the twelvemonths' end as a pork hog.
<p/>the goodliest young man that ever I saw. Right so the two men departed and beleft him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Sir Kay, that scorned him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) and mocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>).
<p/>How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine were wroth because Sir Kay mocked Beaumains, and of a damosel which desired a knight to fight for a lady.
<p/>CHAPTER II. THEREAT was Sir Gawaine wroth, and in especial Sir Launcelot bade Sir Kay leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) mocking, for I dare lay my head he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) shall prove a man of great worship.
<p/>Beware, said Sir Launcelot, so ye gave the good knight Brewnor, Sir Dinadan's brother, a name, and ye called him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) La Cote Male Taile, and that turned you to anger afterward.
<p/>Let be said Sir Kay, it may not be by no reason, for as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) is, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) hath asked. As for that, said Sir Kay, this shall never prove none such.
<p/>For Sir Brewnor desired ever worship, and this desireth bread and drink and broth; upon pain of my life he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was fostered up in some abbey, and, howsomever it was, they failed meat and drink, and so hither he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) is come for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) sustenance.
<p/>And so Sir Kay bade get him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) a place, and sit down to meat; so Beaumains went to the hall door, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) down among boys and lads, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) ate sadly.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot after meat bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) chamber, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) should have meat and drink enough.
<p/>And so did Sir Gawaine: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) refused them all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) would do none other but as Sir Kay commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), for no proffer.
<p/>But as touching Sir Gawaine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) had reason to proffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) lodging, meat, and drink, for that proffer came of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) blood, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was nearer kin to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) wist.
<p/>But that as Sir Launcelot did was of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) great gentleness and courtesy. So thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was put into the kitchen, and lay nightly as the boys of the kitchen did.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) endured all that twelvemonth, and never displeased man nor child, but always he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was meek and mild. But ever when that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw any jousting of knights, that would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) see an he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might.
<p/>And ever Sir Launcelot would give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gold to spend, and clothes, and so did Sir Gawaine, and where there were any masteries done, thereat would he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) be,
<p/>and there might none cast bar nor stone to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) by two yards. Then would Sir Kay say, How liketh you my boy of the kitchen?
<p/>And at that time the king held it at Carlion in the most royallest wise that might be, like as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) did yearly.
<p/>So it passed on till the feast of Whitsuntide. But the king would no meat eat upon the Whitsunday, until he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heard some adventures.
<p/>Then came there a squire to the king and said, Sir, ye may go to your meat, for here cometh a damosel with some strange adventures.
<p/>Then was the king glad and sat him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) down. Right so there came a damosel into the hall and saluted the king, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of succour.
<p/>Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said, I have a lady of great worship and renown, and she (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is besieged with a tyrant, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) may not out of her (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) castle; and because here are called the noblest knights of the world, I come to you to pray you of succour.
<p/>What hight your lady, and where dwelleth she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and who is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and what is his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) name that hath besieged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?
<p/>Sir king, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, as for my lady's name that shall not ye know for me as at this time, but I let you wit she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a lady of great worship and of great lands; and as for the tyrant that besiegeth her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and destroyeth her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lands, he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) is called the Red Knight of the Red Launds.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) well, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) is one of the perilloust knights of the world; men say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) hath seven men's strength, and from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) I escaped once full hard with my life.
<p/>Fair damosel, said the king, there be knights here would do their power for to rescue your lady, but because you will not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name, nor where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dwelleth, therefore none of my knights that here be now shall go with you by my will.
<p/>For whom? said the king, what is the adventure? I know him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) not, said the king. Then must I speak further, said the damosel.
<p/>How Beaumains desired the battle, and how it was granted to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and how he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) desired to be made knight of Sir Launcelot.
<p/>WITH these words came before the king Beaumains, while the damosel was there, and thus he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said, Sir king, God thank you, I have been this twelvemonth in your kitchen, and have had my full sustenance, and now I will ask my two gifts that be behind.
<p/>Sir, this shall be my two gifts, first that ye will grant me to have this adventure of the damosel, for it belongeth unto me.
<p/>Then, sir, this is the other gift, that ye shall bid Launcelot du Lake to make me knight, for of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) I will be made knight and else of none.
<p/>And when I am passed I pray you let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ride after me, and make me knight when I require him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>CHAPTER III. Ask, upon my peril, said the king. Thou shalt have it, said the king, I grant it thee. All this shall be done, said the king.
<p/>Fie on thee, said the damosel, shall I have none but one that is your kitchen page? Then was she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wroth and took her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and departed.
<p/>And with that there came one to Beaumains and told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse and armour was come for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>); and there was
<p/>the dwarf come with all thing that him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) needed, in the richest manner; thereat all the court had much marvel from whence came all that gear.
<p/>right so as he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) came into the hall and took his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) leave of King Arthur, and Sir Gawaine, and Sir Launcelot, and prayed that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would hie after him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and so departed and rode after the damosel.
<p/>How Beaumains departed, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) gat of Sir Kay a spear and a shield, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) jousted with Sir Launcelot.
<p/>BUT there went many after to behold how well he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was horsed and trapped in cloth of gold, but he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had neither shield nor spear.
<p/>Then Sir Kay said all open in the hall, I will ride after my boy in the kitchen, to wit whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) will know me for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) better.
<p/>So when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was armed there was none but few so goodly a man as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was; and CHAPTER IV. Said Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine, Yet abide at home.
<p/>So Sir Kay made him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) ready and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) spear, and rode after him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>). And right as Beaumains overtook the damosel, right so came Sir Kay and said,
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse, and knew it was Sir Kay, that had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) all the despite as ye have heard afore.
<p/>Beaumains, what, sir, know ye not me? Yea, said Beaumains, I know you for an ungentle knight of the court, and therefore beware of me.
<p/>Therewith Sir Kay put his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) spear in the rest, and ran straight upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>); and Beaumains came as fast upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) hand, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) put away his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) spear with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) sword, and with a foin thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) through the side, that Sir Kay fell down as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) had been dead; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) alighted down and took Sir Kay's shield and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) spear, and stert upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) own horse and rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) way.
<p/>All that saw Sir Launcelot, and so did the damosel. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) bade his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) dwarf stert upon Sir Kay's horse, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) did.
<p/>By that Sir Launcelot was come, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) proffered Sir Launcelot to joust; and either made them ready, and they came together so fiercely that either bare down other to the earth, and sore were they bruised.
<p/>And then Beaumains threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) shield from him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and proffered to fight with Sir Launcelot on foot; and so they rushed together like boars, tracing, rasing, and foining to the mountenance of an hour; and Sir Launcelot felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) so big that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) marvelled of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) strength, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) fought more liker a giant than a knight, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) fighting was durable and passing perilous.
<p/>For Sir Launcelot had so much ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) dreaded himself to be shamed, and said, Beaumains, fight not so sore, your quarrel and mine is not so great
<p/>Truly that is truth, said Beaumains, but it doth me good to feel your might, and yet, my lord, I showed not the utterance.
<p/>How Beaumains told to Sir Launcelot his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) name, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was dubbed knight of Sir Launcelot, and after overtook the damosel.
<p/>IN God's name, said Sir Launcelot, for I promise you, by the faith of my body, I had as much to do as I might to save myself from you unshamed, and therefore have ye no doubt of none earthly knight.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot arose and helped him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse. but we may leave off. CHAPTER V. Hope ye so that I may any while stand a proved knight?
<p/>said Beaumains. Yea, said Launcelot, do as ye have done, and I shall be your warrant. Then, I pray you, said Beaumains, give me the order of knighthood.
<p/>Then must ye tell me your name, said Launcelot, and of what kin ye be born. Sir, so that ye will not discover me I shall, said Beaumains.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Launcelot, and that I promise you by the faith of my body, until it be openly known. Then, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, my name is Gareth, and brother unto Sir Gawaine of father and mother.
<p/>for ever me thought ye should be of great blood, and that ye came not to the court neither for meat nor for drink.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) the order of knighthood, and then Sir Gareth prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) for to depart and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) go.
<p/>So Sir Launcelot departed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) and came to Sir Kay, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) to be borne home upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) shield, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was healed hard with the life; and all men scorned Sir Kay, and in especial Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot said it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) part to rebuke no young man, for full little knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) of what birth he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) is come, and for what cause he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) came to this court; and so we leave Sir Kay and turn we unto Beaumains.
<p/>Ah, sir, said Sir Launcelot, I am more gladder of you than I was; When he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) had overtaken the damosel, anon
<p/>, thy clothes be bawdy of the grease and tallow that thou gainest in King Arthur's kitchen; weenest thou, said she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), that I allow thee, for yonder knight
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said, What dost thou here? thou stinkest all of the kitchen that thou killest. Nay truly, for thou slewest him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) unhappily and cowardly; therefore turn again, bawdy kitchen page
<p/>, I know thee well, for Sir Kay named thee Beaumains. What art thou but a lusk and a turner of broaches and a ladle-washer?
<p/>say, for I have undertaken to King Arthur for to achieve your adventure, and so shall I finish it to the end, either I shall die therefore.
<p/>Damosel, said Beaumains, say to me what ye will, I will not go from you whatsomever ye Fie on thee, kitchen knave, wilt thou finish mine adventure?
<p/>thou shalt anon be met withal, that thou wouldest not for all the broth that ever thou suppest once look him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in the face.
<p/>I shall assay, said Beaumains. So thus as they rode in the wood, there came a man flying all that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might.
<p/>O lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, help me, for here by in a slade are six thieves that have taken my lord and bound him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>),
<p/>And so they rode together until they came thereas was the knight bounden; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode unto them, and struck one unto the death, and then another, and at the third stroke he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slew the third thief, and then the other three fled.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode after them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) overtook them; and then those three thieves turned again and assailed Beaumains hard, but at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slew them, and returned and unbound the knight.
<p/>And the knight thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to ride with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) castle there a little beside, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should worshipfully reward him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) good deeds.
<p/>Sir, said Beaumains, I will no reward have: I was this day made knight of noble Sir Launcelot, and therefore I will no reward have, but God reward me.
<p/>Whither wilt thou? said Beaumains. so I am afeard lest they will slay him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Bring me thither, said Beaumains. And also I must follow this damosel.
<p/>For thou smellest all of the kitchen: weenest thou that I have joy of thee, for all this deed that thou hast done is but mishapped thee: but thou shalt see a sight shall make thee turn again, and that lightly.
<p/>Then the same knight which was rescued of the thieves rode after that damosel, and prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to lodge with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) all that night.
<p/>And because it was near night the damosel rode with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) castle, and there they had great cheer, and at supper the knight sat
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ride from her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), Sir Beaumains afore the damosel. Fie, fie, said she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), Sir knight, ye are uncourteous to set a kitchen page
<p/>Then the knight was ashamed at her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) up, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) at a sideboard, and set himself afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and so all that night they had good cheer and merry rest.
<p/>afore me ; him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) beseemeth better to stick a swine than to sit afore a damosel of high parage. CHAPTER VI.
<p/>AND on the morn the damosel and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) took their leave and thanked the knight, and so departed, and rode on their way until they came to a great forest.
<p/>And there was a great river and but one passage, and there were ready two knights on the farther side to let them the passage.
<p/>How Beaumains fought and slew two knights at a passage. What sayest thou, said the damosel, wilt thou match yonder knights or turn again?
<p/>And therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rushed into the water, and in midst of the water either brake their spears upon other to their hands, and then they drew their swords, and smote eagerly at other.
<p/>And at the last Sir Beaumains smote the other upon the helm that his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head stonied, and therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell down in the water, and there was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) drowned.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spurred his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse upon the land, where the other knight fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and brake his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear, and so they drew their swords and fought long together.
<p/>At the last Sir Beaumains clave his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) helm and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head down to the shoulders; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode unto the damosel and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ride forth on her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) way.
<p/>Alas, she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, that ever a kitchen page should have that fortune to destroy such two doughty knights: thou weenest thou hast done doughtily, that is not so; for the first knight his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse stumbled, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was drowned in the water, and never it was by thy force, nor by thy might.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Beaumains, I will not turn again an they were six more. And the last knight by mishap thou camest behind him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and mishappily thou slew him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Damosel, said Beaumains, ye may say what ye will, but with whomsomever I have ado withal, I trust to God to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) or he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) depart.
<p/>And therefore I reck not what ye say, so that I may win your lady. Fie, fie, foul kitchen knave, thou shalt see knights that shall abate thy boast.
<p/>Fair damosel, give me goodly language, and then my care is past, for what knights somever they be, I care not, nor I doubt them not.
<p/>Also, said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I say it for thine avail, yet mayest thou turn again with thy worship; for an thou follow me, thou art but slain, for I see all that ever thou dost is but by misadventure, and not by prowess of thy hands.
<p/>Well, damosel, ye may say what ye will, but wheresomever ye go I will follow you. So this Beaumains rode with that lady till evensong time, and ever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chid him (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>), and would not rest.
<p/>And they came to a black laund; and there was a black hawthorn, and thereon hung a black banner, and on the other side there hung a black shield, and by it stood a black spear great and long, and
<p/>a great black horse covered with silk, and a black stone fast by. CHAPTER VII. How Beaumains fought with the Knight of the Black Launds, and fought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fell down and died.
<p/>Then the damosel, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw that knight, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) flee down that valley, for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse was not saddled.
<p/>THERE sat a knight all armed in black harness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name was the Knight of the Black Laund. Gramercy, said Beaumains, for always ye would have me a coward.
<p/>With that the Black Knight, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), spake and said, Damosel, have ye brought this knight of King Arthur to be your champion?
<p/>Nay, fair knight , said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), this is but a kitchen knave that was fed in King Arthur's kitchen for alms.
<p/>Sir, I cannot be delivered of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), for with me he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) rideth maugre mine head: God would that ye should put him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from me, other to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) an ye may, for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is an unhappy knave, and unhappily he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hath done this day: through mishap
<p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) slay two knights at the passage of the water; and other deeds he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did before right marvellous and through unhappiness.
<p/>Why cometh he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), said the knight, in such array? it is shame that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) beareth you company. That marvelleth me, said the Black Knight, that any man that is of worship will have ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>).
<p/>They know him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) not, said the damosel, and for because he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) rideth with me, they ween that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) be some man of worship born.
<p/>That may be, said the Black Knight; howbeit as ye say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) be no man of worship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is a full likely person, and full like to be a strong man: but thus much shall I grant you, said the Black Knight; I shall put him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) down upon one foot, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) harness he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) shall leave with me, for it were shame to me to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) any more harm.
<p/>When Sir Beaumains heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) say thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) said, Sir knight, thou art full large of my horse and my harness;
<p/>I let thee wit it cost thee nought, and whether it liketh thee or not, this laund will I pass maugre thine head.
<p/>And horse nor harness gettest thou none of mine, but if thou win them with thy hands; and therefore let see what thou canst do.
<p/>Sayest thou that? said the Black Knight, now yield thy lady from thee, for it beseemeth never a kitchen page to ride with such a lady.
<p/>Thou liest, said Beaumains, I am a gentleman born, and of more high lineage than thou, and that will I prove on thy body.
<p/>Then in great wrath they departed with their horses, and came together as it had been the thunder, and the Black Knight's spear brake, and Beaumains thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) through both his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) sides, and therewith his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) spear brake, and the truncheon left still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) side.
<p/>But nevertheless the Black Knight drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) sword, and smote many eager strokes, and of great might, and hurt Beaumains full sore.
<p/>But at the last the Black Knight, within an hour and an half, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fell down off his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) horse in swoon, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) died.
<p/>And when Beaumains saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) so well horsed and armed, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) alighted down and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) armour, and so took his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) horse and rode after the damosel.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) come nigh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) said, Away, kitchen knave, out of the wind, for the smell of thy bawdy clothes grieveth me.
<p/>Alas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) said, that ever such a knave should by mishap slay so good a knight as thou hast done, but all this is thine unhappiness.
<p/>But here by is one shall pay thee all thy payment, and therefore yet I counsel thee, flee. It may happen me, said Beaumains, to be beaten or slain, but I warn you, fair damosel
<p/>, I will not flee away, a nor leave your company, for all that ye can say; for ever ye say that they will kill me or beat me, but howsomever it happeneth I escape, and they lie on the ground.
<p/>And therefore it were as good for you to hold you still thus all day rebuking me, for away will I not till I see the uttermost of this journey, or else I will be slain, other truly beaten; therefore ride on your way, for follow you I will whatsomever happen.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII. How the brother of the knight that was slain met with Beaumains, and fought with Beaumains till he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was yielden.
<p/>as they rode together, they saw a knight come driving by them all in green, both his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) harness; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came nigh the damosel, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), Is that my brother the Black Knight that ye have brought with you?
<p/>Alas, said the Green Knight, that is great pity, that so noble a knight as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was should so unhappily be slain, and namely of a knave's hand, as ye say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is.
<p/>Ah! traitor, said the Green Knight, thou shalt die for slaying of my brother; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was a full noble knight, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name was Sir Perard.
<p/>THUS Nay, nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, this unhappy kitchen knave hath slain your brother through unhappiness. I defy thee, said Beaumains, for I let thee wit
<p/>Therewithal the Green Knight rode unto an horn that was green, and it hung upon a thorn, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) blew three deadly motes, and there came two damosels and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) lightly.
<p/>I slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) knightly and not shamefully. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) took a great horse, and a green shield and a green spear.
<p/>And then they ran together with all their mights, and brake their spears unto their hands. And then they drew their swords, and gave many sad strokes, and either of them wounded other full ill.
<p/>And at the last, at an overthwart, Beaumains with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) horse struck the Green Knight's horse upon the side, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fell to the earth.
<p/>That saw Beaumains, and therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) alighted, and they rushed together like two mighty kemps a long while, and sore they bled both.
<p/>And then the Green Knight avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) horse lightly, and dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) upon foot. With that came the damosel, and said, My lord the Green Knight, why for shame stand
<p/>Alas, it is shame that ever ye were made knight, to see such a lad to match such a knight, as the weed overgrew the corn.
<p/>ye so long fighting with the kitchen knave? Therewith the Green Knight was ashamed, and therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) gave a great stroke of might, and clave his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) shield through.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was a little ashamed of that stroke and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) language; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) such a buffet upon the helm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) knees.
<p/>And then the Green Knight cried him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) mercy, and yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) unto Sir Beaumains, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) not.
<p/>When Beaumains saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) shield cloven asunder And so suddenly Beaumains pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) upon the ground grovelling. All is in vain, said Beaumains, for thou shalt die
<p/>but if this damosel that came with me pray me to save thy life. And therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) helm like as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) would slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>).
<p/>Fie upon thee, false kitchen page, I will never pray thee to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) life, for I will never be so much in thy danger.
<p/>Then shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) die, said Beaumains. Not so hardy, thou bawdy knave, said the damosel, that thou slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>). Alas, said the Green Knight, suffer me not to die for a fair word may save me.
<p/>Fair knight, said the Green Knight, save my life, and I will forgive thee the death of my brother, and for ever to become thy man, and thirty knights that hold of me for ever shall do you service.
<p/>In the devil's name, said the damosel, that such a bawdy kitchen knave should have thee and thirty knights' service. Sir knight, said Beaumains, all this availeth thee not,
<p/>but if my damosel speak with me for thy life. And therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made a semblant to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). Let be, said the damosel, thou bawdy knave; slay him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) not, for an thou do thou shalt repent it.
<p/>Damosel, said Beaumains, your charge is to me a pleasure, and at your commandment his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life shall be saved, and else not.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, Sir knight with the green arms, I release thee quit at this damosel's request, for I will not make her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wroth, I will fulfil all that she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) chargeth me.
<p/>Then said the damosel, Me repenteth, Green Knight, of your damage, and of your brother's death, the Black Knight, for of your help I had great mister, for I dread me sore to pass this forest.
<p/>And then the Green Knight kneeled down, and did him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) homage with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) sword. Nay, dread you not, said the Green Knight, for ye shall lodge with me this night, and to-morn
<p/>I shall help you through this forest. So they took their horses and rode to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) manor, which was fast there beside.
<p/>How the damosel again rebuked Beaumains, and would not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) to sit at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) table, but called him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) kitchen boy.
<p/>AND ever she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rebuked Beaumains, and would not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) to sit at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) table, but as the Green Knight took him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) and sat him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) at a side table.
<p/>Marvel methinketh, said the Green Knight to the damosel, why ye rebuke this noble knight as ye do, for I warn you, damosel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is a full noble knight, and I know no knight is able to match him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); therefore ye do great wrong to rebuke him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall do you right good service, for whatsomever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) maketh himself
<p/>CHAPTER IX. , ye shall prove at the end that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is come of a noble blood and of king's lineage.
<p/>Truly, said the Green Knight, it were shame for me to say of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) any disworship, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) hath proved himself a better knight than I am, yet
<p/>Fie, fie, said the damosel, it is shame for you to say of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) such worship. have I met with many knights in my days, and never or this time have I found
<p/>And so that night they yede unto rest, and all that night the Green Knight commanded thirty knights privily to watch Beaumains, for to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) from all treason.
<p/>And so on the morn they all arose, and heard their mass and brake their fast; and then they took their horses and rode on their way, and the Green Knight conveyed them through the forest; and there the Green Knight said, My lord Beaumains, I and these thirty knights shall be always at your summons, both early and late, at your calling and whither that ever ye will send us.
<p/>It is well said, said Beaumains; when that I call upon you ye must yield you unto King Arthur, and all your knights.
<p/>no knight his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) match. If that ye so command us, we shall be ready at all times, said the Green Knight.
<p/>Fie, fie upon thee, in the devil's name, said the damosel, that any good knights should be obedient unto a kitchen knave.
<p/>So then departed the Green Knight and the damosel. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) said unto Beaumains, Why followest thou me, thou kitchen boy?
<p/>Cast away thy shield and thy spear, and flee away; yet I counsel thee betimes or thou shalt say right soon, alas; for wert thou as wight
<p/>as ever was Wade or Launcelot, Tristram, or the good knight Sir Lamorak , thou shalt not pass a pass here that is called the Pass Perilous.
<p/>Damosel, said Beaumains, who is afeard let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) flee, for it were shame to turn again sithen I have ridden so long with you.
<p/>Well, said the damosel, ye shall soon, whether ye will or not. CHAPTER X. How the third brother, called the Red Knight, jousted and fought against Beaumains, and how Beaumains overcame him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>).
<p/>And over the tower gate there hung a fifty shields of divers colours, and under that tower there was a fair meadow.
<p/>And therein were many knights and squires to behold, scaffolds and pavilions; for there upon the morn should be a great tournament: and the lord of the tower was in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) castle and looked out at a window, and saw a damosel, a dwarf, and a knight armed at all points.
<p/>So God me help, said the lord, with that knight will I joust, for I see that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is a knight-errant.
<p/>SO within a while they saw a tower as white as any snow, well matchecold all about, and double dyked. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) armed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and horsed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hastily.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was on horseback with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear, it was all red, both his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) harness, and all that to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) longeth.
<p/>And when that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) weened it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brother the Black Knight; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) cried aloud,
<p/>Nay, nay, said the damosel, it is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>); this is but a kitchen knave that was brought up for alms in King Arthur's court.
<p/>Ah, said the damosel, this knave hath killed thy brother, and Sir Kay named him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) Beaumains, and this horse and this harness was thy brother's, the Black Knight.
<p/>Brother, what do ye in these marches? Nevertheless, said the Red Knight, I will speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) or he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) depart. Also I saw thy brother the Green Knight overcome of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) hands.
<p/>With this either knights departed in sunder, and they came together with all their might, and either of their horses fell to the earth, and they avoided their horses, and put their shields afore them and drew their swords, and either gave other sad strokes, now here, now there, rasing, tracing, foining, and hurling like two boars, the space of two hours.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) cried on high to the Red Knight, Alas, thou noble Red Knight, think what worship hath followed thee, let never a kitchen knave endure thee so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) doth.
<p/>Then the Red Knight waxed wroth and doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) strokes, and hurt Beaumains wonderly sore, that the blood ran down to the ground, that it was wonder to see that strong battle.
<p/>Yet at the last Sir Beaumains struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) to the earth, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) would have slain the Red Knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) cried mercy, saying, Noble knight, slay me not, and I shall yield me to thee with fifty knights with me that be at my commandment.
<p/>And I forgive thee all the despite that thou hast done to me, and the death of my brother the Black Knight.
<p/>Now may ye be revenged upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), for I may never be quit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>). All this availeth not, said Beaumains, but if my damosel pray me to save thy life.
<p/>Let be, thou Beaumains, slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is a noble knight, and not so hardy, upon thine head, but thou save him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made semblant to strike off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head. Then Beaumains bade the Red Knight, Stand up, and thank the damosel now of thy life.
<p/>Then the Red Knight prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) castle, and to be there all night. So the damosel then granted him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), and there they had merry cheer.
<p/>But always the damosel spake many foul words unto Beaumains, whereof the Red Knight had great marvel; and all that night the Red Knight made three score knights to watch Beaumains, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) should have no shame nor villainy.
<p/>And upon the morn they heard mass and dined, and the Red Knight came before Beaumains with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) three score knights, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) proffered him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) homage and fealty at all times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) knights to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) service.
<p/>I thank you, said Beaumains, but this ye shall grant me: when I call upon you, to come afore my lord King Arthur, and yield you unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights.
<p/>Sir, said the Red Knight, I will be ready, and my fellowship, at your summons. So Sir Beaumains departed and the damosel, and ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) rode chiding him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in the foulest manner.
<p/>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Beaumains suffered great rebukes of the damosel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) suffered it patiently. DAMOSEL, said Beaumains, ye are uncourteous so to rebuke me as ye do, for meseemeth
<p/>I shall be beaten with knights that we meet, but ever for all your boast they lie in the dust or in the mire, and
<p/>therefore I pray you rebuke me no more; and when ye see me beaten or yielden as recreant, then may ye bid me go from you shamefully; but first I let you wit I will not depart from you, for I were worse than a fool an I would depart from you all the while that I win worship.
<p/>Well, said she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), right soon there shall meet a knight shall pay thee all thy wages, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is the most man of worship of the world, except King Arthur.
<p/>I will well, said Beaumains, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is of worship, the more shall be my worship to have ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>I have done you good service, and ever ye threaten me Then anon they were ware where was afore them a city rich and fair.
<p/>a mile and an half there was a fair meadow that seemed new mown, and therein were many pavilions fair to behold.
<p/>Lo, said the damosel, yonder is a lord that owneth yonder city, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) custom is, when the weather is fair, to lie in this meadow to joust and tourney.
<p/>And ever there be about him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) five hundred knights and gentlemen of arms, and there be all manner of games that any gentleman can devise.
<p/>Thou shalt see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) time enough, said the damosel, and so as she (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) rode near she (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) espied the pavilion where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was.
<p/>Lo, said she (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), seest thou yonder pavilion that is all of the colour of Inde, and all manner of thing that there is about, men and women, and horses trapped, shields and spears were all of the colour of Inde, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name is Sir Persant of Inde, the most lordliest knight that ever thou lookedst on.
<p/>It may well be, said Beaumains, but be he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) never so stout a knight, in this field I shall abide till that I see him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield.
<p/>And betwixt them and the city That goodly lord, said Beaumains, would I fain see. Ah, fool, said she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>), thou wert better flee betimes.
<p/>Why, said Beaumains, an he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) be such a knight as ye make him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will not set upon me with all his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) men, or with his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) five hundred knights.
<p/>For an there come no more but one at once, I shall him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) not fail whilst my life lasteth. Fie, fie, said the damosel, that ever such a stinking knave should blow such a boast.
<p/>Damosel, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said, ye are to blame so to rebuke me, for I had liefer do five battles than so to be rebuked, let him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) come and then let him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) do his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) worst.
<p/>Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>knave</b></font>) said, I marvel what thou art and of what kin thou art come; boldly thou speakest, and boldly thou hast done, that have I seen; therefore I pray thee save thyself an thou mayest, for thy horse and thou have had great travail, and I dread we dwell over long from the siege, for it is but hence seven mile, and all perilous passages we are passed save all only this passage; and here I dread me sore lest ye shall catch some hurt, therefore I would ye were hence, that ye were not bruised nor hurt with this strong knight.
<p/>But I let you wit that Sir Persant of Inde is nothing of might nor strength unto the knight that laid the siege about my lady.
<p/>As for that, said Sir Beaumains, be it as it be may. For sithen I am come so nigh this knight
<p/>I will prove his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might or I depart from him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and else I shall be shamed an I now withdraw me from him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And therefore, damosel, have ye no doubt by the grace of God I shall so deal with this knight that within two hours after noon I shall deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And then shall we come to the siege by daylight. O Jesu, marvel have I, said the damosel, what manner a man
<p/>ye be, for it may never be otherwise but that ye be come of a noble blood, for so foul nor shamefully did never woman rule a knight as I have done you, and ever courteously ye have suffered me, and that came never but of a gentle blood.
<p/>Damosel, said Beaumains, a knight may little do that may not suffer a damosel, for whatsomever ye said unto me I took none heed to your words, for the more ye said the more ye angered me, and my wrath I wreaked upon them that I had ado withal.
<p/>And therefore all the missaying that ye missaid me furthered me in my battle, and caused me to think to show and prove myself at the end what I was; for peradventure though I had meat in King Arthur's kitchen, yet I might have had meat enough in other places, but all that I did it for to prove and assay my friends, and that shall be known another day; and whether that I be a gentleman born or none, I let you wit, fair damosel, I have done you gentleman's service, and peradventure better service yet
<p/>will I do or I depart from you. Alas, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, fair Beaumains, forgive me all that I have missaid or done against thee.
<p/>With all my heart, said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), I forgive it you, for ye did nothing but as ye should do, for all your evil words pleased me; and damosel
<p/>, said Beaumains, since it liketh you to say thus fair unto me, wit ye well it gladdeth my heart greatly, and now meseemeth there is no knight living
<p/>but I am able enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). CHAPTER XII. How Beaumains fought with Sir Persant of Inde, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to be yielden.
<p/>WITH this Sir Persant of Inde had espied them as they hoved in the field, and knightly he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sent to them whether he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came in war or in peace.
<p/>Say to thy lord, said Beaumains, I take no force, but whether as him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) list himself. So the messenger went again unto Sir Persant and told him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) answer.
<p/>And Beaumains saw him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ready, and there they met with all that ever their horses might run, and brast their spears either in three pieces, and their horses rushed so together that both their horses fell dead to the earth; and lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields afore them, and drew their swords, and gave many great strokes that sometime they hurtled together that they fell grovelling on the ground.
<p/>Thus they fought two hours and more, that their shields and their hauberks were all forhewen, and in many steads they were wounded.
<p/>So at the last Sir Beaumains smote him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) through the cost of the body, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) retrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) here and there, and knightly maintained his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) battle long time.
<p/>And at the last, though him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) loath were, Beaumains smote Sir Persant above upon the helm, that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) fell grovelling to the earth; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) leapt upon him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) overthwart and unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) helm to have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).
<p/>Well then will I have ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) to the utterance, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) purveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and rode against him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). Then Sir Persant yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mercy.
<p/>With that came the damosel and prayed to save his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) life. I will well, for it were pity this noble knight should die.
<p/>that slew my brother the Black Knight at the black thorn; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was a full noble knight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) name was Sir Percard.
<p/>Also I am sure that ye are he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) that won mine other brother the Green Knight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) name was Sir Pertolepe.
<p/>Gramercy, said Persant, gentle knight and damosel. For certainly now I wot well it was ye Also ye won my brother the Red Knight, Sir Perimones.
<p/>And now since ye have won these, this shall I do for to please you: ye shall have homage and fealty of me, and an hundred knights to be always at your commandment, to go and ride where ye will command us.
<p/>And so they went unto Sir Persant's pavilion and drank the wine, and ate spices, and afterward Sir Persant made him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) to rest upon a bed until supper time, and after supper to bed again.
<p/>When Beaumains was abed, Sir Persant had a lady, a fair daughter of eighteen year of age, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), and charged her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) blessing to go unto the knight's bed, and lie down by his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) side, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) no strange cheer, but good cheer, and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in thine arms and kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), and look that this be done, I charge you, as ye will have my love and my good will.
<p/>So Sir Persant's daughter did as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father bade her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and so she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went unto Sir Beaumains' bed, and privily she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dispoiled her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) down by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
<p/>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) awoke and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was. Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said, I am Sir Persant's daughter, that by the commandment of my father am come hither.
<p/>God defend, said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), that I should defoil you to do Sir Persant such a shame; therefore, fair damosel, arise out of this bed or else I will.
<p/>Be ye a maid or a wife? said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, I am a clean maiden. Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, I came not to you by mine own will, but as I was commanded.
<p/>and so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) departed and came unto Sir Persant her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) all how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had sped.
<p/>Alas, said Sir Beaumains, I were a shameful knight an I would do your father any disworship; Truly, said Sir Persant, whatsomever he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) be, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is come of a noble blood.
<p/>And so we leave them there till on the morn. CHAPTER XIII. Of the goodly communication between Sir Persant and Beaumains, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) name was Sir Gareth.
<p/>AND so on the morn the damosel and Sir Beaumains heard mass and brake their fast, and so took their leave.
<p/>Fair damosel, said Persant, whitherward are ye way-leading this knight? Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, this knight is going to the siege that besiegeth my sister in the Castle Dangerous.
<p/>Ah, ah, said Persant, that is the Knight of the Red Laund, the which is the most perilous knight that I know now living, and
<p/>God save you, said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to Beaumains, from that knight, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) doth great wrong to that lady, and that is great pity, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is one of the fairest ladies of the world, and meseemeth that your damosel is her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister: is not your name Linet?
<p/>a man that is without mercy, and men say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hath seven men's strength. said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Yea, sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and my lady my sister's name is Dame Lionesse.
<p/>Now shall I tell you, said Sir Persant, this Red Knight of the Red Laund hath lain long at the siege, well-nigh this two years, and many times he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) might have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) an he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) had
<p/>would, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) prolongeth the time to this intent, for to have Sir Launcelot du Lake to do battle with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), or Sir Tristram, or Sir Lamorak de Galis, or Sir Gawaine, and this is his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) tarrying so long at the siege.
<p/>Now my lord Sir Persant of Inde, said the damosel Linet, I require you that ye will make this gentleman knight or ever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fight with the Red Knight.
<p/>I will with all my heart, said Sir Persant, an it please him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) to take the order of knighthood of so simple a man as I am.
<p/>Sir, said Beaumains, I thank you for your good will, for I am better sped, for certainly the noble knight Sir Launcelot made me knight.
<p/>Ah, said Sir Persant, of a more renowned knight might ye not be made knight; for of all knights he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) may be called chief of knighthood; and so all the world saith
<p/>, that betwixt three knights is departed clearly knighthood, that is Launcelot du Lake, Sir Tristram de Liones, and Sir Lamorak de Galis: these bear now the renown.
<p/>There be many other knights, as Sir Palamides the Saracen and Sir Safere his (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) brother; also Sir Bleoberis and Sir Blamore de Ganis his (<font color='blue'><b>Ganis</b></font>) brother; also Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Ector de Maris and Sir Percivale de Galis; these and many more be noble knights, but there be none that pass the three above said; therefore God speed you well, said Sir Persant, for an ye may match the Red Knight ye shall be called the fourth of the world.
<p/>I came of good men, for I dare say my father was a noble man, and so that ye will keep it in close, and
<p/>Sir, said Beaumains, I would fain be of good fame and of knighthood. And I let you wit this damosel, I will tell you of what kin I am.
<p/>Truly then, said he (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>), my name is Gareth of Orkney, and King Lot was my father, and my mother is King Arthur's sister, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name is Dame Morgawse, and Sir Gawaine is my brother, and Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris, and I am the youngest of them all.
<p/>We will not discover you, said they both, till ye command us, by the faith we owe unto God. And yet wot not King Arthur nor Sir Gawaine what I am.
<p/>How the lady that was besieged had word from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had brought a knight to fight for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and what battles he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had achieved.
<p/>SO the book saith that the lady that was besieged had word of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister's coming by the dwarf, and a knight with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and how he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had passed all the perilous passages.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is a noble knight, truly, madam, said the dwarf, and but a young man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is as likely a man as ever ye saw any.
<p/>CHAPTER XIV. What manner a man is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? said the lady. What is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? said the damosel, and of what kin is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come, and of whom was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made knight?
<p/>Madam, said the dwarf, he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) is the king's son of Orkney, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Orkney</b></font>) name I will not tell you as at this time; but wit ye well, of Sir Launcelot
<p/>was he (<font color='blue'><b>Orkney</b></font>) made knight, for of none other would he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be made knight, and Sir Kay named him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) Beaumains. How escaped he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), said the lady, from the brethren of Persant?
<p/>Ah! said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), they were good knights, but they were murderers, the one hight Gherard le Breuse, and the other knight hight Sir Arnold le Breuse.
<p/>Then, madam, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) recountered with the Black Knight, and slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in plain battle, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) armour and fought with the Green Knight and won him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in plain battle, and in like wise he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) served the Red Knight, and after in the same wise he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) served the Blue Knight and won him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in plain battle.
<p/>Then, said the lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) hath overcome Sir Persant of Inde, one of the noblest knights of the world, and the dwarf said, He (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) hath won all the four brethren and slain the Black Knight, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) did more to-fore: he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) overthrew Sir Kay and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) nigh dead upon the ground; also he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) did a great battle with Sir Launcelot, and there they departed on even hands: and then Sir Launcelot made him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) knight.
<p/>Dwarf, said the lady, I am glad of these tidings, therefore go thou in an hermitage of mine hereby, and there shalt thou bear with thee of my wine in two flagons of silver, they are of two gallons, and also two cast of bread with fat venison baked, and dainty fowls; and a cup of gold here
<p/>I deliver thee, that is rich and precious; and bear all this to mine hermitage, and put it in the hermit's hands.
<p/>And sithen go thou unto my sister and greet her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) well, and commend me unto that gentle knight, and pray him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to eat and to drink and make him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) strong, and say ye him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)
<p/>I thank him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) courtesy and goodness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would take upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) such labour for me that never did him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bounty nor courtesy.
<p/>Also pray him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be of good heart and courage, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall meet with a full noble knight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is neither of bounty, courtesy, nor gentleness; for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) attendeth unto nothing but to murder, and that is the cause I cannot praise him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) nor love him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>So this dwarf departed, and came to Sir Persant, where he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) found the damosel Linet and Sir Beaumains, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) told them all as ye have heard; and then they took their leave, but Sir Persant took an ambling hackney and conveyed them on their ways, and then beleft them to God; and so within a little while they came to that hermitage, and there they drank the wine, and ate the venison and the fowls baken.
<p/>And so when they had repasted them well, the dwarf returned again with his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) vessel unto the castle again; and there met with him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) from whence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) came, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) had been.
<p/>Sir, said the dwarf, I have been with my lady's sister of this castle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hath been at King Arthur's court, and brought a knight with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).
<p/>Then I account her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) travail but lost; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram, Sir Lamorak, or Sir Gawaine, I would think myself good enough for them all.
<p/>It may well be, said the dwarf, but this knight hath passed all the perilous passages, and slain the Black Knight and other two more, and won the Green Knight, the Red Knight, and the Blue Knight.
<p/>Madam, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) said, as a noble knight should. First, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slew two brethren at a passage of a water. Then is he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) one of these four that I have afore rehearsed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is none of those, said the dwarf, but he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) is a king's son. What is his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) name? said the Red Knight of the Red Launds.
<p/>That will I not tell you, said the dwarf, but Sir Kay upon scorn named him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) Beaumains. I care not, said the knight, what knight so ever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be, for I shall soon deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And if I ever match him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall have a shameful death as many other have had. That were pity, said the dwarf, and it is marvel that ye make such shameful war upon noble knights.
<p/>How the damosel and Beaumains came to the siege; and came to a sycamore tree, and there Beaumains blew a horn, and then the Knight of the Red Launds came to fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>).
<p/>NOW leave we the knight and the dwarf, and speak we of Beaumains, that all night lay in the hermitage; and upon the morn he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and the damosel Linet heard their mass and brake their fast.
<p/>And then they took their horses and rode throughout a fair forest; and then they came to a plain, and saw where were many pavilions and tents, and a fair castle, and there was much smoke and great noise; and when they came near the siege Sir Beaumains espied upon great trees, as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode, how there hung full goodly armed knights by the neck, and their shields about their necks with their swords, and gilt spurs upon their heels, and so there hung nigh a forty knights shamefully with full rich arms.
<p/>Fair sir, said the damosel, abate not your cheer for all this sight, for ye must courage yourself, or else ye be all shent, for all these knights came hither to this siege to rescue my sister Dame Lionesse, and when the Red Knight of the Red Launds had overcome them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) put them to this shameful death without mercy and pity.
<p/>CHAPTER XV. Then Sir Beaumains abated his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) countenance and said, What meaneth this? And in the same wise he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) will serve you but if you quit you the better.
<p/>Now Jesu defend me, said Beaumains, from such a villainous death and shenship of arms. For rather than I should so be faren withal, I would rather be slain manly in plain battle.
<p/>So were ye better, said the damosel; for trust not, in him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is no courtesy, but all goeth to the death or shameful murder, and that is pity, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is a full likely man, well made of body, and a full noble knight of prowess, and a lord of great lands and possessions.
<p/>Truly, said Beaumains, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) may well be a good knight, but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) useth shameful customs, and it is marvel that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) endureth so long that none of the noble knights of my lord Arthur's have not dealt with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>And then they rode to the dykes, and saw them double dyked with full warlike walls; and there were lodged many great lords nigh the walls; and there was great noise of minstrelsy; and the sea beat upon the one side of the walls, where were many ships and mariners' noise with <div class="bookquote">``hale and how.
<p/>And also there was fast by a sycamore tree, and there hung an horn, the greatest that ever they saw, of an elephant's bone; and this Knight of the Red Launds had hanged it up there, that if there came any errant-knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) must blow that horn, and then will he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) make him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) ready and come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) to do battle.
<p/>not the horn till it be high noon, for now it is about prime, and now increaseth his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) might, that as men say he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) hath seven men's strength.
<p/>Ah, fie for shame, fair damosel, say ye never so more to me; for, an he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) were as good a knight as ever was, I shall never fail him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) most might, for either I will win worship worshipfully, or die knightly in the field.
<p/>And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) spurred his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) horse straight to the sycamore tree, and blew so the horn eagerly that all the siege and the castle rang thereof.
<p/>And then there leapt out knights out of their tents and pavilions, and they within the castle looked over the walls and out at windows.
<p/>Then the Red Knight of the Red Launds armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) hastily, and two barons set on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) spurs upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) heels, and all was blood red, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) armour, spear and shield.
<p/>And an earl buckled his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) helm upon his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) head, and then they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) a red spear and a red steed, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) rode into a little vale under the castle, that all that were in the castle and at the siege might behold the battle.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>mariners</b></font>)</div>But, sir, I pray you, said the damosel Linet, blow ye CHAPTER XVI. How the two knights met together, and of their talking, and how they began their battle.
<p/>SIR, said the damosel Linet unto Sir Beaumains, look ye be glad and light, for yonder is your deadly enemy, and at yonder window is my lady, my sister, Dame Lionesse.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) beseemeth afar the fairest lady that ever I looked upon; and truly, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, I ask no better quarrel than now for to do battle, for truly she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) shall be my lady, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) I will fight.
<p/>And ever he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked up to the window with glad countenance, and the Lady Lionesse made curtsey to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) down to the earth, with holding up both their hands.
<p/>With that the Red Knight of the Red Launds called to Sir Beaumains, Leave, sir knight, thy looking, and behold me, I counsel thee; for I warn thee
<p/>Where? said Beaumains. Yonder, said the damosel, and pointed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) finger. That is truth, said Beaumains. well she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) is my lady, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) I have done many strong battles.
<p/>If thou have so done, said Beaumains, meseemeth it was but waste labour, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) loveth none of thy fellowship, and thou to love that loveth not thee is but great folly.
<p/>For an I understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) were not glad of my coming, I would be advised or I did battle for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>).
<p/>And therefore wit thou well, thou Red Knight of the Red Launds, I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>), and will rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>), or else to die.
<p/>Sayst thou that? said the Red Knight, meseemeth thou ought of reason to be ware by yonder knights that thou sawest hang upon yonder trees.
<p/>Fie for shame, said Beaumains, that ever thou shouldest say or do so evil, for in that thou shamest thyself and knighthood, and thou mayst be sure there will no lady love thee that knoweth thy wicked customs.
<p/>But I understand by the besieging of this castle she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may forbear thy fellowship. And now thou weenest that the sight of these hanged knights should fear me.
<p/>; that shameful sight causeth me to have courage and hardiness against thee, more than I would have had against thee an thou wert a well-ruled knight.
<p/>Nay truly, not so Make thee ready, said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and talk no longer with me.
<p/>Then Sir Beaumains bade the damosel go from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>); and then they put their spears in their rests, and came together with all their might that they had both, and either smote other in midst of their shields that the paitrelles, surcingles, and cruppers brast, and fell to the earth both, and the reins of their bridles in their hands; and so they lay a great while sore astonied, that all that were in the castle and in the siege weened their necks had been broken; and then many a stranger and other said the strange knight was a big man, and a noble jouster, for or
<p/>now we saw never no knight match the Red Knight of the Red Launds: thus they said, both within the castle and without.
<p/>Then lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields afore them, and drew their swords and ran together like two fierce lions, and either gave other such buffets upon their helms that they reeled backward both two strides; and then they recovered both, and hewed great pieces off their harness and their shields that a great part fell into the fields.
<p/>How after long fighting Beaumains overcame the knight and would have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), but at the request of the lords he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saved his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to yield him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to the lady.
<p/>AND then thus they fought till it was past noon, and never would stint, till at the last they lacked wind both; and then they stood wagging and scattering, panting, blowing and bleeding, that all that beheld them for the most part wept for pity.
<p/>CHAPTER XVII. So when they had rested them a while they yede to battle again, tracing, racing, foining as two boars.
<p/>And at some time they took their run as it had been two rams, and hurtled together that sometime they fell grovelling to the earth: and at some time they were so amazed that either took other's sword instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own.
<p/>might know whether was like to win the battle; and their armour was so forhewn that men might see their naked sides; and in other places they were naked, but ever the naked places they did defend.
<p/>And the Red Knight was a wily knight of war, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) wily fighting taught Sir Beaumains to be wise; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) abought it full sore or he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) did espy his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fighting.
<p/>And thus by assent of them both they granted either other to rest; and so they set them down upon two mole-hills there beside the fighting place, and either of them unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) helm, and took the cold wind; for either of their pages was fast by them, to come when they called to unlace their harness and to set them on again at their commandment.
<p/>And then when Sir Beaumains' helm was off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) looked up to the window, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) saw the fair lady Dame Lionesse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) such countenance that his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) heart waxed light and jolly; and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) bade the Red Knight of the Red Launds make him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) ready, and let us do the battle to the utterance.
<p/>I will well, said the knight, and then they laced up their helms, and their pages avoided, and they stepped together and fought freshly; but the Red Knight of the Red Launds awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), and at an overthwart smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) within the hand, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) sword fell out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) hand; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) another buffet upon the helm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fell grovelling to the earth, and the Red Knight fell over him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), for to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) down.
<p/>Thus they endured till evensong time, that there was none that beheld them Then cried the maiden Linet on high: O Sir Beaumains, where is thy courage become?
<p/>When Sir Beaumains heard her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) say so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) abraid up with a great might and gat him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) feet, and lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) leapt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) sword and gripped it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) hand, and doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) pace unto the Red Knight, and there they fought a new battle together.
<p/>But Sir Beaumains then doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) strokes, and smote so thick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) smote the sword out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) hand, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) upon the helm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fell to the earth, and Sir Beaumains fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), and unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) helm to have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>); and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) and asked mercy, and said with a loud voice: O noble knight, I yield me to thy mercy.
<p/>Then Sir Beaumains bethought him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) upon the knights that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had made to be hanged shamefully, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said: I may not with my worship save thy life, for the shameful deaths that thou hast caused many full good knights to die.
<p/>Sir, said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, hold your hand and ye shall know the causes why I put them to so shameful a death.
<p/>Alas, my lady my sister beholdeth thee, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sobbeth and weepeth, that maketh mine heart heavy. Say on, said Sir Beaumains.
<p/>Sir, I loved once a lady, a fair damosel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother slain; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said it was Sir Launcelot du Lake, or else Sir Gawaine; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prayed me as that I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heartily, that I would make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a promise by the faith of my knighthood, for to labour daily in arms unto I met with one of them; and all that I might overcome I should put them unto a villainous death; and this is the cause that I have put all these knights to death, and so I ensured her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to do all the villainy unto King Arthur's knights, and that I should take vengeance upon all these knights.
<p/>And, sir, now I will thee tell that every day my strength increaseth till noon, and all this time have I seven men's strength.
<p/>How the knight yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and how Beaumains made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to go unto King Arthur's court, and to cry Sir Launcelot mercy.
<p/>THEN came there many earls, and barons, and noble knights, and prayed that knight to save his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life, and take him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to your prisoner.
<p/>And all they fell upon their knees, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of mercy, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would save his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life; and, Sir, they all said, it were fairer of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to take homage and fealty, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hold his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lands of you than for to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); by his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) death ye shall have none advantage, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) misdeeds that be done may not be undone; and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall make amends to all parties, and we all will become your men and do you homage and fealty.
<p/>, nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath done passing ill and shamefully; but insomuch all that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did was at a lady's request I blame him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) the less; and so for your sake I will release him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall have his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life upon this covenant, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) go within the castle, and yield him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) there to the lady, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will forgive and quit him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), I will well; with this he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) amends of all the trespass he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath done against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lands.
<p/>And also, when that is done, that ye go unto the court of King Arthur, and there that ye ask Sir Launcelot mercy, and Sir Gawaine, for the evil will ye have had against them.
<p/>Sir, said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, all this will I do as ye command, and siker assurance and borrows
<p/>And so then when the assurance was made, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) homage and fealty, and all those earls and barons with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>).
<p/>And then the maiden Linet came to Sir Beaumains, and unarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) and searched his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) wounds, and stinted his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) blood, and in likewise she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) did to the Red Knight of the Red Launds.
<p/>And there they sojourned ten days in their tents; and the Red Knight made his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) lords and servants to do all the pleasure that they might unto Sir Beaumains.
<p/>And so within a while the Red Knight of the Red Launds yede unto the castle, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) grace.
<p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) upon sufficient surety, so all her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) hurts were well restored of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) could complain.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) departed unto the court of King Arthur, and there openly the Red Knight of the Red Launds put him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in the mercy of Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) told openly how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was overcome and by whom, and also he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) told all the battles from the beginning unto the ending.
<p/>Jesu mercy, said King Arthur and Sir Gawaine, we marvel much of what blood he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is come, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is a noble knight.
<p/>CHAPTER XVIII. Fair lords, said Beaumains, wit you well I am full loath to slay this knight ye shall have. Have ye no marvel, said Sir Launcelot, for ye
<p/>right well wit that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is come of a full noble blood; and as for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might and hardiness, there be but few now living that is so mighty as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is, and so noble of prowess.
<p/>It seemeth by you, said King Arthur, that ye know his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) name, and from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is come, and of what blood he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is.
<p/>I suppose I do so, said Launcelot, or else I would not have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the order of knighthood; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) gave me such charge at that time that I should never discover him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) required me, or else it be known openly by some other.
<p/>How Beaumains came to the lady, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came to the castle the gates were closed against him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and of the words that the lady said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>shall CHAPTER XIX NOW turn we unto Sir Beaumains that desired of Linet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lady.
<p/>Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, I would fain ye saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Then Sir Beaumains all armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) spear, and rode straight unto the castle.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came to the gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) found there many men armed, and pulled up the drawbridge and drew the port close.
<p/>Then marvelled he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) why they would not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to enter. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) looked up to the window; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw the fair Lionesse that said on high:
<p/>Go thy way, Sir Beaumains, for as yet thou shalt not have wholly my love, unto the time that thou be called one of the number of the worthy knights.
<p/>Alas, fair lady, said Beaumains, I have not deserved that ye should show me this strangeness, and I had weened that I should have right good cheer with you, and unto my power I have deserved thank, and
<p/>And therefore go labour in worship this twelvemonth, and then thou shalt hear new tidings. well I am sure I have bought your love with part of the best blood within my body.
<p/>for wit you well your great travail nor good love shall not be lost, for I consider your great travail and labour, your bounty and your goodness as me ought to do.
<p/>And therefore go on your way, and look that ye be of good comfort, for all shall be for your worship and for the best, and perdy a twelvemonth will soon be done, and trust me, fair knight, I shall be true to you, and never to betray you, but to my death I shall love you and none other.
<p/>And therewithal she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) from the window, and Sir Beaumains rode awayward from the castle, making great dole, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode here and there and wist not where he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode, till it was dark night.
<p/>Fair courteous knight, said Dame Lionesse, be not displeased nor over-hasty; And then it happened him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to come to a poor man's house, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was harboured all that night.
<p/>And so upon the morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and rode until underne, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came to a broad water, and thereby was a great lodge, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) alighted to sleep and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head upon the shield, and betook his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse to the dwarf, and commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to watch all night.
<p/>Now turn we to the lady of the same castle, that thought much upon Beaumains, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) called unto her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Sir Gringamore her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in all manner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heartily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would ride after Sir Beaumains: And ever have ye wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) till ye may find him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sleeping, for I am sure in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heaviness he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will alight down in some place, and lie him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) down to sleep; and therefore have ye your wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and in the priviest manner ye can, take his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dwarf, and go ye your way with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as fast as ever ye may or Sir Beaumains awake.
<p/>For my sister Linet telleth me that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) can tell of what kindred he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is come, and what is his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) right name.
<p/>And the meanwhile I and my sister will ride unto your castle to await when ye bring with you the dwarf.
<p/>But Sir Beaumains had no rest, but wallowed and writhed for the love of the lady of the castle. And then when ye have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) unto your castle, I will have him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) in examination myself.
<p/>Unto the time that I know what is his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) right name, and of what kindred he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) is come, shall I never be merry at my heart.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) rode all the other day and the night till that he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) found Sir Beaumains lying by a water, and his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) shield, for to sleep.
<p/>And then when he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) saw Sir Beaumains fast asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) came stilly stalking behind the dwarf, and plucked him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) fast under his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) arm, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) rode away with him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) as fast as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) might unto his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) own castle.
<p/>Sister, said Sir Gringamore, all this shall be done after your intent. And this Sir Gringamore's arms were all black, and that to him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) longeth.
<p/>But ever as he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) rode with the dwarf toward his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) castle, he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) cried unto his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) lord and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) of help.
<p/>And therewith awoke Sir Beaumains, and up he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) leapt lightly, and saw where Sir Gringamore rode his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) way with the dwarf, and so Sir Gringamore rode out of his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) sight.
<p/>THEN Sir Beaumains put on his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) helm anon, and buckled his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) shield, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) horse, and rode after him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) all that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) might ride through marshes, and fields, and great dales, that many times his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) horse and he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) plunged over the head in deep mires, for he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) knew not the way, but took the gainest way in that woodness, that many times he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) was like to perish.
<p/>And at the last him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) happened to come to a fair green way, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) met with a poor man of the country, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) saluted and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) met not with a knight upon a black horse and all black harness, a little dwarf sitting behind him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) with heavy cheer.
<p/>Sir, said the poor man, here by me came Sir Gringamore the knight, with such a dwarf mourning as ye say; and therefore I rede you not follow him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) is one of the periloust knights of the world, and
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) castle is here nigh hand but two mile; therefore we advise you ride not after Sir Gringamore, but if ye owe him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) good will.
<p/>CHAPTER XX. How Sir Beaumains rode after to rescue his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) dwarf, and came into the castle where he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) was. So leave we Sir Beaumains riding toward the castle, and speak we of Sir Gringamore and the dwarf.
<p/>Anon as the dwarf was come to the castle, Dame Lionesse and Dame Linet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) sister, asked the dwarf where was his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) master born, and of what lineage he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) was come.
<p/>And but if thou tell me, said Dame Lionesse, thou shalt never escape this castle, but ever here to be prisoner.
<p/>As for that, said the dwarf, I fear not greatly to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) name and of what kin he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) is come.
<p/>well he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) is a king's son, and his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) mother is sister to King Arthur, and he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) is brother to the good knight Sir Gawaine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) name is Sir Gareth of Orkney.
<p/>And now I have told you his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) right name, I pray you, fair lady, let me go to my lord again, for he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) will never out of this country until that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) have me again.
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) be angry he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) will do much harm or that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) be stint, and work you wrack in this country.
<p/>And so they washed and went to meat, and made them merry and well at ease, and because the Lady Lionesse of the castle was there, they made great joy.
<p/>Truly, madam, said Linet unto her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) sister, well may he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) be a king's son, for he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hath many good tatches on him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is courteous and mild, and the most suffering man that ever I met withal.
<p/>For I dare say there was never gentlewoman reviled man in so foul a manner as I have rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and at all times he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me goodly and meek answers again.
<p/>And as they sat thus talking, there came Sir Gareth in at the gate with an angry countenance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) sword drawn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) hand, and cried aloud that all the castle might hear it, saying: Thou traitor, Sir Gringamore, deliver me my dwarf again, or by the faith that I owe to the order of knighthood, I shall do thee all the harm that I can.
<p/>Then Sir Gringamore looked out at a window and said, Sir Gareth of Orkney, leave thy boasting words, for thou gettest not thy dwarf again.
<p/>Thou coward knight, said Sir Gareth, bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) with thee, and come and do battle with me, and win him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>Wit you As for that threatening, said Sir Gringamore, be it as it be may, we will go to dinner. So will I do, said Sir Gringamore, an me list, but for all thy great words thou gettest him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) not.
<p/>Ah! fair brother, said Dame Lionesse, I would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dwarf again, for I would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were not wroth, for now he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hath told me all my desire
<p/>And also, brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hath done much for me, and delivered me from the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and therefore, brother, I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) my service afore all knights living.
<p/>I keep no more of the dwarf. And wit ye well that I love him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) before all other, and full fain
<p/>I would speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>). But in nowise I would that he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) wist what I were, but that I were another strange lady.
<p/>And right therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) went down unto Sir Gareth, and said: Sir, I cry you mercy, and all that I have misdone I will amend it at your will.
<p/>And therefore I pray you that ye would alight, and take such cheer as I can make you in this castle.
<p/>Well, said Sir Gringamore, sithen I know now your will, I will obey now unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>). Shall I have my dwarf? said Sir Gareth.
<p/>Yea, sir, and all the pleasaunce that I can make you, for as soon as your dwarf told me what ye were and of what blood ye are come, and what noble deeds ye have done in these marches, then I repented of my deeds.
<p/>And then Sir Gareth alighted, and there came his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) dwarf and took his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) horse. O my fellow, said Sir Gareth, I have had many adventures for thy sake.
<p/>And so Sir Gringamore took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) by the hand and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) into the hall where his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) own wife was. CHAPTER XXI.
<p/>How Sir Gareth, otherwise called Beaumains, came to the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) lady, and how they took acquaintance, and of their love.
<p/>Dame Lionesse arrayed like a princess, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) passing good cheer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) again; and they had goodly language and lovely countenance together.
<p/>And Sir Gareth thought many times, Jesu, would that the lady of the Castle Perilous were so fair as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was.
<p/>And ever the more Sir Gareth beheld that lady, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) burned in love that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was past himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) reason; and forth toward night they yede unto supper, and Sir Gareth might not eat, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) love was so hot that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) wist not where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was.
<p/>All these looks espied Sir Gringamore, and then at-after supper he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) sister Dame Lionesse into a chamber, and said: Fair sister, I have well espied your countenance betwixt you and this knight, and I will, sister, that
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is a full noble knight, and if ye can make him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to abide here I will do him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) all the pleasure that I can
<p/>AND then came forth There were all manner of games and plays, of dancing and singing. ye wit , for an ye were better than ye are, ye were well bywaryd upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Fair brother, said Dame Lionesse , I understand well that the knight is good, and come he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is of a noble house.
<p/>Notwithstanding, I will assay him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) better, howbeit I am most beholden to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of any earthly man; for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath had great labour for my love, and passed many a dangerous passage.
<p/>Right so Sir Gringamore went unto Sir Gareth, and said, Sir, make ye good cheer, for ye shall have none other cause, for this lady, my sister, is yours at all times, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) worship saved, for wit
<p/>ye well she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loveth you as well as ye do her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and better if better may be. An I wist that, said Sir Gareth, there lived not a gladder man than I would be.
<p/>ye shall sojourn with me, and this lady shall be with us daily and nightly to make you all the cheer that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can.
<p/>Upon my worship, said Sir Gringamore, trust unto my promise; and as long as it liketh you I will well, said Sir Gareth, for I have promised to be nigh this country this twelvemonth.
<p/>And well I am sure King Arthur and other noble knights will find me where that I am within this twelvemonth.
<p/>And then the noble knight Sir Gareth went unto the Dame Lionesse, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) then much loved, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) many times, and either made great joy of other.
<p/>For I shall be sought and found, if that I be alive. And there she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) love certainly, to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) and none other the days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) life.
<p/>Then this lady, Dame Lionesse, by the assent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) brother, told Sir Gareth all the truth what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) was, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) was the same lady that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) did battle for, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) was lady of the Castle Perilous, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) brother to take away his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dwarf, -LSB-*2-RSB-for this cause, to know the certainty what was your name, and of what kin ye were come.
<p/>How at night came an armed knight, and fought with Sir Gareth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), sore hurt in the thigh, smote off the knight's head.
<p/>-LSB-*2-RSB- Printed by Caxton as part of chap. xxii. CHAPTER XXII. AND then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) let fetch to-fore him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) Linet, the damosel that had ridden with him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) many wildsome ways.
<p/>Then was Sir Gareth more gladder than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was to-fore. And then they troth-plight each other to love, and never to fail whiles their life lasteth.
<p/>And so they burnt both in love, that they were accorded to abate their lusts secretly. And there Dame Lionesse counselled Sir Gareth to sleep in none other place but in the hall.
<p/>And there she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bed a little afore midnight. This counsel was not so privily kept
<p/>but it was understood; for they were but young both, and tender of age, and had not used none such crafts to-fore.
<p/>Wherefore the damosel Linet was a little displeased, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) sister Dame Lionesse was a little over-hasty, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) might not abide the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) marriage; and for saving their worship, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) thought to abate their hot lusts.
<p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) let ordain by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) subtle crafts that they had not their intents neither with other, as in their delights, until they were married.
<p/>And so it passed on. At-after supper was made clean avoidance, that every lord and lady should go unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) rest.
<p/>But Sir Gareth said plainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) would go no farther than the hall, for in such places, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) said, was convenient for an errant-knight to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) rest in; and so there were ordained great couches, and thereon feather beds, and there laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) down to sleep; and within a while came Dame Lionesse, wrapped in a mantle furred with ermine, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) down beside Sir Gareth.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) looked afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) apperceived and saw come an armed knight, with many lights about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>); and this knight had a long gisarm in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand, and made grim countenance to smite him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>When Sir Gareth saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) come in that wise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) leapt out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bed, and gat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) sword, and leapt straight toward that knight.
<p/>And when the knight saw Sir Gareth come so fiercely upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) with a foin through the thick of the thigh that the wound was a shaftmon broad and had cut a-two many veins and sinews.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Gareth smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) upon the helm such a buffet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) fell grovelling; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) leapt over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) and unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) helm, and smote off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) head from the body.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bled so fast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) might not stand, but so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bed, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) swooned and lay as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had been dead.
<p/>And therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) began to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>). Then Dame Lionesse cried aloud, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) brother Sir Gringamore heard, and came down.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw Sir Gareth so shamefully wounded he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was sore displeased, and said: I am shamed that this noble knight is thus honoured.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Gringamore, how may this be, that ye be here, and this noble knight wounded? Brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) said, I can not tell you, for it was not done by me, nor by mine assent.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) is my lord and I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) must be mine husband ; therefore, my brother, I will that ye wit
<p/>Sister, said Sir Gringamore, and I will that ye wit it, and Sir Gareth both, that it was never done by me, nor by my assent that this unhappy deed was done.
<p/>I shame me not to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), nor to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) all the pleasure that I can. And there they staunched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bleeding as well as they might, and great sorrow made Sir Gringamore and Dame Lionesse.
<p/>And forthwithal came Dame Linet, and took up the head in the sight of them all, and anointed it with an ointment thereas it was smitten off; and in the same wise she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) did to the other part thereas the head stuck, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) set it together, and it stuck as fast as ever it did.
<p/>All this saw Sir Gringamore and Dame Lionesse, and so did Sir Gareth; and well he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) espied that it was the damosel Linet,
<p/>And the knight arose lightly up, and the damosel Linet put him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) chamber. that rode with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) through the perilous passages.
<p/>My lord Gareth, said Linet, all that I have done I will avow, and all that I have done shall be for your honour and worship, and to us all.
<p/>And so within a while Sir Gareth was nigh whole, and waxed light and jocund, and sang, danced, and gamed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) and Dame Lionesse were so hot in burning love that they made their covenant at the tenth night after, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) should come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bed.
<p/>Ah well, damosel, said Sir Gareth, I weened ye would not have done as ye have done. And because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was wounded afore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) armour and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) sword
<p/>How the said knight came again the next night and was beheaded again, and how at the feast of Pentecost all the knights that Sir Gareth had overcome came and yielded them to King Arthur.
<p/>nigh his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bed's side. CHAPTER XXIII. RIGHT as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) promised she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) came; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) was not so soon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bed
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) warned Sir Gareth, and lightly through the good help of Dame Lionesse he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was armed; and they hurtled together with great ire and malice all about the hall; and there was great light as it had been the number of twenty torches both before and behind, so that Sir Gareth strained him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) old wound brast again a-bleeding; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was hot and courageous and took no keep, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) great force he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) struck down that knight, and voided his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) helm, and struck off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) head.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had done so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) took up all those pieces, and threw them out at a window into the ditches of the castle; and by this done he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was so faint that unnethes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) might stand for bleeding.
<p/>And by when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was almost unarmed he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) fell in a deadly swoon on the floor; and then Dame Lionesse cried so that Sir Gringamore heard; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) came and found Sir Gareth in that plight he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) made great sorrow; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) awaked Sir Gareth, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) a drink that relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) wonderly well; but the sorrow that Dame Lionesse made there may no tongue tell, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) so fared with herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) would have died.
<p/>Right so came this damosel Linet before them all, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) had fetched all the gobbets of the head that Sir Gareth had thrown out at a window, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) anointed them as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) had done to-fore, and set them together again.
<p/>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) espied an armed knight coming toward the bed: therewithal Then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hewed the head in an hundred pieces. Well, damosel Linet, said Sir Gareth, I have not deserved all this despite that ye do unto me.
<p/>Sir knight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) said, I have nothing done but I will avow, and all that I have done shall be to your worship, and to us all.
<p/>And then was Sir Gareth staunched of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bleeding. But the leeches said that there was no man that bare the life should heal him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) throughout of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) wound
<p/>So leave we Sir Gareth there with Sir Gringamore and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) sisters, and turn we unto King Arthur, that at the next feast of Pentecost held his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) feast; and there came the Green Knight with fifty knights, and yielded them all unto King Arthur.
<p/>And so there came the Red Knight his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) brother, and yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) to King Arthur, and three score knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>Also there came the Blue Knight, brother to them, with an hundred knights, and yielded them unto King Arthur; and the Green Knight's name was Pertolepe, and the Red Knight's name was Perimones, and the Blue Knight's name was Sir Persant of Inde.
<p/>These three brethren told King Arthur how they were overcome by a knight that a damosel had with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), and called him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) Beaumains.
<p/>but if they healed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that caused that stroke by enchantment. Jesu, said the king, I marvel what knight he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is, and of what lineage he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is come.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was with me a twelvemonth, and poorly and shamefully he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was fostered, and Sir Kay in scorn named him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) Beaumains.
<p/>So right as the king stood so talking with these three brethren, there came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told the king that there was come a goodly lord with six hundred knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>Then the king went out of Carlion, for there was the feast, and there came to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) this lord, and saluted the king in a goodly manner.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said, my name is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, but my name is Sir Ironside; and sir, wit ye well, here I am sent to you of a knight that is called Beaumains, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) won me in plain battle hand for hand, and so did never no knight
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), that ever had the better of me this thirty winter; the which commanded to yield me to you at your will.
<p/>Ye are welcome, said the king, for ye have been long a great foe to me and my court, and now I trust to God
<p/>What will ye, said King Arthur, and what is your errand? I shall so entreat you that ye shall be my friend.
<p/>Sir, both I and these five hundred knights shall always be at your summons to do you service as may lie in our powers.
<p/>Jesu mercy, said King Arthur, I am much beholden unto that knight that hath put so his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) body in devoir to worship me and my court.
<p/>And as to thee, Ironside, that art called the Red Knight of the Red Launds, thou art called a perilous knight; and if thou wilt hold of me I shall worship thee and make thee knight of the Table Round; but then thou must be no more a murderer.
<p/>Sir, as to that, I have promised unto Sir Beaumains never more to use such customs, for all the shameful customs that I used I did at the request of a lady that I loved; and therefore I must go unto Sir Launcelot, and unto Sir Gawaine, and ask them forgiveness of the evil will I had unto them; for all that I put to death was all only for the love of Sir Launcelot and of Sir Gawaine.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) kneeled down unto Sir Launcelot, and to Sir Gawaine, and prayed them of forgiveness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) enmity that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) had against them.
<p/>They be here now, said the king, afore thee, now may ye say to them what ye will. CHAPTER XXIV. How King Arthur pardoned them, and demanded of them where Sir Gareth was.
<p/>THEN goodly they said all at once, God forgive you, and we do, and pray you that ye will tell us where we may find Sir Beaumains.
<p/>Fair lords, said Sir Ironside, I cannot tell you, for it is full hard to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>); for such young knights as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) is one, when they be in their adventures be never abiding in no place.
<p/>But to say the worship that the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) brother said of Beaumains, it was marvel to hear.
<p/>I shall do you honour for the love of Sir Beaumains, and as soon as ever I meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) I shall make you all upon one day knights of the Table Round.
<p/>And as to thee, Sir Persant of Inde, thou hast been ever called a full noble knight, and so have ever been thy three brethren called.
<p/>But I marvel, said the king, that I hear not of the Black Knight your brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was a full noble knight.
<p/>Sir, said Pertolepe, the Green Knight, Sir Beaumains slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in a recounter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) spear, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) name was Sir Percard.
<p/>Well, my fair lords, said King Arthur, wit you well That was great pity, said the king, and so said many knights.
<p/>For these four brethren were full well known in the court of King Arthur for noble knights, for long time they had holden war against the knights of the Round Table.
<p/>Then said Pertolepe, the Green Knight, to the king: At a passage of the water of Mortaise there encountered Sir Beaumains with two brethren that ever for the most part kept that passage, and they were two deadly knights, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) slew the eldest brother in the water, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) upon the head such a buffet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fell down in the water, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was drowned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) name was Sir Gherard le Breusse; and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) slew the other brother upon the land, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) name was Sir Arnold le Breusse.
<p/>CHAPTER XXV-LSB-*3-RSB- -LSB-*3-RSB- In Caxton's edition this chapter is misnumbered XXVI., setting the numeration wrong to the end of the book.
<p/>How the Queen of Orkney came to this feast of Pentecost, and Sir Gawaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) brethren came to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) blessing.
<p/>And as they sat at the meat, there came in the Queen of Orkney, with ladies and knights a great number.
<p/>And then Sir Gawaine, Sir Agravaine, and Gaheris arose, and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) and saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) upon their knees, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) blessing; for in fifteen year they had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>).
<p/>So then the king and they went to meat, and were served in the best manner. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spake on high to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) brother King Arthur:
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was here amongst you a twelvemonth, and ye made a kitchen knave of him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), the which is shame to you all.
<p/>Where have ye done my young son Sir Gareth? Alas, where have ye done my dear son that was my joy and bliss?
<p/>O dear mother, said Sir Gawaine, I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) not. Nor I, said the king, that now me repenteth, but thanked be God
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is proved a worshipful knight as any is now living of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) years, and I shall never be glad till I may find him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Ah, brother, said the Queen unto King Arthur, and unto Sir Gawaine, and to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sons, ye did yourself great shame when ye amongst you kept my son in the kitchen and fed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) like a poor hog.
<p/>wit I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) not, nor no more did Sir Gawaine, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) brethren; but sithen it is so, said the king, that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is thus gone from us all, we must shape a remedy to find him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>Also, sister, meseemeth ye might have done me to wit of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) coming, and then an I had not done well to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ye might have blamed me.
<p/>For when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came to this court he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came leaning upon two men's shoulders, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might not have gone.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) asked me three gifts; and one he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) asked the same day, that was that I would give him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) meat enough that twelvemonth; and the other two gifts he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) asked that day a twelvemonth, and
<p/>that was that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might have the adventure of the damosel Linet, and the third was that Sir Launcelot should make him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knight when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) desired him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>And so I granted him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) desire, and many in this court marvelled that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) desired his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sustenance for a twelvemonth.
<p/>Fair sister, said King Arthur, ye shall right well And thereby, we deemed, many of us, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was not come of a noble house.
<p/>Sir, said the Queen of Orkney unto King Arthur her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) brother, wit ye well that I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) unto you right well armed and horsed, and worshipfully beseen of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) body, and gold and silver plenty to spend.
<p/>It may be, said the King, but thereof saw we none, save that same day as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) departed from us, knights told me that there came a dwarf hither suddenly, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) armour and a good horse full well and richly beseen; and thereat we all had marvel from whence that riches came, that we deemed all that he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) was come of men of worship.
<p/>Brother, said the queen, all that ye say I believe, for ever sithen he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) was grown he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) was marvellously witted, and ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) was faithful and true of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) promise.
<p/>But I marvel, said she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), that Sir Kay did mock him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) and scorn him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) that name Beaumains; yet, Sir Kay, said the queen, named him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) more righteously than he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) weened; for I dare say an he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) be alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) is as fair an handed man and well disposed as any is living.
<p/>Sir, said Arthur, let this language be still, and by the grace of God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shall be found an he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) be within this seven realms, and let all this pass and be merry, for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is proved to be a man of worship, and that is my joy.
<p/>How King Arthur sent for the Lady Lionesse, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) let cry a tourney at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) castle, whereas came many knights.
<p/>THEN said Sir Gawaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) brethren unto Arthur, Sir, an ye will give us leave, we will go and seek our brother.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Launcelot, that shall ye not need; and so said Sir Baudwin of Britain: for as by our advice the king shall send unto Dame Lionesse a messenger, and pray her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) will come to the court in all the haste that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) may, and doubt ye not she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) will come; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) may give you best counsel where ye shall find him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>).
<p/>So then goodly letters were made, and the messenger sent forth, that night and day he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) went till he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) came unto the Castle Perilous.
<p/>CHAPTER XXVI. This is well said of you, said the king. And then the lady Dame Lionesse was sent for, thereas she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) was with Sir Gringamore her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) brother and Sir Gareth.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) understood this message, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) ride on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) way unto King Arthur, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) would come after in all goodly haste.
<p/>Then when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) came to Sir Gringamore and to Sir Gareth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) told them all how King Arthur had sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>).
<p/>That is because of me, said Sir Gareth. Now advise me, said Dame Lionesse, what shall I say, and in what manner I shall rule me.
<p/>My lady and my love, said Sir Gareth, I pray you in no wise be ye aknowen where I am; but well I wot
<p/>my mother is there and all my brethren, and they will take upon them to seek me, I wot well that they do.
<p/>Then may ye say, this is your advice that, an it like his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) good grace, ye will do make a cry against the feast of the Assumption of our Lady, that what knight there proveth him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) best he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall wield you and all your land.
<p/>And if so be that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be a wedded man, that his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wife shall have the degree, and a coronal of gold beset with stones of virtue to the value of a thousand pound, and a white gerfalcon.
<p/>So Dame Lionesse departed and came to King Arthur, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) was nobly received, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) was sore questioned of the king and of the Queen of Orkney.
<p/>But this, madam, I would ye said and advised the king when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) questioned with you of me. And she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) answered, where Sir Gareth was she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) could not tell.
<p/>Sir, I will let cry a tournament that shall be done before my castle at the Assumption of our Lady, and the cry shall be this: that you, my lord Arthur, shall be there, and your knights, and I will purvey that my knights shall be against yours; and then I am sure ye shall hear of Sir Gareth.
<p/>But thus much she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said unto Arthur: This is well advised, said King Arthur; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) departed. And the king and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) made great provision to that tournament.
<p/>When Dame Lionesse was come to the Isle of Avilion, that was the same isle thereas her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) brother Sir Gringamore dwelt
<p/>, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) told them all how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) had done, and what promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) had made to King Arthur. Alas, said Sir Gareth, I have been so wounded with unhappiness
<p/>sithen I came into this castle that I shall not be able to do at that tournament like a knight; for I was never thoroughly whole since I was hurt.
<p/>Be ye of good cheer, said the damosel Linet, for I undertake within these fifteen days to make ye whole, and as lusty as ever ye were.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) laid an ointment and a salve to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) as it pleased to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was never so fresh nor so lusty.
<p/>Then said the damosel Linet: Send you unto Sir Persant of Inde, and assummon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) knights to be here with you as they have promised.
<p/>Also, that ye send unto Sir Ironside, that is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and charge him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) be ready with you with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) whole sum of knights, and then shall ye be able to match with King Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knights.
<p/>So this was done, and all knights were sent for unto the Castle Perilous; and then the Red Knight answered and said unto Dame Lionesse, and to Sir Gareth, Madam, and my lord Sir Gareth, ye shall understand that I have been at the court of King Arthur, and Sir Persant of Inde and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) brethren, and there we have done our homage as ye commanded us.
<p/>Also Sir Ironside said, I have taken upon me with Sir Persant of Inde and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) brethren to hold part against my lord Sir Launcelot and the knights of that court.
<p/>And this have I done for the love of my lady Dame Lionesse, and you my lord Sir Gareth. Ye have well done, said Sir Gareth; but wit you well ye shall be full
<p/>sore matched with the most noble knights of the world; therefore we must purvey us of good knights, where we may get them.
<p/>And so the cry was made in England, Wales, and Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, and in all the Out Isles, and in Brittany and in many countries; that at the feast of our Lady the Assumption next coming, men should come to the Castle Perilous beside the Isle of Avilion; and there all the knights that there came should have the choice whether them list to be on the one party with the knights of the castle, or on the other party with King Arthur.
<p/>That is well said, said Sir Persant, and worshipfully. And two months was to the day that the tournament should be.
<p/>And so there came many good knights that were at their large, and held them for the most part against King Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights of the Round Table and came in the side of them of the castle.
<p/>For Sir Epinogrus was the first, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was the king's son of Northumberland, and Sir Palamides the Saracen was another, and Sir Safere his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) brother, and Sir Segwarides his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) brother, but they were christened, and Sir Malegrine another, and Sir Brian de les Isles, a noble knight, and Sir Grummore Grummursum, a good knight of Scotland, and Sir Carados of the dolorous tower, a noble knight, and Sir Turquine his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brother, and Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, two brethren, good knights of Cornwall.
<p/>There came Sir Tristram de Liones, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and Sir Sadok; but this Sir Tristram was not at that time knight of the Table Round, but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was one of the best knights of the world.
<p/>And so all these noble knights accompanied them with the lady of the castle, and with the Red Knight of the Red Launds; but as for Sir Gareth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) would not take upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) more but as other mean knights.
<p/>How King Arthur went to the tournament with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights, and how the lady received him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) worshipfully, and how the knights encountered.
<p/>And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nephews Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, and Sir Aglovale, Sir Tor, Sir Percivale de Galis, and Sir Lamorak de Galis.
<p/>Then came Sir Launcelot du Lake with his (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) brethren, nephews, and cousins, as Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir Galihodin, Sir Galihud, and many more of Sir Launcelot's blood, and Sir Dinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) brother, a good knight, and Sir Sagramore, a good knight; and all the most part of the Round Table.
<p/>Also there came with King Arthur these knights, the King of Ireland, King Agwisance, and the King of Scotland, King Carados and King Uriens of the land of Gore, and King Bagdemagus and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) son Sir Meliaganus, and Sir Galahault the noble prince.
<p/>All these kings, princes, and earls, barons, and other noble knights, as Sir Brandiles, Sir Uwaine les Avoutres, and Sir Kay, Sir Bedivere, Sir Meliot de Logres, Sir Petipase of Winchelsea, Sir Godelake
<p/>CHAPTER XXVII. AND then there came with King Arthur Sir Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) brethren. : all these came with King Arthur, and more that cannot be rehearsed.
<p/>Now leave we of these kings and knights, and let us speak of the great array that was made within the castle and about the castle for both parties.
<p/>The Lady Dame Lionesse ordained great array upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) part for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) noble knights, for all manner of lodging and victual that came by land and by water, that there lacked nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) party, nor for the other, but there was plenty to be had for gold and silver for King Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knights.
<p/>And then there came the harbingers from King Arthur for to harbour him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) kings, dukes, earls, barons, and knights.
<p/>And then Sir Gareth prayed Dame Lionesse and the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) brother, and Sir Gringamore, that in no wise there should none of them tell not his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) name, and make no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) than of the least knight that there was, For, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, I will not be known of neither more nor less, neither at the beginning neither at the ending.
<p/>Sir, I will lend you a ring, but I would pray you as you love me heartily let me have it again when the tournament is done, for that ring increaseth my beauty much more than it is of himself.
<p/>And the virtue of my ring is that, that is green it will turn to red, and that is red it will turn in likeness to green, and that is blue it will turn to likeness of white, and that is white it will turn in likeness to blue, and so it will do of all manner of colours.
<p/>Then Dame Lionesse said unto Sir Gareth: Also who that beareth my ring shall lose no blood, and for great love I will give you this ring.
<p/>Gramercy, said Sir Gareth, mine own lady, for this ring is passing meet for me, for it will turn all manner of likeness that I am in, and that shall cause me that I shall not be known.
<p/>Then Sir Gringamore gave Sir Gareth a bay courser that was a passing good horse; also he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) good armour and sure, and a noble sword that sometime Sir Gringamore's father won upon an heathen tyrant.
<p/>And so thus every knight made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ready to that tournament. And King Arthur was come two days to-fore the Assumption of our Lady.
<p/>And there was all manner of royalty of all minstrelsy that might be found. Also there came Queen Guenever and the Queen of Orkney, Sir Gareth's mother.
<p/>And upon the Assumption Day, when mass and matins were done, there were heralds with trumpets commanded to blow to the field.
<p/>And so there came out Sir Epinogrus, the king's son of Northumberland, from the castle, and there encountered with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and either of them brake their spears to their hands.
<p/>And then came in Sir Palamides out of the castle, and there encountered with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Gawaine, and either of them smote other so hard that both the good knights and their horses fell to the earth.
<p/>And then came in Sir Safere and Sir Segwarides, brethren to Sir Palamides; and there encountered Sir Agravaine with Sir Safere and Sir Gaheris encountered with Sir Segwarides.
<p/>And then knights of either party rescued their knights. So Sir Safere smote down Agravaine, Sir Gawaine's brother; and Sir Segwarides, Sir Safere's brother.
<p/>And Sir Malegrine, a knight of the castle, encountered with Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, and there Sir Uwaine gave Sir Malegrine a fall, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had almost broke his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) neck.
<p/>THEN Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummursum, knights of the castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale, and Sir Tor smote down Sir Grummore Grummursum to the earth.
<p/>Then came in Sir Carados of the dolorous tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle; and there encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Lamorak de Galis, that were two brethren.
<p/>And there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir Carados, and either brake their spears unto their hands, and then Sir Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote down other's horse and all to the earth, and either parties rescued other, and horsed them again.
<p/>And Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle, encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these four knights encountered mightily, and brake their spears to their hands.
<p/>Then came in Sir Tristram, Sir Sadok, and Sir Dinas, knights of the castle, and there encountered Sir Tristram with Sir Bedivere, and there Sir Bedivere was smitten to the earth both horse and man.
<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII. How the knights bare them in the battle. And Sir Sadok encountered with Sir Petipase, and there Sir Sadok was overthrown.
<p/>Then came in Sir Persant of Inde, a knight of the castle, and there encountered with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) Sir Launcelot du Lake, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) smote Sir Persant, horse and man, to the earth.
<p/>Then came Sir Pertolepe from the castle, and there encountered with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) Sir Lionel, and there Sir Pertolepe, the Green Knight, smote down Sir Lionel, brother to Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And there Uwaine les Avoutres smote down Sir Dinas, the Seneschal. All this was marked by noble heralds, who bare him (<font color='blue'><b>Lionel</b></font>) best, and their names.
<p/>And then came into the field Sir Perimones, the Red Knight, Sir Persant's brother, that was a knight of the castle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) encountered with Sir Ector de Maris, and either smote other so hard that both their horses and they fell to the earth.
<p/>And then came in the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and Sir Gareth, from the castle, and there encountered with them Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Bleoberis, and there the Red Knight and Sir Bors -LSB-either-RSB- smote other so hard that their spears brast, and their horses fell grovelling to the earth.
<p/>Then Sir Bleoberis brake his (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) spear upon Sir Gareth, but of that stroke Sir Bleoberis fell to the earth. When Sir Galihodin saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) bade Sir Gareth keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and Sir Gareth smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) to the earth.
<p/>Then Sir Galihud gat a spear to avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) brother, and in the same wise Sir Gareth served him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and Sir Dinadan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) brother, La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and Sir Dodinas le Savage.
<p/>All these he (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) bare down with one spear. When King Agwisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth fare so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) marvelled what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) might be that one time seemed green, and
<p/>another time, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) again coming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) seemed blue. And thus at every course that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) rode to and fro he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) colour, so that there might neither king nor knight have ready cognisance of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Then Sir Agwisance, the King of Ireland, encountered with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) horse, saddle and all.
<p/>And then came King Carados of Scotland, and Sir Gareth smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) down horse and man. And in the same wise he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) served King Uriens of the land of Gore.
<p/>And then came in Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Gareth smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) down, horse and man, to the earth. And Bagdemagus' son, Meliganus, brake a spear upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly.
<p/>And then Sir Galahault, the noble prince, cried on high: Knight with the many colours, well hast thou jousted; now make thee ready that I may joust with thee.
<p/>Sir Gareth heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) gat a great spear, and so they encountered together, and there the prince brake his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) spear; but Sir Gareth smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) upon the left side of the helm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) reeled here and there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had fallen down had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) men recovered him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>So God me help, said King Arthur, that same knight with the many colours is a good knight. Wherefore the king called unto him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Sir Launcelot, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to encounter with that knight.
<p/>Sir, said Launcelot, I may well find in my heart for to forbear him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) as at this time, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath had travail enough this day; and when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is no good knight's part to let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) worship, and namely, when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) seeth a knight hath done so great labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is best beloved with this lady of all that be here
<p/>; for I see well he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) paineth him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and enforceth him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to do great deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me, this day he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall have the honour; though it lay in my power to put him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) from it
<p/>I would not. CHAPTER XXIX. Yet of the said tournament. THEN when this was done there was drawing of swords, and then there began a sore tournament.
<p/>, that was the Red Knight of the Red Launds, there was strong battle; and betwixt Sir Palamides and Bleoberis there was a strong battle; and Sir Gawaine and Sir Tristram met, and there Sir Gawaine had the worse, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) pulled Sir Gawaine from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) horse, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was long upon foot, and defouled.
<p/>Then came in Sir Launcelot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) smote Sir Turquine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); and then came Sir Carados his (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) brother, and both at once they assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) as the most noblest knight of the world worshipfully fought with them both, that all men wondered of the noblesse of Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And there did Sir Lamorak marvellous deeds of arms; and betwixt Sir Lamorak and Sir Ironside And then came in Sir Gareth, and knew that it was Sir Launcelot that fought with the two perilous knights.
<p/>And then Sir Gareth came with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) good horse and hurtled them in-sunder, and no stroke would he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) smite to Sir Launcelot.
<p/>That espied Sir Launcelot, and deemed it should be the good knight Sir Gareth: and then Sir Gareth rode here and there, and smote on the right hand and on the left hand, and all the folk might well espy where that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) rode.
<p/>And by fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) met with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) brother Sir Gawaine, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) put Sir Gawaine to the worse, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) helm, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) served five or six knights of the Round Table, that all men said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) in the most pain, and best he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) devoir.
<p/>For when Sir Tristram beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) first jousted and after fought so well with a sword, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode unto Sir Ironside and to Sir Persant of Inde, and asked them, by their faith, What manner a knight is yonder knight that seemeth in so many divers colours?
<p/>Truly, meseemeth, said Tristram, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) putteth himself in great pain, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) never ceaseth. Wot ye not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is? said Sir Ironside.
<p/>Then shall ye know that this is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) that loveth the lady of the castle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) again; and this is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) that won me when I besieged the lady of this castle, and this is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) that won Sir Persant of Inde, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) three brethren.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) was called in the court of King Arthur, Beaumains, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) right name is Sir Gareth of Orkney, brother to Sir Gawaine.
<p/>By my head, said Sir Tristram, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is a good knight, and a big man of arms, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) be young he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shall prove a full noble knight.
<p/>No, said Sir Tristram. What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name, said Sir Tristram, and of what blood is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) come? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is but a child, they all said, and of Sir Launcelot he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was made knight.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram, Sir Ironside, Sir Persant, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) brother, rode together for to help Sir Gareth; and then there were given many strong strokes.
<p/>Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) is mickle the better, said Tristram. And then Sir Gareth rode out on the one side to amend his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) helm; and then said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) dwarf:
<p/>And so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had drunk he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) gat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) helm, and eagerly took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) horse and rode into the field, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) ring with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) dwarf; and the dwarf was glad the ring was from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>)
<p/>Take me your ring, that ye lose it not while that ye drink. , for then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) wist well he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) should be known.
<p/>And then when Sir Gareth was in the field all folks saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) well and plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was in yellow colours; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) rased off helms and pulled down knights, that King Arthur had marvel what knight he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was, for the king saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hair that it was the same knight.
<p/>CHAPTER XXX. How Sir Gareth was espied by the heralds, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) escaped out of the field. BUT before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was in so many colours, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) is but in one colour; that is yellow.
<p/>Now go, said King Arthur unto divers heralds, and ride about him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and espy what manner knight he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is, for I have spered of many knights this day that be upon his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) party, and all say they know him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) not.
<p/>And so an herald rode nigh Gareth as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) could; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) saw written about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) helm in gold, This helm is Sir Gareth of Orkney.
<p/>Then the herald cried as he (<font color='blue'><b>Orkney</b></font>) were wood, and many heralds with him (<font color='blue'><b>Orkney</b></font>):--This is Sir Gareth of Orkney in the yellow arms; wherby-LSB-*4-RSB- all kings and knights of Arthur's beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and awaited; and then they pressed all to behold him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and ever the heralds cried: This is Sir Gareth of Orkney, King Lot's son.
<p/>And when Sir Gareth espied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was discovered, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) strokes, and smote down Sir Sagramore, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) brother Sir Gawaine.
<p/>O brother, said Sir Gawaine, I weened ye would not have stricken me. -LSB-*4-RSB- So W. de Worde; Caxton <div class="bookquote">``that by.
<p/>So when he (<font color='blue'><b>Worde</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Worde</b></font>) say so he (<font color='blue'><b>Worde</b></font>) thrang here and there, and so with great pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Worde</b></font>) gat out of the press, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Worde</b></font>) met with his (<font color='blue'><b>Worde</b></font>) dwarf.
<p/>O boy, said Sir Gareth, thou hast beguiled me foul this day that thou kept my ring; give it me anon again, that I may hide my body withal; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) took it him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>And then they all wist not where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was become; and Sir Gawaine had in manner espied where Sir Gareth rode, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) rode after with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) might.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Caxton/WILLIAM CAXTON/William Caxton</b></font>)</div>That espied Sir Gareth, and rode lightly into the forest, that Sir Gawaine wist not where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was become. And when Sir Gareth wist that Sir Gawaine was passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) asked the dwarf of best counsel.
<p/>Sir, said the dwarf, meseemeth it were best, now that ye are escaped from spying, that ye send my lady Dame Lionesse her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) ring.
<p/>It is well advised, said Sir Gareth; now have it here and bear it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>), and say that I recommend me unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) good grace, and say her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) I will come when I may, and I pray her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) to be true and faithful to me as I will be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>).
<p/>Sir, said the dwarf, it shall be done as ye command: and so he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) rode his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) way, and did his (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) errand unto the lady.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, Where is my knight, Sir Gareth? Madam, said the dwarf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) bade me say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) would not be long from you.
<p/>And so lightly the dwarf came again unto Sir Gareth, that would full fain have had a lodging, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had need to be reposed.
<p/>And Sir Gareth was not a little weary, for of all that day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had but little rest, neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) horse nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>And then fell there a thunder and a rain, as heaven and earth should go together. So this Sir Gareth rode so long in that forest until the night came.
<p/>And ever it lightened and thundered, as it had been wood. At the last by fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) came to a castle, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) heard the waits upon the walls.
<p/>How Sir Gareth came to a castle where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was well lodged, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) jousted with a knight and slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>THEN Sir Gareth rode unto the barbican of the castle, and prayed the porter fair to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) into the castle.
<p/>Fair sir, say not so, for I am a knight of King Arthur's, and pray the lord or the lady of this castle to give me harbour for the love of King Arthur.
<p/>Then the porter went unto the duchess, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) how there was a knight of King Arthur's would have harbour.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in, said the duchess, for I will see that knight, and for King Arthur's sake he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shall not be harbourless.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXI. The porter answered ungoodly again, and said, Thou gettest no lodging here. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) yode up into a tower over the gate, with great torchlight.
<p/>When Sir Gareth saw that torch-light he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) cried on high: Whether thou be lord or lady, giant or champion, I take no force so that I may have harbour this night; and if it so be that I must needs fight, spare me not to-morn when I have rested me, for both I and mine horse be weary.
<p/>Sir knight, said the lady, thou speakest knightly and boldly; but wit thou well the lord of this castle loveth not King Arthur, nor none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) court, for my lord hath ever been against him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>); and therefore thou were better not to come within this castle; for an thou come in this night, thou must come in under such form, that wheresomever thou meet my lord, by stigh or by street, thou must yield thee to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) as prisoner.
<p/>Madam, said Sir Gareth, what is your lord, and what is his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) name? Sir, my lord's name is the Duke de la Rowse.
<p/>Well madam, said Sir Gareth, I shall promise you in what place I meet your lord I shall yield me unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) good grace;
<p/>with that I understand he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) will do me no harm: and if I understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) will, I will release myself an
<p/>Ye say well, said the duchess; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) let the drawbridge down, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) rode into the hall, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) alighted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) horse was led into a stable; and in the hall he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) unarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) and said, Madam, I will not out of this hall this night; and when it is daylight, let see who will have ado with me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) shall find me ready.
<p/>I can with my spear and my sword. Then was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) set unto supper, and had many good dishes. Then Sir Gareth list well to eat, and knightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) meat, and eagerly
<p/>; there was many a fair lady by him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and some said they never saw a goodlier man nor so well of eating.
<p/>Then they made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passing good cheer, and shortly when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had supped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed was made there; so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rested him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all night.
<p/>And on the morn he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard mass, and brake his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fast and took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leave at the duchess, and at them all; and thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) goodly of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) lodging, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good cheer; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name.
<p/>Madam, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, truly my name is Gareth of Orkney, and some men call me Beaumains. Then knew she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) well it was the same knight that fought for Dame Lionesse.
<p/>So Sir Gareth departed and rode up into a mountain, and there met him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) a knight, his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name was Sir Bendelaine, and said to Sir Gareth:
<p/>Thou shalt not pass this way, for either thou shalt joust with me, or else be my prisoner. Then will I joust, said Sir Gareth.
<p/>And so they let their horses run, and there Sir Gareth smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) throughout the body; and Sir Bendelaine rode forth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) castle there beside, and there died.
<p/>So Sir Gareth would have rested him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) came riding to Bendelaine's castle. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) knights and servants espied that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) that had slain their lord.
<p/>Then they armed twenty good men, and came out and assailed Sir Gareth; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had no spear, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) sword, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) shield afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>); and there they brake their spears upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and they assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) passingly sore.
<p/>But ever Sir Gareth defended him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) as a knight. CHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Gareth fought with a knight that held within his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) castle thirty ladies, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>SO when they saw that they might not overcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), they rode from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and took their counsel to slay his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) horse; and so they came in upon Sir Gareth, and with spears they slew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) horse, and then they assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) hard.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was on foot, there was none that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) fought but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) such a buffet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) did never recover.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) slew them by one and one till they were but four, and there they fled; and Sir Gareth took a good horse that was one of theirs, and rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) way.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) rode a great pace till that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) came to a castle, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) heard much mourning of ladies and gentlewomen.
<p/>Sir knight, said the page, here be within this castle thirty ladies, and all they be widows; for here is a knight that waiteth daily upon this castle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name is the Brown Knight without Pity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is the periloust knight that now liveth; and therefore sir, said the page, I rede you flee.
<p/>So there came by him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) a page. What noise is this, said Sir Gareth, that I hear within this castle? Nay, said Sir Gareth, I will not flee though thou be afeard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>And then the page saw where came the Brown Knight: Lo, said the page, yonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) cometh. Let me deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), said Sir Gareth.
<p/>And when either of other had a sight they let their horses run, and the Brown Knight brake his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) spear, and Sir Gareth smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) throughout the body, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) overthrew him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) to the ground stark dead.
<p/>So Sir Gareth rode into the castle, and prayed the ladies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) might repose him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>). Alas, said the ladies, ye may not be lodged here.
<p/>Make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) good cheer, said the page, for this knight hath slain your enemy. Then they all made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) good cheer as lay in their power.
<p/>And so on the morn he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went to mass, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw the thirty ladies kneel, and lay grovelling upon divers tombs, making great dole and sorrow.
<p/>But wit ye well they made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) good cheer, for they might none otherwise do, for they were but poor. Then Sir Gareth wist well that in the tombs lay their lords.
<p/>Fair ladies, said Sir Gareth, ye must at the next feast of Pentecost be at the court of King Arthur, and say that I, Sir Gareth, sent you thither.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) departed, and by fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) came to a mountain, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) found a goodly knight that bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), Abide sir knight, and joust with me.
<p/>We shall do this, said the ladies. What are ye? said Sir Gareth. My name is, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), the Duke de la Rowse.
<p/>Ah sir, ye are the same knight that I lodged once in your castle; and there I made promise unto your lady that I should yield me unto you.
<p/>Ah, said the duke, art thou that proud knight that profferest to fight with my knights; therefore make thee ready, for I will have ado with you.
<p/>But the duke lightly avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse, and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword, and bade Sir Gareth alight and fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>So they let their horses run, and there Sir Gareth smote the duke down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) horse. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) did alight, and they did great battle together more than an hour, and either hurt other full sore.
<p/>At the last Sir Gareth gat the duke to the earth, and would have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>Then must ye go, said Sir Gareth, unto Sir Arthur my lord at the next feast, and say that I, Sir Gareth of Orkney, sent you unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>).
<p/>It shall be done, said the duke, and I will do to you homage and fealty with an hundred knights with me; and all the days of my life to do you service where ye will command me.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Gareth and Sir Gawaine fought each against other, and how they knew each other by the damosel Linet.
<p/>Then Sir Gareth took the duke's shield, and mounted upon horseback, and so without biding they ran together as it had been the thunder.
<p/>SO the duke departed, and Sir Gareth stood there alone; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) saw an armed knight coming toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>). And there that knight hurt Sir Gareth under the side with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) spear.
<p/>And then they alighted and drew their swords, and gave great strokes that the blood trailed to the ground. And so they fought two hours.
<p/>At the last there came the damosel Linet, that some men called the damosel Savage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) came riding upon an ambling mule; and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) cried all on high, Sir Gawaine, Sir Gawaine, leave thy fighting with thy brother Sir Gareth.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) say so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) threw away his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) shield and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) sword, and ran to Sir Gareth, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) arms, and sithen kneeled down and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) mercy.
<p/>What are ye, said Sir Gareth, that right now were so strong and so mighty, and now so suddenly yield you to me?
<p/>O Gareth, I am your brother Sir Gawaine, that for your sake have had great sorrow and labour. Then Sir Gareth unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) helm, and kneeled down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) mercy.
<p/>Then they rose both, and embraced either other in their arms, and wept a great while or they might speak, and either of them gave other the prize of the battle.
<p/>And there were many kind words between them. Alas, my fair brother, said Sir Gawaine, perdy I owe of right to worship you
<p/>an ye were not my brother, for ye have worshipped King Arthur and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) court, for ye have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)-LSB-*5-RSB-
<p/>more worshipful knights this twelvemonth than six the best of the Round Table have done, except Sir Launcelot. -LSB-*5-RSB- So W. de Worde; Caxton <div class="bookquote">``me.
<p/>Then came the damosel Savage that was the Lady Linet, that rode with Sir Gareth so long, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) did staunch Sir Gareth's wounds and Sir Gawaine's.
<p/>meseemeth that it were well done that Arthur had witting of you both, for your horses are so bruised that they may not bear.
<p/>Now, fair damosel, said Sir Gawaine, I pray you ride unto my lord mine uncle, King Arthur, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) what adventure is to me betid here, and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) will not tarry long.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Caxton/WILLIAM CAXTON/William Caxton</b></font>)</div>Now what will ye do? said the damosel Savage; Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mule, and lightly she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) came to King Arthur that was but two mile thence.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) back he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bade the lords and ladies come after, who that would; and there was saddling and bridling of queens' horses and princes' horses, and well was him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) that soonest might be ready.
<p/>So when the king came thereas they were, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) saw Sir Gawaine and Sir Gareth sit upon a little hill-side, and then the king avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came nigh Sir Gareth he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) would have spoken but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) might not; and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) sank down in a swoon for gladness.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) tidings the king bade get him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) a palfrey. And so they stert unto their uncle, and required him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) good grace to be of good comfort.
<p/>Wit ye well the king made great joy, and many a piteous complaint he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) made to Sir Gareth, and ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) wept as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had been a child.
<p/>With that came his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) mother, the Queen of Orkney, Dame Morgawse, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw Sir Gareth readily in the visage she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might not weep, but suddenly fell down in a swoon, and lay there a great while like as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been dead.
<p/>Then the king commanded that all manner of knights that were under his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) obeissance should make their lodging right there for the love of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) nephews.
<p/>And so it was done, and all manner of purveyance purveyed, that there lacked nothing that might be gotten of tame nor wild for gold or silver.
<p/>And then by the means of the damosel Savage Sir Gawaine and Sir Gareth were healed of their wounds; and there they sojourned eight days.
<p/>And then Sir Gareth recomforted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) mother in such wise that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) recovered and made good cheer. Then said King Arthur unto the damosel Savage:
<p/>I marvel that your sister, Dame Lionesse, cometh not here to me, and in especial that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) cometh not to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) knight, my nephew Sir Gareth, that hath had so much travail for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) love.
<p/>My lord, said the damosel Linet, ye must of your good grace hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) excused, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) knoweth not that my lord, Sir Gareth, is here.
<p/>Go then for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>), said King Arthur, that we may be appointed what is best to be done, according to the pleasure of my nephew.
<p/>And as lightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) might she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) ready; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) came on the morn with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) brother Sir Gringamore, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) forty knights.
<p/>And so when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) was come she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) had all the cheer that might be done, both of the king, and of many other kings and queens.
<p/>Sir, said the damosel, that shall be done, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) rode unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) sister. CHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Gareth acknowledged that they loved each other to King Arthur, and of the appointment of their wedding.
<p/>Then when Sir Gawaine saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) there was many a goodly look and goodly words, that all men of worship had joy to behold them.
<p/>AND among all these ladies she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) was named the fairest, and peerless. Then came King Arthur and many other kings, and Dame Guenever, and the Queen of Orkney.
<p/>And there the king asked his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) nephew, Sir Gareth, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) would have that lady as paramour, or to have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) wife.
<p/>My lord, wit you well that I love her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) above all ladies living. Now, fair lady, said King Arthur, what say ye?
<p/>Most noble King, said Dame Lionesse, wit you well that my lord, Sir Gareth, is to me more liefer to have and wield as my husband, than any king or prince that is christened; and
<p/>if I may not have him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) I promise you I will never have none. For, my lord Arthur, said Dame Lionesse, wit
<p/>well he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is my first love, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) shall be the last; and if ye will suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) will and free choice
<p/>ye I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) will have me. That is truth, said Sir Gareth; an I have not you and wield not you as my wife, there shall never lady nor gentlewoman rejoice me.
<p/>well I would not for the stint of my crown to be causer to withdraw your hearts; and wit ye well
<p/>What, nephew, said the king, is the wind in that door? for wit ye ye cannot love so well but I shall rather increase it than distress it.
<p/>And also ye shall have my love and my lordship in the uttermost wise that may lie in my power. And in the same wise said Sir Gareth's mother.
<p/>Then there was made a provision for the day of marriage; and by the king's advice it was provided that it should be at Michaelmas following, at Kink Kenadon by the seaside, for there is a plentiful country.
<p/>And then Sir Gareth sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) summons to all these knights and ladies that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) had won in battle to-fore, that they should be at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) day of marriage at Kink Kenadon by the sands.
<p/>And then Dame Lionesse, and the damosel Linet with Sir Gringamore, rode to their castle; and a goodly and a rich ring she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) gave to Sir Gareth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) another.
<p/>And King Arthur gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) a rich pair of beads-LSB-*6-RSB- of gold; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) departed; and King Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fellowship rode toward Kink Kenadon, and Sir Gareth brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) lady on the way, and so came to the king again and rode with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>the great cheer that Sir Launcelot made of Sir Gareth and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), for there was never no knight that Sir Gareth loved so well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) did Sir Launcelot; and ever for the most part he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) would be in Sir Launcelot's company; for after Sir Gareth had espied Sir Gawaine's conditions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) withdrew himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) brother, Sir Gawaine's, fellowship, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) was vengeable, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) hated he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) would be avenged with murder, and that hated Sir Gareth.
<p/>And so it was cried in all the places through the realm. Lord! -LSB-*6-RSB- So W. de Worde; Caxton <div class="bookquote">``bee. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Caxton/WILLIAM CAXTON/William Caxton</b></font>)</div><p/>Of the Great Royalty, and what officers were made at the feast of the wedding, and of the jousts at the feast.
<p/>SO it drew fast to Michaelmas; and thither came Dame Lionesse, the lady of the Castle Perilous, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) sister, Dame Linet, with Sir Gringamore, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) brother, with them for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had the conduct of these ladies.
<p/>And upon Michaelmas Day the Bishop of Canterbury made the wedding betwixt Sir Gareth and the Lady Lionesse with great solemnity.
<p/>And King Arthur made Gaheris to wed the Damosel Savage, that was Dame Linet; and King Arthur made Sir Agravaine to we
<p/>CHAPTER XXXV. And there they were lodged at the device of King Arthur. d Dame Lionesse's niece, a fair lady, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name was Dame Laurel.
<p/>And so when this solemnization was done, then came in the Green Knight, Sir Pertolepe, with thirty knights, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) did homage and fealty to Sir Gareth, and these knights to hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) for evermore.
<p/>Also Sir Pertolepe said: I pray you that at this feast I may be your chamberlain. With a good will, said Sir Gareth sith it liketh you to take so simple an office.
<p/>Then came in the Red Knight, with three score knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), and did to Sir Gareth homage and fealty, and all those knights to hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) for evermore.
<p/>And then this Sir Perimones prayed Sir Gareth to grant him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) chief butler at that high feast. I will well, said Sir Gareth, that ye have this office, and it were better.
<p/>Then came in Sir Persant of Inde, with an hundred knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) did homage and fealty, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) knights should do him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) service, and hold their lands of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) for ever; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) prayed Sir Gareth to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) sewer-chief at the feast.
<p/>Then came the Duke de la Rowse with an hundred knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) did homage and fealty to Sir Gareth, and so to hold their lands of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) for ever.
<p/>I will well, said Sir Gareth, that ye have it and it were better. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) required Sir Gareth that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) might serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) of the wine that day of that feast.
<p/>Then came in the Red Knight of the Red Launds, that was Sir Ironside, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) three hundred knights, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) did homage and fealty, and all these knights to hold their lands of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ironside</b></font>) for ever.
<p/>I will well, said Sir Gareth, and it were better. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) asked Sir Gareth to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) carver. I will well, said Sir Gareth, an it please you.
<p/>Then came into the court thirty ladies, and all they seemed widows, and those thirty ladies brought with them many fair gentlewomen.
<p/>And all they kneeled down at once unto King Arthur and unto Sir Gareth, and there all those ladies told the king how Sir Gareth delivered them from the dolorous tower, and slew the Brown Knight without Pity: And therefore we, and our heirs for evermore, will do homage unto Sir Gareth of Orkney.
<p/>So then the kings and queens, princes and earls, barons and many bold knights, went unto meat; and well may ye wit there were all manner of meat plenteously, all manner revels and games, with all manner of minstrelsy that was used in those days.
<p/>But the king would not suffer Sir Gareth to joust, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gareth</b></font>) new bride; for, as the French book saith, that Dame Lionesse desired of the king that none that were wedded should joust at that feast.
<p/>So the first day there jousted Sir Lamorak de Galis, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) overthrew thirty knights, and did passing marvellously deeds of arms; and then King Arthur made Sir Persant and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) two brethren Knights of the Round Table to their lives' end, and gave them great lands.
<p/>Also there was great jousts three days. Also the second day there jousted Tristram best, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) overthrew forty knights, and did there marvellous deeds of arms.
<p/>, that was the Red Knight of the Red Launds, a Knight of the Table Round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) life's end, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) great lands.
<p/>The third day there jousted Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) overthrew fifty knights, and did many marvellous deeds of arms, that all men wondered on him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>).
<p/>And there King Arthur made the Duke de la Rowse a Knight of the Round Table to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) life's end, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) great lands to spend.
<p/>But when these jousts were done, Sir Lamorak and Sir Tristram departed suddenly, and would not be known, for the which King Arthur and all the court were sore displeased.
<p/>And there King Arthur made Ironside And so they held the court forty days with great solemnity. And this Sir Gareth was a noble knight, and a well-ruled, and fair-languaged.
<p/>Thus endeth this tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that wedded Dame Lionesse of the Castle Perilous. And also Sir Gaheris wedded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lionesse</b></font>) sister, Dame Linet, that was called the Damosel Sabage.
<p/>And Sir Agrabaine wedded Dame Laurel, a fair lady and great, and mighty lands with great riches gave with them King Arthur, that royally they might live till their lives' end.
<p/>book, the which is the first book of Sir Tristram de Liones, and who was his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mother, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was born and fostered, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was made knight.
<p/>Here followeth the viii. BOOK VIII CHAPTER I. How Sir Tristram de Liones was born, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) mother died at his (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) birth, wherefore she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) named him (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) Tristram.
<p/>IT was a king that hight Meliodas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was lord and king of the country of Liones, and this Meliodas was a likely knight as any was that time living.
<p/>And by fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wedded King Mark's sister of Cornwall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was called Elizabeth, that was called both good and fair.
<p/>And at that time King Arthur reigned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was whole king of England, Wales, and Scotland, and of many other realms: howbeit there were many kings that were lords of many countries, but all they held their lands of King Arthur; for in Wales were two kings, and in the north were many kings; and in Cornwall and in the west were two kings; also in Ireland were two or three kings, and all were under the obeissance of King Arthur.
<p/>So when this King Meliodas had been with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wife, within a while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) waxed great with child, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a full meek lady, and well she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lord, and
<p/>So was the King of France, and the King of Brittany, and all the lordships unto Rome. he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again, so there was great joy
<p/>Then there was a lady in that country that had loved King Meliodas long, and by no mean she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never could get his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) love; therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) let ordain upon a day, as King Meliodas rode a-hunting, for he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was a great chaser, and there by an enchantment she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) chase an hart by himself alone till that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came to an old castle, and there anon he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was taken prisoner by the lady that him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) loved.
<p/>When Elizabeth, King Meliodas' wife, missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lord, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was nigh out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wit, and also as great with child as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) took a gentlewoman with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and ran into the forest to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lord.
<p/>betwixt them. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was far in the forest she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might no farther, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began to travail fast of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) child.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had many grimly throes; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) gentlewoman helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might, and so by miracle of Our Lady of Heaven
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was delivered with great pains. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had taken such cold for the default of help that deep draughts of death took her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), that needs
<p/>And when this Queen Elizabeth saw that there was none other bote, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) made great dole, and said unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) gentlewoman: When ye see my lord, King Meliodas, recommend me unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) what pains I endure here for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) love, and how I must die here for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sake for default of good help; and let him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wit that I am full sorry to depart out of this world from him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), therefore pray him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to be friend to my soul.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must die and depart out of this world; there was none other bote. Now let me see my little child, for whom I have had all this sorrow.
<p/>Ah, my little son, thou hast murdered thy mother, and therefore I suppose, thou that art a murderer so young, thou art full likely to be a manly man in thine age.
<p/>And because I shall die of the birth of thee, I charge thee, gentlewoman, that thou pray my lord, King Meliodas, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Meliodas</b></font>) is christened let call him (<font color='blue'><b>Meliodas</b></font>) Tristram, that is as much to say as a sorrowful birth.
<p/>Then the gentlewoman laid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) under an umbre of a great tree, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lapped the child as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might for cold.
<p/>so there came the barons, following after the queen, and when they saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was dead, and understood none other but the king was destroyed, -LSB-*7-RSB-then certain of them would have slain the child, because they would have been lords of the country of Liones.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) said thus: And therewith this queen gave up the ghost and died. Right -LSB-*7-RSB- Printed by Caxton as part of chap.
<p/>BUT then through the fair speech of the gentlewoman, and by the means that she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) made, the most part of the barons would not assent thereto.
<p/>ii. CHAPTER II. How the stepmother of Sir Tristram had ordained poison for to have poisoned Sir Tristram. And then they let carry home the dead queen, and much dole was made for her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>).
<p/>Then this meanwhile Merlin delivered King Meliodas out of prison on the morn after his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) queen was dead. And so when the king was come home the most part of the barons made great joy.
<p/>So then the king let inter her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) richly, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) let christen his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) child as his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wife had commanded afore her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death.
<p/>But the sorrow that the king made for his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) queen that might no tongue tell. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) let call him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Tristram, the sorrowful born child.
<p/>Then the King Meliodas endured seven years without a wife, and all this time Tristram was nourished well. Then it befell that King Meliodas wedded King Howell's daughter of Brittany, and anon
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had children of King Meliodas: then was she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heavy and wroth that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) children should not rejoice the country of Liones, wherefore this queen ordained for to poison young Tristram.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) let poison be put in a piece of silver in the chamber whereas Tristram and her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) children were together, unto that intent that when Tristram were thirsty he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should drink that drink.
<p/>And so it fell upon a day, the queen's son, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was in that chamber, espied the piece with poison, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) weened it had been good drink, and because the child was thirsty he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) took the piece with poison and drank freely; and therewithal suddenly the child brast and was dead.
<p/>When the queen of Meliodas wist of the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) son, wit ye well that she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was heavy. But yet the king understood nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) treason.
<p/>And by fortune King Meliodas, her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) husband, found the piece with wine where was the poison, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) that was much thirsty took the piece for to drink thereout.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would have drunken thereof the queen espied him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) ran unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and pulled the piece from him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) suddenly.
<p/>Notwithstanding the queen would not leave this, but eft she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) let ordain more poison, and put it in a piece. The king marvelled why she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) did so, and remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) how her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) son was suddenly slain with poison.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) by the hand, and said: Thou false traitress, thou shalt tell me what manner of drink this is, or else I shall slay thee.
<p/>And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sword, and sware a great oath that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should slay her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) but if she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) truth.
<p/>Ah! mercy, my lord, said she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), and I shall tell you all. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) would have slain Tristram, because her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) children should rejoice his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) land.
<p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was condemned by the assent of the barons to be burnt; and then was there made a great fire, and right as she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was at the fire to take her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) execution, young Tristram kneeled afore King Meliodas, and besought him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a boon.
<p/>Well, said King Meliodas, and therefore shall ye have the law. I will well, said the king again. Then said young Tristram, Give me the life of thy queen, my stepmother.
<p/>That is unrightfully asked, said King Meliodas, for thou ought of right to hate her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) would have slain thee with that poison
<p/>Sir, said Tristram, as for that, I beseech you of your mercy that you will forgive it her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), and as for my part, God forgive it her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), and I do; and so much it liked your highness to grant me my boon, for God's love
<p/>an she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) might have had her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) will; and for thy sake most is my cause that she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) should die. I require you hold your promise.
<p/>Then, said the king, I give her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) to you, and go ye to the fire and take her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), and do with her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) what ye will.
<p/>Sithen it is so, said the king, I will that ye have her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) life. So Sir Tristram went to the fire, and by the commandment of the king delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) from the death.
<p/>But after that King Meliodas would never have ado with her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), as at bed and board. But by the good means of young Tristram he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) made the king and her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) accorded.
<p/>How Sir Tristram was sent into France, and had one to govern him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) named Gouvernail, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) learned to harp, hawk, and hunt.
<p/>AND then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) let ordain a gentleman that was well learned and taught, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name was Gouvernail; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sent young Tristram with Gouvernail into France to learn the language, and nurture, and deeds of arms.
<p/>But then the king would not suffer young Tristram to abide no longer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) court. CHAPTER III. And there was Tristram more than seven years.
<p/>And then when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well could speak the language, and had learned all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might learn in that country, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) father, King Meliodas, again.
<p/>And so Tristram learned to be an harper passing all other, that there was none such called in no country, and so on harping and on instruments of music he (<font color='blue'><b>harper</b></font>) applied him (<font color='blue'><b>harper</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>harper</b></font>) youth for to learn.
<p/>And after, as he (<font color='blue'><b>harper</b></font>) grew in might and strength, he (<font color='blue'><b>harper</b></font>) laboured ever in hunting and in hawking, so that never gentleman more, that ever we heard read of.
<p/>And as the book saith, he (<font color='blue'><b>harper</b></font>) began good measures of blowing of beasts of venery, and beasts of chase, and all manner of vermin, and all these terms we have yet of hawking and hunting.
<p/>Wherefore, as meseemeth, all gentlemen that bear old arms ought of right to honour Sir Tristram for the goodly terms that gentlemen have and use, and shall to the day of doom, that thereby in a manner all men of worship may dissever a gentleman from a yeoman, and from a yeoman a villain.
<p/>And therefore the book of venery, of hawking, and hunting, is called the book of Sir Tristram. For he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) that gentle is will draw him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) unto gentle tatches, and to follow the customs of noble gentlemen.
<p/>Thus Sir Tristram endured in Cornwall until he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was big and strong, of the age of eighteen years. And then the King Meliodas had great joy of Sir Tristram, and so had the queen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wife.
<p/>For ever after in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life, because Sir Tristram saved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from the fire, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did never hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) more after, but loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ever after, and gave Tristram many great gifts; for every estate loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), where that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) went.
<p/>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Marhaus came out of Ireland for to ask truage of Cornwall, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would fight therefore.
<p/>THEN it befell that King Anguish of Ireland sent unto King Mark of Cornwall for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) truage, that Cornwall had paid many winters.
<p/>And King Mark and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) barons gave unto the messenger of Ireland these words and answer, that they would none pay; and bade the messenger go unto his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) King Anguish, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) we will pay him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) no truage, but tell your lord, an he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will always have truage of us of Cornwall, bid him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) send a trusty knight of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) land, that will fight for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) right, and we shall find another for to defend our right.
<p/>And all that time King Mark was behind of the truage for seven years. With this answer the messengers departed into Ireland.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) called unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) Sir Marhaus, the good knight, that was nobly proved, and a Knight of the Table Round.
<p/>And when King Anguish understood the answer of the messengers he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was wonderly wroth. And this Marhaus was brother unto the queen of Ireland.
<p/>Then the king said thus: Fair brother, Sir Marhaus, I pray you go into Cornwall for my sake, and do battle for our truage that of right we ought to have; and whatsomever ye spend ye shall have sufficiently, more than ye shall need.
<p/>Sir, said Marhaus, wit ye well that I shall not be loath to do battle in the right of you and your land with the best knight of the Table Round;
<p/>for I know them, for the most part, what be their deeds; and for to advance my deeds and to increase my worship I will right gladly go unto this journey for our right.
<p/>So in all haste there was made purveyance for Sir Marhaus, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had all things that to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) needed; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) departed out of Ireland, and arrived up in Cornwall even fast by the Castle of Tintagil.
<p/>And when King Mark understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was there arrived to fight for Ireland, then made King Mark great sorrow when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) understood that the good and noble knight Sir Marhaus was come.
<p/>For they knew no knight that durst have ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). For at that time Sir Marhaus was called one of the famousest and renowned knights of the world.
<p/>And thus Sir Marhaus abode in the sea, and every day he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sent unto King Mark for to pay the truage that was behind of seven year, other else to find a knight to fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) for the truage.
<p/>Then they of Cornwall let make cries in every place, that what knight would fight for to save the truage of Cornwall, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should be rewarded so that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should fare the better, term of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life.
<p/>Then some of the barons said to King Mark, and counselled him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to send to the court of King Arthur for to seek Sir Launcelot du Lake, that was that time named for the marvelloust knight of all the world.
<p/>Then there were some other barons that counselled the king not to do so, and said that it was labour in vain, because Sir Marhaus was a knight of the Round Table, therefore any of them will be loath to have ado with other, but if it were any knight at his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own request would fight disguised and unknown.
<p/>So the king and all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) barons assented that it was no bote to seek any knight of the Round Table.
<p/>This mean while came the language and the noise unto King Meliodas, how that Sir Marhaus abode battle fast by Tintagil, and how King Mark could find no manner knight to fight for him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>When young Tristram heard of this he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was wroth, and sore ashamed that there durst no knight in Cornwall have ado with Sir Marhaus of Ireland.
<p/>This manner of message Sir Marhaus sent daily unto King Mark. CHAPTER V. How Tristram enterprized the battle to fight for the truage of Cornwall, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was made knight.
<p/>THEREWITHAL Tristram went unto his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) father, King Meliodas, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) counsel what was best to do for to recover Cornwall from truage.
<p/>For, as meseemeth, said Sir Tristram, it were shame that Sir Marhaus, the queen's brother of Ireland, should go away unless that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) were foughten withal.
<p/>As for that, said King Meliodas, wit you well, son Tristram, that Sir Marhaus is called one of the best knights of the world, and Knight of the Table Round; and therefore I know no knight in this country that is able to match with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Alas, said Sir Tristram, that I am not made knight; and if Sir Marhaus should thus depart into Ireland, God let me never have worship: an
<p/>And sir, said Tristram, I pray you give me leave to ride to King Mark; and, so ye be not displeased, of King Mark
<p/>I were made knight I should match him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). will I be made knight. I will well, said King Meliodas, that ye be ruled as your courage will rule you.
<p/>In the meanwhile there came a messenger with letters of love from King Faramon of France's daughter unto Sir Tristram, that were full piteous letters, and in them were written many complaints of love; but Sir Tristram had no joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) letters nor regard unto her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>Then Sir Tristram thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) father much. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ready to ride into Cornwall. Also she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a little brachet that was passing fair.
<p/>But when the king's daughter understood that Sir Tristram would not love her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), as the book saith, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) died for sorrow.
<p/>And then the same squire that brought the letter and the brachet came again unto Sir Tristram, as after ye shall hear in the tale.
<p/>So this young Sir Tristram rode unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) eme, King Mark of Cornwall. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) heard say that there would no knight fight with Sir Marhaus.
<p/>Then yede Sir Tristram unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) eme and said: Sir, if ye will give me the order of knighthood, I will do battle with Sir Marhaus.
<p/>What are ye, said the king, and from whence be ye come? Sir, said Tristram, I come from King Meliodas that wedded your sister, and a gentleman wit
<p/>King Mark beheld Sir Tristram and saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was but a young man of age, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was passingly well made and big.
<p/>ye well I am. Fair sir, said the king, what is your name, and where were ye born? Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) again, my name is Tristram, and in the country of Liones was I born.
<p/>Ye say well, said the king; and if ye will do this battle I shall make you knight. Therefore I come to you, said Sir Tristram, and for none other cause.
<p/>And therewithal, anon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sent a messenger unto Sir Marhaus with letters that said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had found a young knight ready for to take the battle to the uttermost.
<p/>But then King Mark made him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knight. It may well be, said Sir Marhaus; but tell King Mark I will not fight with no knight but
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) be of blood royal, that is to say, other king's son, other queen's son, born of a prince or princess.
<p/>When King Mark understood that, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sent for Sir Tristram de Liones and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) what was the answer of Sir Marhaus.
<p/>Sithen that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) saith so, let him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wit that I am come of father side and mother side of as noble blood as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is: for, sir, now shall ye know that I am King Meliodas' son, born of your own sister, Dame Elizabeth, that died in the forest in the birth of me.
<p/>Then in all the haste the king let horse Sir Tristram, and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in the best manner that might be had or gotten for gold or silver.
<p/>And then King Mark sent unto Sir Marhaus, and did him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to wit that a better born man than he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was himself should fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) name is Sir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of King Mark's sister.
<p/>Then said Sir Tristram: O Jesu, said King Mark, ye are welcome fair nephew to me. Then was Sir Marhaus glad and blithe that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) should fight with such a gentleman.
<p/>And so by the assent of King Mark and of Sir Marhaus they let ordain that they should fight within an island nigh Sir Marhaus' ships; and so was Sir Tristram put into a vessel both his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and all that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) longed both for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) body and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse.
<p/>And when King Mark and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) barons of Cornwall beheld how young Sir Tristram departed with such a carriage to fight for the right of Cornwall, there was neither man nor woman of worship
<p/>Sir Tristram lacked nothing. but they wept to see and understand so young a knight to jeopardy himself for their right.
<p/>SO to shorten this tale, when Sir Tristram was arrived within the island he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) looked to the farther side, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw at an anchor six ships nigh to the land; and under the shadow of the ships upon the land, there hoved the noble knight, Sir Marhaus of Ireland.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram commanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) servant Gouvernail to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse to the land, and dress his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) harness at all manner of rights.
<p/>And then when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had so done he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) mounted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saddle well apparelled, and
<p/>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Tristram arrived into the Island for to furnish the battle with Sir Marhaus. his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield dressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shoulder, Tristram asked Gouvernail, Where is this knight that I shall have ado withal?
<p/>yonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hoveth under the umbre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ships on horseback, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>Sir, said Gouvernail, see ye him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) not? I weened ye had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); That is truth, said the noble knight, Sir Tristram, now I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well enough.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) commanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) servant Gouvernail to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) vessel again: And commend me unto mine eme King Mark, and pray him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), if that I be slain in this battle, for to inter my body as him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) seemed best; and as for me, let him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wit that I will never yield me for cowardice; and if I be slain and flee not, then they have lost no truage for me; and if so be that I flee or yield me as recreant, bid mine eme never bury me in Christian burials.
<p/>And upon thy life, said Sir Tristram to Gouvernail, come thou not nigh this island till that thou see me overcome or slain, or else that I win yonder knight.
<p/>So either departed from other sore weeping. CHAPTER VII. How Sir Tristram fought against Sir Marhaus and achieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) battle, and how Sir Marhaus fled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ship.
<p/>AND then Sir Marhaus avised Sir Tristram, and said thus: Young knight, Sir Tristram, what dost thou here? me sore repenteth of thy courage, for wit
<p/>well I have been assayed, and the best knights of this land have been assayed of my hand; and also I have matched with the best knights of the world, and therefore by my counsel return again unto thy vessel.
<p/>thou And fair knight, and well-proved knight, said Sir Tristram, thou shalt well wit I may not forsake thee in this quarrel, for I am for thy sake made knight.
<p/>well wit that I am a king's son born, and gotten upon a queen; and such promise I have made at my uncle's request and mine own seeking, that I shall fight with thee unto the uttermost, and deliver Cornwall from the old truage.
<p/>And also wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that this is the greatest cause that thou couragest me to have ado with thee, for thou art called one of the most renowned knights of the world, and because of that noise and fame that thou hast
<p/>, for never yet was I proved with good knight; and sithen I took the order of knighthood this day, I am well pleased that I may have ado with so good a knight as thou art.
<p/>And now wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that I cast me to get worship on thy body; and if that I be not proved, I trust to God that I shall be worshipfully proved upon thy body, and to deliver the country of Cornwall for ever from all manner of truage from Ireland for ever.
<p/>And thou shalt thou givest me courage to have ado with thee When Sir Marhaus had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) say what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said then thus again:
<p/>Fair knight, sithen it is so that thou castest to win worship of me, I let thee wit worship may thou none lose by me if thou mayest stand me three strokes
<p/>; for I let thee wit for my noble deeds, proved and seen, King Arthur made me Knight of the Table Round.
<p/>Then they began to feutre their spears, and they met so fiercely together that they smote either other down, both horse and all.
<p/>But Sir Marhaus smote Sir Tristram a great wound in the side with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) spear, and then they avoided their horses, and pulled out their swords, and threw their shields afore them.
<p/>And when they had stricken so together long, then they left their strokes, and foined at their breaths and visors; and when they saw that that might not prevail them, then they hurtled together like rams to bear either other down.
<p/>Thus they fought still more than half a day, and either were wounded passing sore, that the blood ran down freshly from them upon the ground.
<p/>By then Sir Tristram waxed more fresher than Sir Marhaus, and better winded and bigger; and with a mighty stroke he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote Sir Marhaus upon the helm such a buffet that it went through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) helm, and through the coif of steel, and through the brain-pan, and the sword stuck so fast in the helm and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) brain-pan that Sir Tristram pulled thrice at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword or ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might pull it out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head; and there Marhaus fell down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knees, the edge of Tristram's sword left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) brain-pan.
<p/>And suddenly Sir Marhaus rose grovelling, and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and so ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ships and fled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way, and Sir Tristram had ever his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword.
<p/>And then they lashed together as men that were wild and courageous. And when Sir Tristram saw Sir Marhaus withdraw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said: Ah!
<p/>thou dost thyself and thy kin great shame, for I am but a young knight, or now I was never proved, and rather than I should withdraw me from thee, I had rather be hewn in an hundred pieces.
<p/>Sir Knight of the Round Table, why withdrawest thou thee? Sir Marhaus answered no word but yede his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) way sore groaning.
<p/>Well, Sir Knight, said Sir Tristram, I promise thee thy sword and thy shield shall be mine; and thy shield shall I wear in all places where I ride on mine adventures, and in the sight of King Arthur and all the Round Table.
<p/>How Sir Marhaus after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was arrived in Ireland died of the stroke that Sir Tristram had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and how Tristram was hurt.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII. ANON Sir Marhaus and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellowship departed into Ireland. And as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came to the king, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) let search his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wounds.
<p/>And when his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head was searched a piece of Sir Tristram's sword was found therein, and might never be had out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head for no surgeons, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) died of Sir Tristram's sword; and that piece of the sword the queen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sister, kept it for ever with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) thought to be revenged an she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might.
<p/>Now turn we again unto Sir Tristram, that was sore wounded, and full sore bled that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might not within a little while,
<p/>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had taken cold, unnethe stir him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) limbs. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) down softly upon a little hill, and bled fast.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was come unto the land, King Mark took him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) arms, and the king and Sir Dinas, the seneschal, led Sir Tristram into the castle of Tintagil.
<p/>Then anon came Gouvernail, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) vessel; and the king and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) barons came with procession against him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). And then was he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) searched in the best manner, and laid in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bed.
<p/>And when King Mark saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) wounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) wept heartily, and so did all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) lords. So God me help, said King Mark, I would not for all my lands that my nephew died.
<p/>So Sir Tristram lay there a month and more, and ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was like to die of that stroke that Sir Marhaus smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) first with the spear.
<p/>Then was King Mark and all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) barons passing heavy, for they deemed none other but that Sir Tristram should not recover.
<p/>Then the king let send after all manner of leeches and surgeons, both unto men and women, and there was none that would behote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the life.
<p/>Then came there a lady that was a right wise lady, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said plainly unto King Mark, and to Sir Tristram, and to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) barons, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should never be whole but if Sir Tristram went in the same country that the venom came from, and in that country should he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) be holpen or else never.
<p/>For, as the French book saith, the spear's head was envenomed, that Sir Tristram might not be whole. Thus said the lady unto the king.
<p/>When King Mark understood that, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) let purvey for Sir Tristram a fair vessel, well victualled, and therein was put Sir Tristram, and Gouvernail with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) harp with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was put into the sea to sail into Ireland; and so by good fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) arrived up in Ireland, even fast by a castle where the king and the queen was; and at his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sat and harped in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bed a merry lay,
<p/>And when it was told the king and the queen of such a knight that was such an harper, anon the king sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and let search his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wounds, and then asked him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) name.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) answered, I am of the country of Liones, and my name is Tramtrist, that thus was wounded in a battle as I fought for a lady's right.
<p/>So God me help, said King Anguish, ye shall have all the help in this land that ye may have here; but I let you wit, in Cornwall
<p/>I had a great loss as ever had king, for there I lost the best knight of the world; his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) name was Marhaus, a full noble knight, and Knight of the Table Round; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) told Sir Tristram wherefore Sir Marhaus was slain.
<p/>such one heard they never none in Ireland before that time. Sir Tristram made semblant as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had been sorry, and better knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) how it was than the king.
<p/>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Tristram was put to the keeping of La Beale Isoud first for to be healed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wound.
<p/>THEN the king for great favour made Tramtrist to be put in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) daughter's ward and keeping, because she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was a noble surgeon.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had searched him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) found in the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wound that therein was poison, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) healed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) within a while; and therefore Tramtrist cast great love to La Beale Isoud, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) was at that time the fairest maid and lady of the world.
<p/>And at that time Sir Palamides, the Saracen, was in that country, and well cherished with the king and the queen.
<p/>And every day Sir Palamides drew unto La Beale Isoud and proffered her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) many gifts, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) passingly well.
<p/>And there Tramtrist learned her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) to harp, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) began to have a great fantasy unto him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). All that espied Tramtrist, and full well knew he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Sir Palamides for a noble knight and a mighty man.
<p/>Sir Tramtrist had great despite at Sir Palamides, for La Beale Isoud told Tramtrist that Palamides was in will to be christened for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) sake.
<p/>Then it befell that King Anguish let cry a great jousts and a great tournament for a lady that was called the Lady of the Launds, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was nigh cousin unto the king.
<p/>And wit you well Thus was there great envy betwixt Tramtrist and Sir Palamides. And what man won her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), three days after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should wed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and have all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) lands.
<p/>This cry was made in England, Wales, Scotland, and also in France and in Brittany. It befell upon a day La Beale Isoud came unto Sir Tramtrist, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Beale</b></font>) of this tournament.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beale</b></font>) answered and said: Fair lady, I am but a feeble knight, and but late I had been dead had not your good ladyship been.
<p/>Now, fair lady, what would ye I should do in this matter? well ye wot, my lady, that I may not joust.
<p/>Sir Palamides shall be there, and to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) may; and therefore Tramtrist, I pray you for to be there, for else Sir Palamides is like to win the degree.
<p/>Madam, said Tramtrist, as for that, it may be so, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is a proved knight, and I am but a young knight and late made; and the first battle that I did it mishapped me to be sore wounded as ye see.
<p/>But an I wist ye would be my better lady, at that tournament I will be, so that ye will keep my counsel and let no creature have knowledge that I shall joust but yourself, and such as ye will to keep your counsel, my poor person shall I jeopard there for your sake, that, peradventure, Sir Palamides shall know when that I come.
<p/>Thereto, said La Beale Isoud, do your best, and as I can, said La Beale Isoud, I shall purvey horse and armour for you at my device.
<p/>Ah, Tramtrist, said La Beale Isoud, why will ye not have ado at that tournament? well I wot As ye will so be it, said Sir Tramtrist, I will be at your commandment.
<p/>So at the day of jousts there came Sir Palamides with a black shield, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) overthrew many knights, that all the people had marvel of him (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>).
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) put to the worse Sir Gawaine, Gaheris, Agravaine, Bagdemagus, Kay, Dodinas le Savage, Sagramore le Desirous, Gumret le Petit, and Griflet le Fise de Dieu.
<p/>And then all manner of knights were adread of Sir Palamides, and many called him (<font color='blue'><b>Petit</b></font>) the Knight with the Black Shield.
<p/>All these the first day Sir Palamides struck down to the earth. So that day Sir Palamides had great worship. Then came King Anguish unto Tramtrist, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would not joust.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said, I was but late hurt, and as yet I dare not adventure me. Then came there the same squire that was sent from the king's daughter of France unto Sir Tristram.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had espied Sir Tristram he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell flat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) feet. All that espied La Beale Isoud, what courtesy the squire made unto Sir Tristram.
<p/>And therewithal suddenly Sir Tristram ran unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) squire, whose name was Hebes le Renoumes, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) heartily in no wise to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name.
<p/>How Sir Tristram won the degree at a tournament in Ireland, and there made Palamides to bear no more harness in a year.
<p/>Sir, said Hebes, I will not discover your name but if ye command me. CHAPTER X. THEN Sir Tristram asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did in those countries.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, I came hither with Sir Gawaine for to be made knight, and if it please you, of your hands that I may be made knight.
<p/>Then had La Beale Isoud great suspicion unto Tramtrist, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was some man of worship proved, and therewith she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) comforted herself, and cast more love unto him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) had done to-fore.
<p/>And so on the morn Sir Palamides made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ready to come into the field as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did the first day.
<p/>Await upon me as to-morn secretly, and in the field I shall make you a knight. And there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) smote down the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King of Scots.
<p/>Then had La Beale Isoud ordained and well arrayed Sir Tristram in white horse and harness. And right so she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) let put him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) out at a privy postern,
<p/>and so he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came into the field as it had been a bright angel. And anon Sir Palamides espied him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) feutred a spear unto Sir Tramtrist, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) again unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>And then there was a great noise of people: some said Sir Palamides had a fall, some said the Knight with the Black Shield had a fall.
<p/>And there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palamides unto the earth. And wit you well La Beale Isoud was passing glad.
<p/>And then Sir Gawaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fellows nine had marvel what knight it might be that had smitten down Sir Palamides.
<p/>Then would there none joust with Tramtrist, but all that there were forsook him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), most and least. Then Sir Tristram made Hebes a knight, and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to put himself forth, and did right well that day.
<p/>And when Sir Palamides had received this fall, wit ye well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was sore ashamed, and as privily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) withdrew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) out of the field.
<p/>All that espied Sir Tristram, and lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode after Sir Palamides and overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) turn, for better he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would assay him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) or ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) departed.
<p/>So after Sir Hebes held him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) with Sir Tristram. Then Sir Palamides turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and either lashed at other with their swords.
<p/>But at the first stroke Sir Tristram smote down Palamides, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) such a stroke upon the head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell to the earth.
<p/>So then Tristram bade yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and do his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) commandment, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). When Sir Palamides beheld his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) countenance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) dread his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) buffets so, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) granted all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) askings.
<p/>First, upon pain of your life that ye forsake my lady La Beale Isoud, and in no manner wise that ye draw not to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>).
<p/>Well said, said Sir Tristram, this shall be your charge. Also this twelvemonth and a day that ye bear none armour nor none harness of war.
<p/>Now promise me this, or here shalt thou die. Alas, said Palamides, for ever am I ashamed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sware as Sir Tristram had commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And so Sir Tristram turned again to the castle where was La Beale Isoud; and by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met with a damosel that asked after Sir Launcelot, that won the Dolorous Guard worshipfully; and this damosel asked Sir Tristram what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was.
<p/>For it was told her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that smote down Sir Palamides, by whom the ten knights of King Arthur's were smitten down.
<p/>Then the damosel prayed Sir Tristram to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was, and whether that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were Sir Launcelot du Lake, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) deemed that there was no knight in the world
<p/>Then for despite and anger Sir Palamides cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) harness, and threw them away. might do such deeds of arms
<p/>Fair damosel, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well that I am not Sir Launcelot, for I was never of such prowess, but in God is all that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may make me as good a knight as the good knight Sir Launcelot.
<p/>Now, gentle knight, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), put up thy visor; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) beheld his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) visage she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw never a better man's visage, nor a better faring knight.
<p/>And then when the damosel knew certainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was not Sir Launcelot, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leave, and departed from him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And then Sir Tristram rode privily unto the postern, where kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) La Beale Isoud, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) good cheer, and thanked God of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) good speed.
<p/>So anon, within a while the king and the queen understood that it was Tramtrist that smote down Sir Palamides; then was he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) much made of, more than he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was before.
<p/>How the queen espied that Sir Tristram had slain her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) brother Sir Marhaus by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword, and in what jeopardy he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was.
<p/>but if it were Launcelot. CHAPTER XI. THUS was Sir Tramtrist long there well cherished with the king and the queen, and namely with La Beale Isoud.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bain the queen and Isoud, her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) daughter, roamed up and down in the chamber; and therewhiles Gouvernail and Hebes attended upon Tramtrist, and the queen beheld his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sword thereas it lay upon his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bed.
<p/>And then by unhap the queen drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sword and beheld it a long while, and both they thought it a passing fair sword; but within a foot and an half of the point there was a great piece thereof out-broken of the edge.
<p/>And when the queen espied that gap in the sword, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) of a piece of a sword that was found in the brain-pan of Sir Marhaus, the good knight that was her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Alas then, said she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) unto her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) daughter, La Beale Isoud, this is the same traitor knight that slew my brother, thine eme.
<p/>So upon a day the queen and La Beale Isoud made a bain for Sir Tramtrist. When Isoud heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) say so she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) was passing sore abashed, for passing
<p/>Anon therewithal the queen went unto her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) own chamber, and sought her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) coffer, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) took out the piece or the sword that was pulled out of Sir Marhaus' head after that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was dead.
<p/>well she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) loved Tramtrist, and full well she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) knew the cruelness of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) mother the queen. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) ran with that piece of iron to the sword that lay upon the bed.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) put that piece of steel and iron unto the sword, it was as meet as it might be when it was new broken.
<p/>And then the queen gripped that sword in her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) hand fiercely, and with all her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) might she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) ran straight upon Tramtrist where he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bain, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) had rived him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) through had not Sir Hebes gotten her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) arms, and pulled the sword from her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), and else she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) had thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) through.
<p/>Then when she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was let of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) evil will she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) ran to the King Anguish, her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) husband, and said on her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) knees:
<p/>O my lord, here have ye in your house that traitor knight that slew my brother and your servant, that noble knight, Sir Marhaus.
<p/>Who is that, said King Anguish, and where is he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)? Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) said, it is Sir Tramtrist, the same knight that my daughter healed.
<p/>Alas, said the king, therefore am I right heavy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is a full noble knight as ever I saw in field.
<p/>But I charge you, said the king to the queen, that ye have not ado with that knight, but let me deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Then the king went into the chamber unto Sir Tramtrist, and then was he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) gone unto his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) chamber, and the king found him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) all ready armed to mount upon his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse.
<p/>When the king saw him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) all ready armed to go unto horseback, the king said: Nay, Tramtrist, it will not avail to compare thee against me; but thus much I shall do for my worship and for thy love; in so much as thou art within my court
<p/>it were no worship for me to slay thee: therefore upon this condition I will give thee leave for to depart from this court in safety, so thou wilt tell me who was thy father, and what is thy name, and if thou slew Sir Marhaus, my brother.
<p/>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Tristram departed from the king and La Beale Isoud out of Ireland for to come into Cornwall.
<p/>SIR, said Tristram, now I shall tell you all the truth: my father's name is Sir Meliodas, King of Liones, and my mother hight Elizabeth, that was sister unto King Mark of Cornwall; and my mother died of me in the forest, and because thereof she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) commanded, or she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died, that when I were christened they should christen me Tristram; and because I would not be known in this country
<p/>I turned my name and let me call Tramtrist; and for the truage of Cornwall I fought for my eme's sake, and for the right of Cornwall that ye had posseded many years.
<p/>And wit ye well, said Tristram unto the king, I did the battle for the love of mine uncle, King Mark, and for the love of the country of Cornwall, and for to increase mine honour; for that same day that I fought with Sir Marhaus I was made knight, and never or then did I battle with no knight, and from me he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went alive, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword behind.
<p/>So God me help, said the king, I may not say but ye did as a knight should, and it was your part to do for your quarrel, and to increase your worship as a knight should
<p/>; howbeit I may not maintain you in this country with my worship, unless that I should displease my barons, and my wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kin.
<p/>Sir, said Tristram, I thank you of your good lordship that I have had with you here, and the great goodness my lady, your daughter, hath shewed me, and
<p/>therefore, said Sir Tristram, it may so happen that ye shall win more by my life than by my death, for in the parts of England
<p/>I may do you service at some season, that ye shall be glad that ever ye shewed me your good lordship.
<p/>With more I promise you as I am true knight, that in all places I shall be my lady your daughter's servant and knight in right and in wrong, and I shall never fail her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), to do as much as a knight may do.
<p/>Also I beseech your good grace that I may take my leave at my lady, your daughter, and at all the barons and knights.
<p/>it may happen I will well, said the king. Then Sir Tristram went unto La Beale Isoud and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>).
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) all, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would not be known, and how a lady told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should never be whole till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came into this country where the poison was made, wherethrough I was near my death had not your ladyship been.
<p/>O gentle knight, said La Beale Isoud, full woe am I of thy departing, for I saw never man that I owed so good will to.
<p/>Madam, said Sir Tristram, ye shall understand that my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of his (<font color='blue'><b>Meliodas</b></font>) queen.
<p/>And therewithal she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) wept heartily. And I promise you faithfully that I shall be all the days of my life your knight.
<p/>but by your assent; and to whom that ye will I shall be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will I have, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will have me if ye will consent.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram gave her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) a ring, and she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) another; and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) departed from her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) making great dole and lamentation; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) straight went unto the court among all the barons, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leave at most and least,
<p/>and openly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said among them all: Fair lords, now it is so that I must depart: if there be any man here that I have offended unto, or that any man be with me
<p/>Gramercy, said La Beale Isoud, and I promise you there-against that I shall not be married this seven years grieved, let complain him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here afore me or that ever I depart, and I shall amend it unto my power.
<p/>And if there be any that will proffer me wrong, or say of me wrong or shame behind my back, say it now or never, and here is my body to make it good, body against body.
<p/>And all they stood still, there was not one that would say one word; yet were there some knights that were of the queen's blood, and of Sir Marhaus' blood, but they would not meddle with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>SO Sir Tristram departed, and took the sea, and with good wind he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) arrived up at Tintagil in Cornwall; and when King Mark was whole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) prosperity there came tidings that Sir Tristram was arrived, and whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wounds: thereof was King Mark passing glad, and so were all the barons; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) time he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rode unto his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) father, King Meliodas, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had all the cheer that the king and the queen could make him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Tristram and King Mark hurted each other for the love of a knight's wife. And then largely King Meliodas and his (<font color='blue'><b>Meliodas</b></font>) queen departed of their lands and goods to Sir Tristram.
<p/>Then by the license of King Meliodas, his (<font color='blue'><b>Meliodas</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Meliodas</b></font>) returned again unto the court of King Mark, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lived in great joy long time, until at the last there befell a jealousy and an unkindness betwixt King Mark and Sir Tristram, for they loved both one lady.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was an earl's wife that hight Sir Segwarides. And this lady loved Sir Tristram passingly well. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a passing fair lady, and that espied Sir Tristram well.
<p/>So it fell upon a day this lady sent a dwarf unto Sir Tristram, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would be with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the night next following.
<p/>Then King Mark understood that and was jealous, for King Mark loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passingly well. Also she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) charged you that ye come not to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
<p/>but if ye be well armed, for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lover was called a good knight. Sir Tristram answered to the dwarf: Recommend me unto my lady, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) I will not fail
<p/>And King Mark espied that the dwarf was with Sir Tristram upon message from Segwarides' wife; then King Mark sent for the dwarf, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was come he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) made the dwarf by force to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) all, why and wherefore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) came on message from Sir Tristram.
<p/>Now, said King Mark, go where thou wilt, and upon pain of death that thou say no word that thou spakest with me; so the dwarf departed from the king.
<p/>And that same night that the steven was set betwixt Segwarides' wife and Sir Tristram, King Mark armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) ready, and took two knights of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) counsel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>); and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) rode afore for to abide by the way for to wait upon Sir Tristram.
<p/>And as Sir Tristram came riding upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, King Mark came hurtling upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) two knights suddenly.
<p/>but I will be with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the term that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hath set me. And with this answer the dwarf departed. And all three smote him (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) with their spears, and King Mark hurt Sir Tristram on the breast right sore.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram feutred his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear, and smote his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) uncle, King Mark, so sore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) rashed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) to the earth, and bruised him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) lay still in a swoon, and long it was or ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) might wield himself.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) ran to the one knight, and eft to the other, and smote them to the cold earth, that they lay still.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Tristram rode forth sore wounded to the lady, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) abiding him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) at a postern. CHAPTER XIV.
<p/>AND there she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fair, and either halsed other in arms, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) let put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse in the best wise, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) unarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And so they supped lightly, and went to bed with great joy and pleasaunce; and so in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) raging he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took no keep of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) green wound that King Mark had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>How Sir Tristram lay with the lady, and how her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband fought with Sir Tristram. And so Sir Tristram be-bled both the over sheet and the nether, and pillows, and head sheet.
<p/>And within a while there came one afore, that warned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord was near-hand within a bow-draught. So she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made Sir Tristram to arise, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and so departed.
<p/>By then was come Segwarides, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bed troubled and broken, and went near and beheld it by candle light, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw that there had lain a wounded knight.
<p/>Ah, false traitress, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, why hast thou betrayed me? And therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) swang out a sword, and said: But if thou tell me who hath been here, here thou shalt die.
<p/>Ah, my lord, mercy, said the lady, and held up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, saying: Slay me not, and I shall tell you all who hath been here.
<p/>Tell anon, said Segwarides, to me all the truth. Anon for dread she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said: Here was Sir Tristram with me, and by the way as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came to me
<p/>ward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was sore wounded. Ah, false traitress, said Segwarides, where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) become? Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is armed, and departed on horseback, not yet hence half a mile.
<p/>Ye say well, said Segwarides. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lightly, and gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and rode after Sir Tristram that rode straightway unto Tintagil.
<p/>And within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) overtook Sir Tristram, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), Turn, false traitor knight. And Sir Tristram anon turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And therewithal Segwarides smote Sir Tristram with a spear that it all to-brast; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) swang out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword and smote fast at Sir Tristram.
<p/>Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, I counsel you that ye smite no more, howbeit for the wrongs that I have done you I will forbear you as long as I may.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword, and hurtled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fiercely, and through the waist of the body he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote Sir Segwarides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell to the earth in a swoon.
<p/>Nay, said Segwarides, that shall not be, for either thou shalt die or I. And so Sir Tristram departed and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) there.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode unto Tintagil and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lodging secretly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would not be known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was hurt.
<p/>Also Sir Segwarides' men rode after their master, whom they found lying in the field sore wounded, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) home on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lay long or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) were whole, but at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) recovered.
<p/>Also King Mark would not be aknown of that Sir Tristram and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had met that night. And as for Sir Tristram, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knew not that King Mark had met with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>But as long as King Mark lived he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) loved never Sir Tristram after that; though there was fair speech, love was there none.
<p/>And thus it passed many weeks and days, and all was forgiven and forgotten; for Sir Segwarides durst not have ado with Sir Tristram, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) noble prowess, and also because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was nephew unto King Mark; therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) let it overslip: for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) that hath a privy hurt is loath to have a shame outward.
<p/>And so the king askance came to Sir Tristram, to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lay sick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bed. CHAPTER XV.
<p/>How Sir Bleoberis demanded the fairest lady in King Mark's court, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) took away, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was fought with.
<p/>THEN it befell upon a day that the good knight Bleoberis de Ganis, brother to Blamore de Ganis, and nigh cousin unto the good knight Sir Launcelot du Lake, this Bleoberis came unto the court of King Mark, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) asked of King Mark a boon, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) what gift that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) would ask in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) court.
<p/>When the king heard him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ask so, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) marvelled of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) asking, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was a knight of the Round Table, and of a great renown, King Mark granted him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) whole asking.
<p/>Then, said Sir Bleoberis, I will have the fairest lady in your court that me list to choose. I may not say nay, said King Mark; now choose at your adventure.
<p/>And so Sir Bleoberis did choose Sir Segwarides' wife, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by the hand, and so went his (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) way with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) horse and gart
<p/>When Sir Segwarides heard tell that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) lady was gone with a knight of King Arthur's court, then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) armed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and rode after that knight for to rescue his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lady.
<p/>set her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) behind his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) squire, and rode upon his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) way. So when Bleoberis was gone with this lady, King Mark and all the court was wroth that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was away.
<p/>Then were there certain ladies that knew that there were great love between Sir Tristram and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and also that lady loved Sir Tristram above all other knights.
<p/>Then there was one lady that rebuked Sir Tristram in the horriblest wise, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) coward knight, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would for shame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knighthood
<p/>see a lady so shamefully be taken away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) uncle's court. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) meant that either of them had loved other with entire heart.
<p/>But Sir Tristram answered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thus: Fair lady, it is not my part to have ado in such matters while her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord and husband is present here; and if it had been that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord had not been here in this court, then for the worship of this court peradventure I would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) champion, and if so be Sir Segwarides speed
<p/>Then within a while came one of Sir Segwarides' squires, and told in the court that Sir Segwarides was beaten sore and wounded to the point of death; as he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) would have rescued his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) lady Sir Bleoberis overthrew him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) and sore hath wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>).
<p/>not well, it may happen that I will speak with that good knight or ever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) pass from this country. Then was King Mark heavy thereof, and all the court.
<p/>When Sir Tristram heard of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was ashamed and sore grieved; and then was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) soon armed and on horseback, and Gouvernail, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) servant, bare his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield and spear.
<p/>And so as Sir Tristram rode fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met with Sir Andred his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) cousin, that by the commandment of King Mark was sent to bring forth, an ever it lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) power, two knights of Arthur's court, that rode by the country to seek their adventures.
<p/>So God me help, said Sir Andred, there was never worse with me, for here by the commandment of King Mark
<p/>I was sent to fetch two knights of King Arthur's court, and that one beat me and wounded me, and set nought by my message.
<p/>Fair cousin, said Sir Tristram, ride on your way, and if I may meet them it may happen I shall revenge you.
<p/>So Sir Andred rode into Cornwall, and Sir Tristram rode after the two knights, the which one hight Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage.
<p/>When Sir Tristram saw Sir Andred he (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) what tidings. CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Tristram fought with two knights of the Round Table.
<p/>Sir, said Gouvernail unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) master, Sir, I would counsel you not to have ado with them, for they be two proved knights of Arthur's court.
<p/>THEN within a while Sir Tristram saw them afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), two likely knights. As for that, said Sir Tristram, have ye no doubt
<p/>but I will have ado with them to increase my worship, for it is many day sithen I did any deeds of arms.
<p/>And therewithal anon Sir Tristram asked them from whence they came, and whither they would, and what they did in those marches.
<p/>Sir Sagramore looked upon Sir Tristram, and had scorn of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) words, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) again, Fair knight, be ye a knight of Cornwall?
<p/>For it is seldom seen, said Sir Sagramore, that ye Cornish knights be valiant men of arms; for within these two hours there met us one of your Cornish knights, and great words he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornish</b></font>) spake, and anon with little
<p/>Do as ye list, said Gouvernail. Whereby ask ye it? said Sir Tristram. might he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was laid to the earth. And, as I trow, said Sir Sagramore, ye shall have the same handsel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had.
<p/>Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, it may so happen that I may better withstand than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did, and whether ye will or nill I will have ado with you, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was my cousin that ye beat.
<p/>And therefore here do your best, and wit ye well but if ye quit you the better here upon this ground, one knight of Cornwall shall beat you both.
<p/>When Sir Dodinas le Savage heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) say so he (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) gat a spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Savage</b></font>) hand, and said, Sir knight, keep well thyself:
<p/>And Sir Dodinas' spear brast in-sunder, but Sir Tristram smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) with a more might, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) clean over the horse-croup, that nigh he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) neck.
<p/>And then they departed and came together as it had been thunder. When Sir Sagramore saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellow have such a fall he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) marvelled what knight he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might be.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might, and Sir Tristram against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and they came together as the thunder, and there Sir Tristram smote Sir Sagramore a strong buffet, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bare his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to the earth, and in the falling he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) brake his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thigh.
<p/>When this was done Sir Tristram asked them: Fair knights, will ye any more? Be there no bigger knights in the court of King Arthur?
<p/>it is to you shame to say of us knights of Cornwall dishonour, for it may happen a Cornish knight may match you.
<p/>That is truth, said Sir Sagramore, that have we well proved; but I require thee, said Sir Sagramore, tell us your right name, by the faith and troth that ye owe to the high order of knighthood.
<p/>Ye charge me with a great thing, said Sir Tristram, and sithen ye list to wit it, ye shall know and understand that my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, King Meliodas' son, and nephew unto King Mark.
<p/>Then were they two knights fain that they had met with Tristram, and so they prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to abide in their fellowship.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Tristram, for I must have ado with one of your fellows, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name is Sir Bleoberis de Ganis.
<p/>God speed you well, said Sir Sagramore and Dodinas. Sir Tristram departed and rode onward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way. And then was
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ware before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in a valley where rode Sir Bleoberis, with Sir Segwarides' lady, that rode behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) squire upon a palfrey.
<p/>How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Bleoberis for a lady, and how the lady was put to choice to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would go.
<p/>CHAPTER XVII. THEN Sir Tristram rode more than a pace until that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had overtaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). Then spake Sir Tristram: Abide, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, Knight of Arthur's court, bring again that lady, or deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to me.
<p/>I will do neither, said Bleoberis, for I dread no Cornish knight so sore that me list to deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Why, said Sir Tristram, may not a Cornish knight do as well as another knight?
<p/>this same day two knights of your court within this three mile met with me, and or ever we departed they found a Cornish knight good enough for them both.
<p/>They told me, said Sir Tristram, that the one of them hight Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage.
<p/>so God me help, they were two good knights and men of great worship, and if ye have beat them both ye must needs be a good knight; but if it so be ye have beat them both, yet shall ye not fear me, but ye shall beat me or ever ye have this lady.
<p/>What were their names? said Bleoberis. Ah, said Sir Bleoberis, have ye met with them? Then defend you, said Sir Tristram.
<p/>Then they avoided their horses, and lashed together eagerly with swords, and mightily, now tracing and traversing on the right hand and on the left hand more than two hours.
<p/>So they departed and came together like thunder, and either bare other down, horse and all, to the earth. And sometime they rushed together with such a might that they lay both grovelling on the ground.
<p/>Then Sir Bleoberis de Ganis stert aback, and said thus: Now, gentle good knight, a while hold your hands, and let us speak together.
<p/>Say what ye will, said Tristram, and I will answer you. Sir, said Bleoberis, I would wit of whence ye be, and of whom ye be come, and what is your name?
<p/>well I am King Meliodas' son, and my mother is King Mark's sister, and my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and King Mark is mine uncle.
<p/>Truly, said Bleoberis, I am right glad of you, for ye are he (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) that slew Marhaus the knight, hand for hand in an island, for the truage of Cornwall; also ye overcame Sir Palamides the good knight, at a tournament in an island, where ye beat Sir Gawaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) nine fellows.
<p/>So God me help, said Sir Tristram, I fear not to tell you my name. Wit ye So God me help, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well that I am the same knight
<p/>well that my name is Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, and my brother hight Sir Blamore de Ganis, that is called a good knight, and we be sister's children unto my lord Sir Launcelot du Lake, that we call one of the best knights of the world.
<p/>That is truth, said Sir Tristram, Sir Launcelot is called peerless of courtesy and of knighthood; and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sake, said Sir Tristram, I will not with my good will fight no more with you, for the great love I have to Sir Launcelot du Lake.
<p/>In good faith, said Bleoberis, as for me I will be loath to fight with you; but sithen ye follow me here to have this lady, I shall proffer you kindness, courtesy, and gentleness right here upon this ground.
<p/>; now I have told you my name, tell me yours with good will. Wit ye This lady shall be betwixt us both, and to whom that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will go, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in peace.
<p/>I will well, said Tristram, for, as I deem, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will leave you and come to me. Ye shall prove it anon, said Bleoberis.
<p/>CHAPTER XVIII. How the lady forsook Sir Tristram and abode with Sir Bleoberis, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) desired to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Wit ye well, Sir Tristram de Liones, that but late thou wast the man in the world that I most loved and trusted, and I weened thou hadst loved me again above all ladies; but when thou sawest this knight lead me away thou madest no cheer to rescue me, but suffered my lord Segwarides ride after me; but until that time I weened thou haddest loved me, and therefore now I will leave thee, and never love thee more.
<p/>So when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was set betwixt them both she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said these words unto Sir Tristram: And therewithal she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went unto Sir Bleoberis.
<p/>When Sir Tristram saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) do so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was wonderly wroth with that lady, and ashamed to come to the court.
<p/>Sir Tristram, said Sir Bleoberis, ye are in the default, for I hear by this lady's words she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) before this day trusted you above all earthly knights,
<p/>and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saith, ye have deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) , therefore wit ye well , there may no man hold that will away; and rather than ye should be heartily displeased with me
<p/>I would ye had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), an she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would abide with you. Nay, said the lady, so God me help I will never go with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that I loved most
<p/>And therefore, Sir Tristram, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, ride as thou came, for though thou haddest overcome this knight, as ye was likely, with thee
<p/>And I shall pray this knight so fair of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) knighthood, that or ever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) pass this country, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will lead me to the abbey where my lord Sir Segwarides lieth.
<p/>So God me help, said Bleoberis, I let you wit, good knight Sir Tristram, because King Mark gave me the choice of a gift in this court, and so this lady liked me best--notwithstanding, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is wedded and hath a lord, and I have fulfilled my quest, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shall be sent unto her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband again, and in especial most for your sake, Sir Tristram; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would go with you I would ye had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>I weened he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had loved me. never would I have gone. I thank you, said Sir Tristram, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) love I shall beware what manner
<p/>, I should have been the first that should have followed you; but sithen that ye have refused me, as I am true
<p/>a lady I shall love or trust; for had her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord, Sir Segwarides, been away from the court knight I shall
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) know passingly well that I shall love or trust. And so they took their leave one from the other and departed.
<p/>And so Sir Tristram rode unto Tintagil, and Sir Bleoberis rode unto the abbey where Sir Segwarides lay sore wounded, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady, and departed as a noble knight; and when Sir Segwarides saw his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was greatly comforted; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that Sir Tristram had done great battle with Sir Bleoberis, and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again.
<p/>These words pleased Sir Segwarides right well, that Sir Tristram would do so much; and so that lady told all the battle unto King Mark betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Bleoberis.
<p/>CHAPTER XIX. How King Mark sent Sir Tristram for La Beale Isoud toward Ireland, and how by fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) arrived into England.
<p/>THEN when this was done King Mark cast always in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) heart how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) might destroy Sir Tristram. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) imagined in himself to send Sir Tristram into Ireland for La Beale Isoud.
<p/>For Sir Tristram had so praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) beauty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) goodness that King Mark said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) would wed her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>), whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) prayed Sir Tristram to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way into Ireland for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) on message.
<p/>Notwithstanding, Sir Tristram would not refuse the message for no danger nor peril that might fall, for the pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) uncle, but to go he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ready in the most goodliest wise that might be devised.
<p/>For Sir Tristram took with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the most goodliest knights that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might find in the court; and they were arrayed, after the guise that was then used, in the goodliest manner.
<p/>And all this was done to the intent to slay Sir Tristram. So Sir Tristram departed and took the sea with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellowship.
<p/>a tempest took him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellowship, and drove them back into the coast of England; and there they arrived fast by Camelot, and full fain they were to take the land.
<p/>And when they were landed Sir Tristram set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) pavilion upon the land of Camelot, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) let hang his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield upon the pavilion.
<p/>And anon, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was in the broad sea And that same day came two knights of King Arthur's, that one was Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Morganor.
<p/>And they touched the shield, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) come out of the pavilion for to joust, an he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) would joust. Ye shall be answered, said Sir Tristram, an ye will tarry a little while.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ready, and first he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote down Sir Ector de Maris, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote down Sir Morganor, all with one spear, and sore bruised them.
<p/>And when they lay upon the earth they asked Sir Tristram what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was, and of what country he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was knight.
<p/>Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well that I am of Cornwall. Alas, said Sir Ector, now am I ashamed that ever any Cornish knight should overcome me.
<p/>And then for despite Sir Ector put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) armour from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>), and went on foot, and would not ride. CHAPTER XX.
<p/>THEN it fell that Sir Bleoberis and Sir Blamore de Ganis, that were brethren, they had summoned the King Anguish of Ireland for to come to Arthur's court upon pain of forfeiture of King Arthur's good grace.
<p/>And if the King of Ireland came not in, at the day assigned and set, the king should lose his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lands.
<p/>So it happened that at the day assigned, King Arthur neither Sir Launcelot might not be there for to give the judgment, for King Arthur was with Sir Launcelot at the Castle Joyous Garde.
<p/>How King Anguish of Ireland was summoned to come to King Arthur's court for treason. And so King Arthur assigned King Carados and the King of Scots to be there that day as judges.
<p/>Then was there Sir Blamore de Ganis, and appealed the King of Ireland of treason, that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had slain a cousin of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) court in Ireland by treason.
<p/>The king was sore abashed of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) accusation, for-why he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was come at the summons of King Arthur, and or he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came at Camelot
<p/>So when the kings were at Camelot King Anguish of Ireland was come to know his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) accusers. he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wist not wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was sent after.
<p/>And when the king heard Sir Blamore say his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) understood well there was none other remedy but for to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knightly; for the custom was such in those days, that an any man were appealed of any treason or murder he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should fight body for body, or else to find another knight for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>So when King Anguish understood his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) accusing he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was passing heavy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knew Sir Blamore de Ganis that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was a noble knight, and of noble knights come.
<p/>Then the King of Ireland was simply purveyed of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) answer; therefore the judges gave him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) respite by the third day to give his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) answer.
<p/>And all manner of murders in those days were called treason. So the king departed unto his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lodging. The meanwhile there came a lady by Sir Tristram's pavilion making great dole.
<p/>, said the lady, I am ashamed unless that some good knight help me; for a great lady of worship sent by me a fair child and a rich, unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, and hereby there met with me a knight, and threw me down from my palfrey, and took away the child from me.
<p/>Well, my lady, said Sir Tristram, and for my lord Sir Launcelot's sake I shall get you that child again, or else I shall be beaten for it.
<p/>And so Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and asked the lady which way the knight rode; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>What aileth you, said Sir Tristram, that ye make such dole? Ah, fair knight And he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode after him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) overtook that knight.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) turn and give again the child. CHAPTER XXI. How Sir Tristram rescued a child from a knight, and how Gouvernail told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) of King Anguish.
<p/>THE knight turned his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horse and made him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ready to fight. And then Sir Tristram smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) with a sword such a buffet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) tumbled to the earth.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) unto Sir Tristram. Then come thy way, said Sir Tristram, and bring the child to the lady again.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse meekly and rode with Sir Tristram; and then by the way Sir Tristram asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, My name is Breuse Saunce Pite. So when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had delivered that child to the lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said:
<p/>Then Sir Tristram let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) go again that sore repented him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) after, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was a great foe unto many good knights of King Arthur's court.
<p/>Then when Sir Tristram was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) pavilion Gouvernail, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) man, came and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) how that King Anguish of Ireland was come thither, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was put in great distress; and there Gouvernail told Sir Tristram how King Anguish was summoned and appealed of murder.
<p/>So God me help, said Sir Tristram, these be the best tidings that ever came to me this seven years, for now shall the King of Ireland have need of my help; for I daresay there is no knight in this country that is not of Arthur's court dare do battle with Sir Blamore de Ganis; and for to win the love of the King of Ireland I will take the battle upon me; and therefore Gouvernail bring me, I charge thee, to the king.
<p/>Sir, as in this the child is well remedied. Then Gouvernail went unto King Anguish of Ireland, and saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fair.
<p/>The king welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would. Sir, said Gouvernail, here is a knight near hand that desireth to speak with you
<p/>Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), it is Sir Tristram de Liones, that for your good grace that ye showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) in your lands will reward you in this country.
<p/>: he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) bade me say he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) would do you service. What knight is he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)? said the king. Come on, fellow, said the king, with me anon and show me unto Sir Tristram.
<p/>So the king took a little hackney and but few fellowship with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), until he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came unto Sir Tristram's pavilion. And when Sir Tristram saw the king he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ran unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and would have holden his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) stirrup.
<p/>My gracious lord, said Sir Tristram, gramercy of your great goodnesses showed unto me in your marches and lands: and at that time I promised you to do you service
<p/>But the king leapt from his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse lightly, and either halsed other in their arms. an ever it lay in my power.
<p/>And, gentle knight, said the king unto Sir Tristram, now have I great need of you, never had I so great need of no knight's help.
<p/>I shall tell you, said the king: I am summoned and appealed from my country for the death of a knight that was kin unto the good knight Sir Launcelot; wherefore
<p/>Sir Blamore de Ganis, brother to Sir Bleoberis hath appealed me to fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ganis</b></font>), outher to find a knight in my stead.
<p/>And well I wot, said the king, these that are come of King Ban's blood, as Sir Launcelot and these other, are passing good knights, and hard men for to win in battle as any that I know now living.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Tristram, for the good lordship ye showed me in Ireland, and for my lady your daughter's sake, La Beale Isoud, I will take the battle for you upon this condition that ye shall grant me two things: that one is that ye shall swear to me that ye are in the right, that ye were never consenting to the knight's death; Sir, then said Sir Tristram, when that I have done this battle, if God give me grace that I speed, that ye shall give me a reward, what thing reasonable that I will ask of you.
<p/>How so, my good lord? said Sir Tristram. So God me help, said the king, ye shall have whatsomever ye will ask.
<p/>It is well said, said Sir Tristram. CHAPTER XXII. How Sir Tristram fought for Sir Anguish and overcame his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) adversary, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) adversary would never yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>NOW make your answer that your champion is ready, for I shall die in your quarrel rather than to be recreant.
<p/>I have no doubt of you, said the king, that, an ye should have ado with Sir Launcelot du Lake-- Sir, said Sir Tristram, as for Sir Launcelot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is called the noblest knight of the world, and wit ye well that the knights of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) blood are noble men, and dread shame; and as for Bleoberis, brother unto Sir Blamore, I have done battle with him (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>), therefore upon my head it is no shame to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>) a good knight.
<p/>Sir, as for that let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall never be refused, an as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) were the best knight that now beareth shield or spear.
<p/>So King Anguish departed unto King Carados and the kings that were that time as judges, and told them that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had found his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) champion ready.
<p/>Then by the commandment of the kings Sir Blamore de Ganis and Sir Tristram were sent for to hear the charge.
<p/>And when they were come before the judges there were many kings and knights beheld Sir Tristram, and much speech they had of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) because that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) slew Sir Marhaus, the good knight, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) for-jousted Sir Palamides the good knight.
<p/>It is noised, said the king, that Blamore is the hardier knight. So when they had taken their charge they withdrew them to make them ready to do battle.
<p/>Fair dear brother, remember of what kin we be come of, and what a man is Sir Launcelot du Lake, neither farther nor nearer but brother's children, and there was never none of our kin that ever was shamed in battle; and rather suffer death, brother, than to be shamed.
<p/>Brother, said Blamore, have ye no doubt of me, for I shall never shame none of my blood; howbeit I am sure that yonder knight is called a passing good knight as of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) time one of the world, yet shall I never yield me, nor say the loath word: well may he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) happen to smite me down with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) great might of chivalry, but rather shall he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slay me than I shall yield me as recreant.
<p/>God speed you well, said Sir Bleoberis, for ye shall find him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) the mightiest knight that ever ye had ado withal, for I know him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), for I have had ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>God me speed, said Sir Blamore de Ganis; and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Ganis</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Ganis</b></font>) horse at the one end of the lists, and Sir Tristram at the other end of the lists, and
<p/>so they feutred their spears and came together as it had been thunder; and there Sir Tristram through great might smote down Sir Blamore and his (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>) horse to the earth.
<p/>Then anon Sir Blamore avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>) horse and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>) sword and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>) shield afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>), and bade Sir Tristram alight:
<p/>Then said Sir Bleoberis unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) brother, Sir Blamore: For though an horse hath failed me, I trust to God the earth will not fail me.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram alighted, and dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) unto battle; and there they lashed together strongly as racing and tracing, foining and dashing, many sad strokes, that the kings and knights had great wonder that they might stand; for ever they fought like wood men, so that there was never knights seen fight more fiercely than they did; for Sir Blamore was so hasty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>) would have no rest, that all men wondered that they had breath to stand on their feet; and all the place was bloody that they fought in.
<p/>And at the last, Sir Tristram smote Sir Blamore such a buffet upon the helm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>) there fell down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>) side, and Sir Tristram stood and beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Blamore desired Tristram to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>), and how Sir Tristram spared him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and how they took appointment.
<p/>THEN when Sir Blamore might speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blamore</b></font>) said thus: Sir Tristram de Liones, I require thee, as thou art a noble knight, and the best knight that ever I found, that thou wilt slay me out, for I would not live to be made lord of all the earth, for I have liefer die with worship than live with shame; and needs, Sir Tristram, thou must slay me, or else thou shalt never win the field, for I will never say the loath word.
<p/>When Sir Tristram heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) say so knightly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wist not what to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) remembering him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) of both parties, of what blood he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was come, and for Sir Launcelot's sake he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would be loath to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and in the other party in no wise he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might not choose, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) must make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to say the loath word, or else to slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>Then Sir Tristram stert aback, and went to the kings that were judges, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) kneeled down to-fore them, and besought them for their worships, and for King Arthur's and Sir Launcelot's sake, that they would take this matter in their hands.
<p/>For, my fair lords, said Sir Tristram, it were shame and pity that this noble knight that yonder lieth should be slain; for ye hear well, shamed will he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) not be,
<p/>And therefore if thou dare slay me, slay me, I require thee. and I pray to God that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) never be slain nor shamed for me.
<p/>And as for the king for whom I fight for, I shall require him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), as I am his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) true champion and true knight in this field, that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will have mercy upon this good knight.
<p/>So God me help, said King Anguish, I will for your sake; Sir Tristram, be ruled as ye will have me, for I know you for my true knight; and therefore I will heartily pray the kings that be here as judges to take it in their hands.
<p/>My lords, said Bleoberis, though my brother be beaten, and hath the worse through might of arms, I dare say, though Sir Tristram hath beaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) body he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hath not beaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) heart, and I thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is not shamed this day; and rather than he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should be shamed
<p/>And the kings that were judges called Sir Bleoberis to them, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) advice. I require you, said Bleoberis, let Sir Tristram slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) out.
<p/>It shall not be so, said the kings, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) part adversary, both the king and the champion, have pity of Sir Blamore's knighthood.
<p/>My lords, said Bleoberis, I will right well as ye will. Then the kings called the King of Ireland, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) goodly and treatable.
<p/>And then, by all their advices, Sir Tristram and Sir Bleoberis took up Sir Blamore, and the two brethren were accorded with King Anguish, and kissed and made friends for ever.
<p/>And then Sir Blamore and Sir Tristram kissed together, and there they made their oaths that they would never none of them two brethren fight with Sir Tristram, and Sir Tristram made the same oath.
<p/>And for that gentle battle all the blood of Sir Launcelot loved Sir Tristram for ever. Then King Anguish and Sir Tristram took their leave, and sailed into Ireland with great noblesse and joy.
<p/>So when they were in Ireland the king let make it known throughout all the land how and in what manner Sir Tristram had done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>But the joy that La Beale Isoud made of Sir Tristram there might no tongue tell, for of all men earthly she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) most.
<p/>Then the queen and all that there were made the most of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that they might. CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram demanded La Beale Isoud for King Mark, and how Sir Tristram and Isoud drank the love drink.
<p/>THEN upon a day King Anguish asked Sir Tristram why he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) asked not his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) boon, for whatsomever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should have it without fail.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Tristram, now is it time; this is all that I will desire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud, your daughter, not for myself, but for mine uncle, King Mark, that shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) to wife, for so have I promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>Alas, said the king, I had liefer than all the land that I have ye would wed her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) yourself. Sir, an
<p/>Therefore, said Sir I Tristram, I pray you hold your promise that ye promised me; for this is my desire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud to go with me into Cornwall for to be wedded to King Mark, mine uncle.
<p/>I did then I were shamed for ever in this world, and false of my promise. As for that, said King Anguish, ye shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) with you to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) what it please you
<p/>yourself, that is me liefest, and if ye will give her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) unto King Mark, your uncle, that is in your choice.
<p/>So, to make short conclusion, La Beale Isoud was made ready to go with Sir Tristram, and Dame Bragwaine went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) chief gentlewoman, with many other.
<p/>Then the queen, Isoud's mother, gave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) and Dame Bragwaine, her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) daughter's gentlewoman, and unto Gouvernail, a drink, and charged them that what day King Mark should wed, that same day they should give him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) that drink, so that King Mark should drink to La Beale Isoud, and then, said the queen, I undertake either shall love other the days of their life.
<p/>; that is for to say if that ye list to we d her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) So this drink was given unto Dame Bragwaine, and unto Gouvernail.
<p/>And then anon Sir Tristram took the sea, and La Beale Isoud; and when they were in their cabin, it happed so that they were thirsty, and they saw a little flasket of gold stand by them, and it seemed by the colour and the taste that it was noble wine.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram took the flasket in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, and said, Madam Isoud, here is the best drink that ever ye drank, that Dame Bragwaine, your maiden, and Gouvernail, my servant, have kept for themselves.
<p/>Then they laughed and made good cheer, and either drank to other freely, and they thought never drink that ever they drank to other was so sweet nor so good.
<p/>But by that their drink was in their bodies, they loved either other so well that never their love departed for weal neither for woe.
<p/>And thus it happed the love first betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, the which love never departed the days of their life.
<p/>they came nigh a castle that hight Pluere, and thereby arrived for to repose them, weening to them to have had good harbourage.
<p/>But anon as Sir Tristram was within the castle they were taken prisoners; for the custom of the castle was such; who that rode by that castle and brought any lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) must needs fight with the lord, that hight Breunor.
<p/>And if it were so that Breunor won the field, then should the knight stranger and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady be put to death, what that ever they were; and if it were so that the strange knight won the field of Sir Breunor, then should he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) die and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady both.
<p/>So then they sailed till by fortune This custom was used many winters, for it was called the Castle Pluere, that is to say the Weeping Castle.
<p/>How Sir Tristram and Isoud were in prison, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fought for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty, and smote of another lady's head.
<p/>CHAPTER XXV. THUS as Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in prison , it happed a knight and a lady came unto them where they were, to cheer them.
<p/>I have marvel, said Tristram unto the knight and the lady, what is the cause the lord of this castle holdeth us in prison
<p/>: it was never the custom of no place of worship that ever I came in, when a knight and a lady asked harbour, and they to receive them, and after to destroy them that be his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) guests.
<p/>Sir, said the knight, this is the old custom of this castle, that when a knight cometh here he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) must needs fight with our lord, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that is weaker must lose his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head.
<p/>And when that is done, if his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bringeth be fouler than our lord's wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must lose her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head: and if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) be fairer proved than is our lady, then shall the lady of this castle lose her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head.
<p/>So God me help, said Sir Tristram, this is a foul custom and a shameful. But one advantage have I, said Sir Tristram, I have a lady is fair enough,
<p/>fairer saw I never in all my life-days, and I doubt not for lack of beauty she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shall not lose her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head; and rather than I should lose my head
<p/>Wherefore, sir knight, I pray you tell your lord that I will be ready as to-morn with my lady, and myself to do battle, if it be so
<p/>I will fight for it on a fair field. I may have my horse and mine armour. Sir, said that knight, I undertake that your desire shall be sped right well.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said: Take your rest, and look that ye be up betimes and make you ready and your lady, for ye shall want no thing that you behoveth.
<p/>And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) departed, and on the morn betimes that same knight came to Sir Tristram, and fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) out and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and armour that was his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) make him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ready to the field, for all the estates and commons of that lordship were there ready to behold that battle and judgment.
<p/>Then came Sir Breunor, the lord of that castle, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lady in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) hand, muffled, and asked Sir Tristram where was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady: For an thy lady be fairer than mine, with thy sword smite off my lady's head; and if my lady be fairer than thine, with my sword I must strike off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head.
<p/>And if I may win thee, yet shall thy lady be mine, and thou shalt lose thy head. Sir, said Tristram, this is a foul custom and horrible; and rather than my lady should lose her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, yet
<p/>had I liefer lose my head. Nay, nay, said Sir Breunor, the ladies shall be first showed together, and the one shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Breunor</b></font>) judgment.
<p/>But I doubt not, said Sir Tristram, my lady is fairer than thine, and that will I prove and make good with my hand.
<p/>Nay, I will not so, said Sir Tristram, for here is none that will give righteous judgment. And whosomever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) be that will say the contrary I will prove it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head.
<p/>And therewith Sir Tristram showed La Beale Isoud, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) thrice about with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) naked sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand. And when Sir Breunor saw that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did the same wise turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady.
<p/>But when Sir Breunor beheld La Beale Isoud, him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw never a fairer lady, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) dread his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady's head should be off.
<p/>And so all the people that were there present gave judgment that La Beale Isoud was the fairer lady and the better made.
<p/>How now, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were pity that my lady should lose her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, but because thou and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of long time have used this wicked custom, and by you both have many good knights and ladies been destroyed, for that cause it were no loss to destroy you both.
<p/>So God me help, said Sir Breunor, for to say the sooth, thy lady is fairer than mine, and that me sore repenteth.
<p/>And so I hear the people privily say, for of all women I saw none so fair; and therefore, an thou wilt slay my lady, I doubt
<p/>not but I shall slay thee and have thy lady. Thou shalt win her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), said Sir Tristram, as dear as ever knight won lady.
<p/>And because of thine own judgment, as thou wouldst have done to my lady if that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been fouler, and because of the evil custom, give me thy lady, said Sir Tristram.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Tristram strode unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and with an awk stroke he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head clean.
<p/>Well, knight, said Sir Breunor, now hast thou done me a despite; -LSB-*8-RSB-now take thine horse: sithen I am ladyless I will win thy lady an
<p/>I may. -LSB-*8-RSB- Printed by Caxton as part of chap. xxvi. CHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Breunor, and at the last smote off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head.
<p/>THEN they took their horses and came together as it had been the thunder; and Sir Tristram smote Sir Breunor clean from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rose up; and as Sir Tristram came again by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse throughout both the shoulders, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse hurled here and there and fell dead to the ground.
<p/>And ever Sir Breunor ran after to have slain Sir Tristram, but Sir Tristram was light and nimble, and voided his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse lightly.
<p/>And or ever Sir Tristram might dress his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword the other gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) three or four sad strokes.
<p/>For this Sir Breunor was a proved knight, and had been or then the death of many good knights, that it was pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had so long endured.
<p/>Then they rushed together like two boars, tracing and traversing mightily and wisely as two noble knights. Thus they fought, hurling here and there nigh two hours, and either were wounded sore.
<p/>Then at the last Sir Breunor rashed upon Sir Tristram and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) arms, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) trusted much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) strength.
<p/>Then was Sir Tristram called the strongest and the highest knight of the world; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was called bigger than Sir Launcelot, but Sir Launcelot was better breathed.
<p/>And then all they that longed to the castle came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and did him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) homage and fealty, praying him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would abide there still a little while to fordo that foul custom.
<p/>So anon Sir Tristram thrust Sir Breunor down grovelling, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) helm and struck off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head. Sir Tristram granted thereto.
<p/>The meanwhile one of the knights of the castle rode unto Sir Galahad, the haut prince, the which was Sir Breunor's son, which was a noble knight, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) what misadventure his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) father had and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mother.
<p/>CHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Galahad fought with Sir Tristram, and how Sir Tristram yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and promised to fellowship with Launcelot.
<p/>THEN came Sir Galahad, and the King with the Hundred Knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and this Sir Galahad proffered to fight with Sir Tristram hand for hand.
<p/>Then Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram met together so hard that either bare other down, horse and all, to the earth.
<p/>And then they avoided their horses as noble knights, and dressed their shields, and drew their swords with ire and rancour, and they lashed together many sad strokes, and one
<p/>while striking, another while foining, tracing and traversing as noble knights; thus they fought long, near half a day, and either were sore wounded.
<p/>At the last Sir Tristram waxed light and big, and doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) strokes, and drove Sir Galahad aback on the one side and on the other, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was like to have been slain.
<p/>And so they made them ready to go unto battle on horseback with great courage. With that came the King with the Hundred Knights, and all that fellowship went fiercely upon Sir Tristram.
<p/>When Sir Tristram saw them coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wist well he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might not endure. Then as a wise knight of war, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said to Sir Galahad, the haut prince:
<p/>Sir, ye show to me no knighthood, for to suffer all your men to have ado with me all at once; and as meseemeth ye be a noble knight of your hands it is great shame to you.
<p/>So God me help, said Sir Galahad, there is none other way but thou must yield thee to me, other else to die, said Sir Galahad to Sir Tristram.
<p/>I will rather yield me to you than die for that is more for the might of your men than of your hands.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) own sword by the point, and put the pommel in the hand of Sir Galahad.
<p/>Let be, said Sir Galahad, be ye not so hardy to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), for I have given this knight his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) life.
<p/>Therewithal came the King with the Hundred Knights, and hard began to assail Sir Tristram. That is your shame, said the King with the Hundred Knights; hath he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) not slain your father and your mother?
<p/>As for that, said Sir Galahad, I may not wite him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) greatly, for my father had him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in prison, and enforced him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to do battle with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and my father had such a custom that was a shameful custom, that what knight came there to ask harbour his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady must needs die
<p/>but if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were fairer than my mother; and if my father overcame that knight he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must needs die. This was a shameful custom and usage, a knight for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) harbour-asking to have such harbourage.
<p/>And for this custom I would never draw about him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). So God me help, said the King, this was a shameful custom.
<p/>Truly, said Sir Galahad, so seemed me; and meseemed it had been great pity that this knight should have been slain, for I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is the noblest man that beareth life, but if it were Sir Launcelot du Lake.
<p/>Now, fair knight, said Sir Galahad, I require thee tell me thy name, and of whence thou art, and whither thou wilt.
<p/>I was sent on message unto King Anguish of Ireland, for to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) daughter to be his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wife, and here she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is ready to go with me into Cornwall, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) name is La Beale Isoud.
<p/>And, Sir Tristram, said Sir Galahad, the haut prince, well be ye found in these marches, and so ye will promise me to go unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, and accompany with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), ye shall go where ye will, and your fair lady with you; and
<p/>I shall promise you never in all my days shall such customs be used in this castle as have been used.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and from King Mark of Cornwall Sir, said Sir Tristram, now I let you wit, so God me help
<p/>, I weened ye had been Sir Launcelot du Lake when I saw you first, and therefore I dread you the more; and sir, I promise you, said Sir Tristram, as soon as I may I will see Sir Launcelot and in fellowship me with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); for of all the knights of the world I most desire his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellowship.
<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Launcelot met with Sir Carados bearing away Sir Gawaine, and of the rescue of Sir Gawaine. AND then Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leave when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) time, and took the sea.
<p/>And in the meanwhile word came unto Sir Launcelot and to Sir Tristram that Sir Carados, the mighty king, that was made like a giant, fought with Sir Gawaine, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) such strokes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) swooned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) saddle, and after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) by the collar and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) saddle, and fast bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) to the saddle-bow, and so rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) way with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) castle.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) rode, by fortune Sir Launcelot met with Sir Carados, and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) knew Sir Gawaine that lay bound after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>).
<p/>Ah, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine, how stands it with you? Never so hard, said Sir Gawaine, unless that ye help me, for so God me help, without ye rescue me
<p/>I know no knight that may, but outher you or Sir Tristram. Wherefore Sir Launcelot was heavy of Sir Gawaine's words.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot bade Sir Carados: Lay down that knight and fight with me. Thou art but a fool, said Sir Carados, for I will serve you in the same wise.
<p/>As for that, said Sir Launcelot, spare me not, for I warn thee I will not spare thee. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) bound Sir Gawaine hand and foot, and so threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) to the ground.
<p/>And so either met with other, and brake their spears to their hands; and then they pulled out swords, and hurtled together on horseback more than an hour.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) spear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) squire, and departed from Sir Launcelot to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) course. And at the last Sir Launcelot smote Sir Carados such a buffet upon the helm that it pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) brain-pan.
<p/>So then Sir Launcelot took Sir Carados by the collar and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) horse's feet, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) alighted and pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) helm and struck off his (<font color='blue'><b>Carados</b></font>) head.
<p/>So this same tale was told to Sir Galahad and to Sir Tristram:--here may ye hear the nobleness that followeth Sir Launcelot.
<p/>I had not this message in hand with this fair lady, truly I would never stint or I had found Sir Launcelot.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud went to the sea and came into Cornwall, and there all the barons met them.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot unbound Sir Gawaine. Alas, said Sir Tristram, an CHAPTER XXIX. Of the wedding of King Mark to La Beale Isoud, and of Bragwaine her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) maid, and of Palamides.
<p/>AND anon they were richly wedded with great noblesse. But ever, as the French book saith, Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud loved ever together.
<p/>Then was there great jousts and great tourneying, and many lords and ladies were at that feast, and Sir Tristram was most praised of all other.
<p/>Thus dured the feast long, and after the feast was done, within a little while after, by the assent of two ladies that were with Queen Isoud, they ordained for hate and envy for to destroy Dame Bragwaine, that was maiden and lady unto La Beale Isoud; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) was sent into the forest for to fetch herbs, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) was met, and bound feet and hand to a tree,
<p/>And by fortune, Sir Palamides found Dame Bragwaine, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) from the death, and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) to a nunnery there beside, for to be recovered.
<p/>and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) was bounden three days. When Isoud the queen missed her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) maiden, wit ye well she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was right heavy as ever was any queen, for of all earthly women she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) best:
<p/>And so upon a day Queen Isoud walked into the forest to put away her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) thoughts, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) went herself unto a well and made great moan.
<p/>And suddenly there came Palamides to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>), and had heard all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) complaint, and said: Madam Isoud, an ye will grant me my boon, I shall bring to you Dame Bragwaine safe and sound.
<p/>the cause was for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) came with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) country. And the queen was so glad of his (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) proffer that suddenly unadvised she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) granted all his (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) asking.
<p/>Well, Madam, said Palamides, I trust to your promise, and if ye will abide here half an hour I shall bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Madam</b></font>) to you.
<p/>And Sir Palamides rode forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) way to that nunnery, and lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) came again with Dame Bragwaine; but by her (<font color='blue'><b>Madam</b></font>) good will she (<font color='blue'><b>Madam</b></font>) would not have come again, because for love of the queen she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) stood in adventure of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) life.
<p/>I shall abide you, said La Beale Isoud. Notwithstanding, half against her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) went with Sir Palamides unto the queen.
<p/>And when the queen saw her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was passing glad. Now, Madam, said Palamides, remember upon your promise, for I have fulfilled my promise.
<p/>Sir Palamides, said the queen, I wot not what is your desire, but I will that ye wit, howbeit I promised you largely, I thought none evil, nor I warn you none evil will I do.
<p/>Madam, said Sir Palamides, as at this time, ye shall not know my desire, but before my lord your husband there shall ye know that I will have my desire that ye have promised me.
<p/>And when Sir Palamides came before the king, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said: Sir King, I require you as ye be a righteous king, that ye will judge me the right.
<p/>And therewith the queen departed, and rode home to the king, and Sir Palamides rode after her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>). Tell me your cause, said the king, and ye shall have right.
<p/>CHAPTER XXX. How Palamides demanded Queen Isoud, and how Lambegus rode after to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>), and of the escape of Isoud.
<p/>SIR, said Palamides, I promised your Queen Isoud to bring again Dame Bragwaine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) had lost, upon this covenant, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) should grant me a boon that I would ask, and without grudging, outher advisement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) granted me.
<p/>It is as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) saith, so God me help, said the queen; to say thee sooth I promised him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) asking for love and joy that I had to see her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>).
<p/>Well, Madam, said the king, and if ye were hasty to grant him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) what boon he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would ask, I will well that
<p/>Then, said Palamides, I will that ye wit that I will have your queen to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) and govern her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) whereas me list.
<p/>What say ye, my lady? said the king. ye perform your promise. Therewith the king stood still, and bethought him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of Sir Tristram, and deemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>).
<p/>And then hastily the king answered: Take her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) with the adventures that shall fall of it, for as I suppose thou wilt not enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) no while.
<p/>And so, to make short tale, Sir Palamides took her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) by the hand and said: Madam, grudge not to go with me, for I desire nothing but your own promise.
<p/>As for that, said the queen, I fear not greatly to go with thee, howbeit thou hast me at advantage upon my promise, for I doubt not I shall be worshipfully rescued from thee.
<p/>As for that, said Palamides, I dare right well abide the adventure. As for that, said Sir Palamides, be it as it be may.
<p/>Anon the king sent after Sir Tristram, but in no wise he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) could be found, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was in the forest a-hunting; for that was always his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) custom, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) used arms, to chase and to hunt in the forests.
<p/>Alas, said the king, now I am shamed for ever, that by mine own assent my lady and my queen shall be devoured.
<p/>So Queen Isoud was set behind Palamides, and rode his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) way. Then came forth a knight, his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) name was Lambegus, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was a knight of Sir Tristram.
<p/>My lord, said this knight, sith ye have trust in my lord, Sir Tristram, wit ye well for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sake I will ride after your queen and rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), or else I shall be beaten.
<p/>Gramercy, said the king, as I live, Sir Lambegus, I shall deserve it. And then Sir Lambegus armed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and rode after as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might.
<p/>And then within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) overtook Sir Palamides. And then Sir Palamides left the queen. What art thou, said Palamides, art thou Tristram?
<p/>Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said, I am his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) servant, and my name is Sir Lambegus. That me repenteth, said Palamides. I had liefer thou hadst been Sir Tristram.
<p/>And then they hurtled together and all to-brast their spears, and then they pulled out their swords, and hewed on helms and hauberks.
<p/>At the last Sir Palamides gave Sir Lambegus such a wound that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fell down like a dead knight to the earth.
<p/>I believe you well, said Lambegus, but when thou meetest with Sir Tristram thou shalt have thy hands full. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) looked after La Beale Isoud, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) was gone
<p/>So the queen ran into the forest, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) found a well, and therein she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) had thought to have drowned herself.
<p/>And as good fortune would, there came a knight to her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) that had a castle thereby, his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name was Sir Adtherp.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) nist where. Wit ye well Sir Palamides was never so heavy. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) found the queen in that mischief he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rescued her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) castle.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wist what she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) armed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would be avenged upon Palamides; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode on till he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) met with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and there Sir Palamides wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sore, and by force he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) the cause why he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did battle with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and how he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had led the queen unto his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) castle.
<p/>Now bring me there, said Palamides, or thou shalt die of my hands. Sir, said Sir Adtherp, I am so wounded I may not follow, but ride you this way
<p/>and it shall bring you into my castle, and there within is the queen. Then Sir Palamides rode still till he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came to the castle.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might not come within the castle, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) put off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bridle and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saddle, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse to pasture, and set himself down at the gate like a man that was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wit that recked not of himself.
<p/>And at a window La Beale Isoud saw Sir Palamides; then she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) made the gates to be shut strongly. CHAPTER XXXI.
<p/>How Sir Tristram rode after Palamides, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and fought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and by the means of Isoud the battle ceased.
<p/>NOW turn we unto Sir Tristram, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was come home and wist La Beale Isoud was gone with Sir Palamides, wit ye well he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was wroth out of measure.
<p/>Alas, said Sir Tristram, I am this day shamed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) cried to Gouvernail his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) man: Haste thee that I were armed and on horseback,
<p/>for well I wot Lambegus hath no might nor strength to withstand Sir Palamides: alas that I have not been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) stead!
<p/>So anon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was armed and horsed Sir Tristram and Gouvernail rode after into the forest, and within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knight Lambegus almost wounded to the death; and Sir Tristram bare him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to a forester, and charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode forth, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found Sir Adtherp sore wounded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) how the queen would have drowned herself had he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) not been, and how for her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) sake and love he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had taken upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to do battle with Sir Palamides.
<p/>Where is my lady? said Sir Tristram. Sir, said the knight, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is sure enough within my castle, an she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can hold her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) within it.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came nigh to that castle; and then Sir Tristram saw where Sir Palamides sat at the gate sleeping, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse pastured fast afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>Gramercy, said Sir Tristram, of thy great goodness. Now go thou, Gouvernail, said Sir Tristram, and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) awake, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ready.
<p/>So Gouvernail rode unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and said: Sir Palamides, arise, and take to thee thine harness. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was in such a study he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) heard not what Gouvernail said.
<p/>So Gouvernail came again and told Sir Tristram he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) slept, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was mad. Go thou again, said Sir Tristram, and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) arise, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that I am here, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) mortal foe.
<p/>So Gouvernail rode again and put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the butt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear, and said: Sir Palamides, make thee ready, for wit ye well Sir Tristram hoveth yonder, and sendeth thee word he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is thy mortal foe.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Palamides arose stilly, without words, and gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and saddled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and bridled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leapt upon, and gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, and either feutred their spears and hurtled fast together; and there Tristram smote down Sir Palamides over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse's tail.
<p/>And there began strong battle on both parts, for both they fought for the love of one lady, and ever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lay on the walls and beheld them how they fought out of measure, and either were wounded passing sore, but Palamides was much sorer wounded.
<p/>Then lightly Sir Palamides put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword. Thus they fought tracing and traversing more than two hours, that well-nigh for dole and sorrow La Beale Isoud swooned.
<p/>Alas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) said, that one I loved and yet do, and the other I love not, yet it were great pity that I should see Sir Palamides slain; for well I know by that time the end be done Sir Palamides is but a dead knight: because he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is not christened I would be loath that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should die a Saracen.
<p/>And therewithal she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) came down and besought Sir Tristram to fight no more. Ah, madam, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), what mean you, will ye have me shamed?
<p/>I will not your dishonour, said La Beale Isoud, but I would that ye would for my sake spare this unhappy Saracen Palamides.
<p/>Well ye know I will be ruled by you. Madam, said Sir Tristram, I will leave fighting at this time for your sake.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) said to Sir Palamides: This shall be your charge, that thou shalt go out of this country while I am therein.
<p/>Then take thy way, said La Beale Isoud, unto the court of King Arthur, and there recommend me unto Queen Guenever, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) that I send her (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) word that there be within this land but four lovers, that is, Sir Launcelot du Lake and Queen Guenever, and Sir Tristram de Liones and Queen Isoud.
<p/>I will obey your commandment, said Sir Palamides, the which is sore against my will. CHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Tristram brought Queen Isoud home, and of the debate of King Mark and Sir Tristram.
<p/>And Sir Tristram took the queen and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) again to King Mark, and then was there made great joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) home-coming.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram let fetch Sir Lambegus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knight, from the forester's house, and it was long or he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was whole, but at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was well recovered.
<p/>AND so Sir Palamides departed with great heaviness. Who was cherished but Sir Tristram! Thus they lived with joy and play a long while.
<p/>But ever Sir Andred, that was nigh cousin to Sir Tristram, lay in a watch to wait betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, for to take them and slander them.
<p/>So upon a day Sir Tristram talked with La Beale Isoud in a window, and that espied Sir Andred, and told it to the King.
<p/>Then King Mark took a sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) hand and came to Sir Tristram, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) false traitor, and would have stricken him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>But Sir Tristram was nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and ran under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword, and took it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand. And then the King cried:
<p/>Where are my knights and my men? I charge you slay this traitor. But at that time there was not one would move for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) words.
<p/>When Sir Tristram saw that there was not one would be against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shook the sword to the king, and made countenance as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would have stricken him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And then King Mark fled, and Sir Tristram followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and smote upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) five or six strokes flatling on the neck, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to fall upon the nose.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram yede his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) man, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode into that forest.
<p/>And there upon a day Sir Tristram met with two brethren that were knights with King Mark, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) struck off the head of the one, and wounded the other to the death; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) brother's head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) helm unto the king, and thirty more there he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wounded.
<p/>And when that knight came before the king to say his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) message, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) there died afore the king and the queen.
<p/>Then King Mark called his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) council unto him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and asked advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) barons what was best to do with Sir Tristram.
<p/>Sir, said the barons, in especial Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, Sir, we will give you counsel for to send for Sir Tristram, for we will that ye wit many men will hold with Sir Tristram
<p/>And sir, said Sir Dinas, ye shall understand that Sir Tristram is called peerless and makeless of any Christian knight, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might and hardiness we knew none so good a knight, but if it be Sir Launcelot du Lake.
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) depart from your court and go to King Arthur's court, wit ye well he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will get him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) such friends there that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will not set by your malice.
<p/>an he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) were hard bestead. And therefore, sir, I counsel you to take him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to your grace. I will well, said the king, that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) be sent for, that we may be friends.
<p/>And so when Sir Tristram came to the king he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was welcome, and no rehearsal was made, and there was game and play.
<p/>Then the barons sent for Sir Tristram under a safe conduct. And then the king and the queen went a-hunting, and Sir Tristram.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Lamorak jousted with thirty knights, and Sir Tristram at the request of King Mark smote his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse down.
<p/>THE king and the queen made their pavilions and their tents in that forest beside a river, and there was daily hunting and jousting, for there were ever thirty knights ready to joust unto all them that came in at that time.
<p/>And there by fortune came Sir Lamorak de Galis and Sir Driant; and there Sir Driant jousted right well, but at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) had a fall.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) began he (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) fared so with the thirty knights that there was not one of them but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) a fall, and some of them were sore hurt.
<p/>Then Sir Lamorak proffered to joust. I marvel, said King Mark, what knight he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) is that doth such deeds of arms.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Tristram, I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well for a noble knight as few now be living, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name is Sir Lamorak de Galis.
<p/>It were great shame, said the king, that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) should go thus away, unless that some of you meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) better.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were no worship for a noble man to have ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>): and for because at this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hath done over much for any mean knight living, therefore, as meseemeth, it were great shame and villainy to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) any more at this time, insomuch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse are weary both; for the deeds of arms that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hath done this day, an they be well considered, it were enough for Sir Launcelot du Lake.
<p/>As for that, said King Mark, I require you, as ye love me and my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud, take your arms and joust with Sir Lamorak de Galis.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Tristram, ye bid me do a thing that is against knighthood, and well I can deem that I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a fall, for it is no mastery, for my horse
<p/>and I be fresh both, and so is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and wit ye well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) will take it for great unkindness, for
<p/>ever one good knight is loath to take another at disadvantage; but because I will not displease you, as ye require me so will I do, and obey your commandment.
<p/>And so Sir Tristram armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) forth, and there Sir Lamorak met him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) mightily, and what with the might of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) own spear, and of Sir Tristram's spear, Sir Lamorak's horse fell to the earth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) sitting in the saddle.
<p/>Then anon as lightly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) might he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) avoided the saddle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) horse, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) shield afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) sword.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Tristram, I will no more have ado with thee, for I have done to thee over much unto my dishonour and to thy worship.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bade Sir Tristram: Alight, thou knight, an thou durst. As for that, said Sir Lamorak, I can thee no thank; since thou hast for-jousted me on horseback
<p/>I require thee and I beseech thee, an thou be Sir Tristram, fight with me on foot. I will not so, said Sir Tristram; and wit ye
<p/>well my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and well I know ye be Sir Lamorak de Galis, and this that I have done to you was against my will, but I was required thereto; but to say that I will do at your request as at this time, I will have no more ado with you, for me shameth of that I have done.
<p/>As for the shame, said Sir Lamorak, on thy part or on mine, bear thou it an thou wilt, for though a mare's son hath failed me, now a queen's son shall not fail thee; and therefore, an thou be such a knight as men call thee
<p/>Sir Lamorak, said Sir Tristram, I understand your heart is great, and cause why ye have, to say thee sooth; for it would grieve me an any knight should keep him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fresh and then to strike down a weary knight, for that knight nor horse was never formed that alway might stand or endure.
<p/>, I require thee, alight, and fight with me. And therefore, said Sir Tristram, I will not have ado with you, for me forthinketh of that I have done.
<p/>How Sir Lamorak sent an horn to King Mark in despite of Sir Tristram, and how Sir Tristram was driven into a chapel.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) departed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) with Sir Driant, and by the way they met with a knight that was sent from Morgan le Fay unto King Arthur; and this knight had a fair horn harnessed with gold, and the horn had such a virtue that there might no lady nor gentlewoman drink of that horn
<p/>but if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were true to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were false she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should spill all the drink, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were true to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might drink peaceable.
<p/>And because of the Queen Guenever, and in the despite of Sir Launcelot, this horn was sent unto King Arthur; and by force Sir Lamorak made that knight to tell all the cause why he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) bare that horn.
<p/>As for that, said Sir Lamorak, I shall quit you, an ever I see my time. CHAPTER XXXIV. Now shalt thou bear this horn, said Lamorak, unto King Mark, or else choose thou to die for it;
<p/>for I tell thee plainly, in despite and reproof of Sir Tristram thou shalt bear that horn unto King Mark, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) uncle, and say thou to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) that I sent it him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) for to assay his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) lady, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) be true to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) shall prove her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>So the knight went his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) way unto King Mark, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that rich horn, and said that Sir Lamorak sent it him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), and thereto he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) the virtue of that horn.
<p/>Then the king made Queen Isoud to drink thereof, and an hundred ladies, and there were but four ladies of all those that drank clean.
<p/>Alas, said King Mark, this is a great despite, and sware a great oath that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) should be burnt and the other ladies.
<p/>Then the barons gathered them together, and said plainly they would not have those ladies burnt for an horn made by sorcery, that came from as false a sorceress and witch as then was living.
<p/>For that horn did never good, but caused strife and debate, and always in her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) days she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) had been an enemy to all true lovers.
<p/>So there were many knights made their avow , an ever they met with Morgan le Fay, that they would show her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) short courtesy.
<p/>Also Sir Tristram was passing wroth that Sir Lamorak sent that horn unto King Mark, for well he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) knew that it was done in the despite of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>Then Sir Tristram used daily and nightly to go to Queen Isoud when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might, and ever Sir Andred his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) cousin watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) night and day for to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) with La Beale Isoud.
<p/>And therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thought to quite Sir Lamorak. And so upon a night Sir Andred espied the hour and the time when Sir Tristram went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady.
<p/>Then Sir Andred gat unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) twelve knights, and at midnight he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) set upon Sir Tristram secretly and suddenly and there Sir Tristram was taken naked abed with La Beale Isoud, and then was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bound hand and foot, and
<p/>And then by the assent of King Mark, and of Sir Andred, and of some of the barons, Sir Tristram was led unto a chapel that stood upon the sea rocks, there for to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) judgment: and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was led bounden with forty knights.
<p/>And when Sir Tristram saw that there was none other boot but needs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) must die, then said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>): Fair lords, remember what I have done for the country of Cornwall, and in what jeopardy I have been in for the weal of you all; for when I fought for the truage of Cornwall with Sir Marhaus, the good knight, I was promised for to be better rewarded, when ye all refused to take the battle; therefore, as ye be good gentle knights, see me not thus shamefully to die, for it is shame to all knighthood thus to see me die; for I dare say, said Sir Tristram, that I never met with no knight
<p/>Fie upon thee, said Sir Andred, false traitor that thou art, with thine avaunting; for all thy boast thou shalt die this day.
<p/>O Andred, Andred, said Sir Tristram, thou shouldst be my kinsman, and now thou art to me full unfriendly, but an there were no more but thou
<p/>so was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) kept until day. but I was as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), or better. and I , thou wouldst not put me to death.
<p/>When Sir Tristram saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) make such countenance he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) looked upon both his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hands that were fast bounden unto two knights, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) pulled them both to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and unwrast his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hands, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leapt unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) cousin, Sir Andred, and wrested his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hands; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote Sir Andred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell to the earth, and so Sir Tristram fought till that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had killed ten knights.
<p/>No! said Sir Andred, and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword, and would have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). So then Sir Tristram gat the chapel and kept it mightily.
<p/>When Sir Tristram saw the people draw unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) remembered he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was naked, and sperd fast the chapel door, and brake the bars of a window, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leapt out and fell upon the crags in the sea.
<p/>Then the cry was great, and the people drew fast unto Sir Andred, mo than an hundred. And so at that time Sir Andred nor none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellows might get to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), at that time.
<p/>How Sir Tristram was holpen by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) men, and of Queen Isoud which was put in a lazar-cote, and how Tristram was hurt.
<p/>SO when they were departed, Gouvernail, and Sir Lambegus, and Sir Sentraille de Lushon, that were Sir Tristram's men, sought their master.
<p/>When they heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was escaped then they were passing glad; and on the rocks they found him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and with towels they pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) up.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram asked them where was La Beale Isoud, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) weened she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) had been had away of Andred's people.
<p/>Alas, said Sir Tristram, this is a full ungoodly place for such a fair lady, and if I may she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shall not be long there.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) men and went thereas was La Beale Isoud, and fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) away, and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) into a forest to a fair manor, and Sir Tristram there abode with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>).
<p/>CHAPTER XXXV. Sir, said Gouvernail, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) is put in a lazar-cote. So the good knight bade his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) men go from him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>): For at this time I may not help you.
<p/>And so upon a day Sir Tristram yede into the forest for to disport him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and then it happened that there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell sleep; and there came a man that Sir Tristram aforehand had slain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother, and when this man had found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shot him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through the shoulder with an arrow, and Sir Tristram leapt up and killed that man.
<p/>And in the meantime it was told King Mark how Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in that same manor, and as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might thither he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came with many knights to slay Sir Tristram.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gone; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took La Beale Isoud home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) strait that by no means never she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) might wit nor send unto Tristram, nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>).
<p/>And then when Sir Tristram came toward the old manor he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found the track of many horses, and thereby he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wist his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady was gone.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram took great sorrow, and endured with great pain long time, for the arrow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was hurt withal was envenomed.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told a lady that was cousin unto Dame Bragwaine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to Sir Tristram, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might not be whole by no means.
<p/>For thy lady, La Beale Isoud, may not help thee, therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) biddeth you haste into Brittany to King Howel, and there ye shall find his (<font color='blue'><b>Howel</b></font>) daughter, Isoud la Blanche Mains, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shall help thee.
<p/>So they departed all save Gouvernail. Then by the mean of La Beale Isoud Then Sir Tristram and Gouvernail gat them shipping, and so sailed into Brittany.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beale</b></font>) said, I am come into this country to have help of your daughter, for it is told me that there is none other may heal me but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and so within a while she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) healed him (<font color='blue'><b>Beale</b></font>).
<p/>And when King Howel wist that it was Sir Tristram he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was full glad of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). CHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Tristram served in war King Howel of Brittany, and slew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) adversary in the field.
<p/>THERE was an earl that hight Grip, and this earl made great war upon the king, and put the king to the worse, and besieged him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>And on a time Sir Kehydius, that was son to King Howel, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Howel</b></font>) issued out he (<font color='blue'><b>Howel</b></font>) was sore wounded, nigh to the death.
<p/>Then Gouvernail went to the king and said: Sir, I counsel you to desire my lord, Sir Tristram, as in your need to help you.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) yede unto Sir Tristram, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wars to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>): For my son, Sir Kehydius, may not go into the field.
<p/>I will do by your counsel, said the king. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I will go to the field and do what I may.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram issued out of the town with such fellowship as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might make, and did such deeds that all Brittany spake of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And then, at the last, by great might and force, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) slew the Earl Grip with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) own hands, and more than an hundred knights he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) slew that day.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram was received worshipfully with procession. Then King Howel embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Howel</b></font>) arms, and said: Sir Tristram, all my kingdom I will resign to thee.
<p/>Then by the great means of King Howel and Kehydius his (<font color='blue'><b>Howel</b></font>) son, by great proffers, there grew great love betwixt Isoud and Sir Tristram, for that lady was both good and fair, and a woman of noble blood and fame.
<p/>And for because Sir Tristram had such cheer and riches, and all other pleasaunce that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had, almost he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had forsaken La Beale Isoud.
<p/>God defend, said Sir Tristram, for I am beholden unto you for your daughter's sake to do for you. And so upon a time Sir Tristram agreed to wed Isoud la Blanche Mains.
<p/>And at the last they were wedded, and solemnly held their marriage. And so when they were abed both Sir Tristram remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) old lady La Beale Isoud.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took such a thought suddenly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was all dismayed, and other cheer made he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) none but with clipping and kissing; as for other fleshly lusts Sir Tristram never thought nor had ado with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>): such mention maketh the French book; also it maketh mention that the lady weened there had been no pleasure but kissing and clipping.
<p/>, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name was Suppinabiles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came over the sea into England, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came into the court of King Arthur, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) met with Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) of the marriage of Sir Tristram.
<p/>Fie upon him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), untrue knight to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady, that so noble a knight as Sir Tristram is should be found to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) first lady false, La Beale Isoud, Queen of Cornwall; but say ye him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) this, said Sir Launcelot, that of all knights in the world I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) most, and had most joy of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and all was for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) noble deeds; and let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wit the love between him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and me is done for ever, and that I give him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) warning from this day forth as his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mortal enemy.
<p/>And in the meantime there was a knight in Brittany Then said Sir Launcelot: CHAPTER XXXVII. How Sir Suppinabiles told Sir Tristram how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was defamed in the court of King Arthur, and of Sir Lamorak.
<p/>THEN departed Sir Suppinabiles unto Brittany again, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found Sir Tristram, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had been in King Arthur's court.
<p/>Then said Sir Tristram: Heard ye anything of me? So God me help, said Sir Suppinabiles, there I heard Sir Launcelot speak of you great shame, and that ye be a false knight to your lady
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bade me do you to wit that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will be your mortal enemy in every place where he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) may meet you.
<p/>So Sir Tristram made great moan and was ashamed that noble knights should defame him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady.
<p/>And in this meanwhile La Beale Isoud made a letter unto Queen Guenever, complaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) of the untruth of Sir Tristram, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had wedded the king's daughter of Brittany.
<p/>Queen Guenever sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) another letter, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) be of good cheer, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) should have joy after sorrow, for Sir Tristram was so noble a knight called, that by crafts of sorcery ladies would make such noble men to wed them.
<p/>But in the end, Queen Guenever said, it shall be thus, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shall hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), and love you better than ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did to-fore.
<p/>So leave we Sir Tristram in Brittany, and speak we of Sir Lamorak de Galis, that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) sailed his (<font color='blue'><b>Galis</b></font>) ship fell on a rock and perished all, save Sir Lamorak and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) squire; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) swam mightily, and fishers of the Isle of Servage took him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) squire was drowned, and the shipmen had great labour to save Sir Lamorak's life, for all the comfort that they could do.
<p/>That me repenteth, said Tristram, for of all knights I loved to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellowship. And the lord of that isle, hight Sir Nabon le Noire, a great mighty giant.
<p/>And this Sir Nabon hated all the knights of King Arthur's, and in no wise he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would do them favour. And these fishers told Sir Lamorak all the guise of Sir Nabon; how there came never knight of King Arthur's
<p/>And at the last battle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did was slain Sir Nanowne le Petite, the which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) put to a shameful death in despite of King Arthur, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was drawn limb-meal.
<p/>That forthinketh me, said Sir Lamorak, for that knight's death, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) was my cousin; and if I were at mine ease as well as ever I was, I would revenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) death.
<p/>Peace, said the fishers, and make here no words, for or ever ye depart from hence Sir Nabon must know that ye have been here, or else we should die for your sake.
<p/>So that I be whole, said Lamorak, of my disease that I have taken in the sea, I will that ye tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) that I am a knight of King Arthur's, for I was never afeard to reneye my lord.
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) destroyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). CHAPTER XXXVIII. How Sir Tristram and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wife arrived in Wales, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met there with Sir Lamorak.
<p/>NOW turn we unto Sir Tristram, that upon a day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took a little barget, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wife Isoud la Blanche Mains, with Sir Kehydius her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother, to play them in the coasts.
<p/>And when they were from the land, there was a wind drove them in to the coast of Wales upon this Isle of Servage, whereas was Sir Lamorak, and there the barget all to-rove; and there Dame Isoud was hurt; and as well as they might they gat into the forest, and there by a well he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) saw Segwarides and a damosel.
<p/>Sir, said Segwarides, I know you for Sir Tristram de Liones, the man in the world that I have most cause to hate, because ye departed the love between me and my wife; but as for that, said Sir Segwarides, I will never hate a noble knight for a light lady; and therefore, I pray you, be my friend, and I will be yours unto my power; for wit ye well ye are hard bestead in this valley, and we shall have enough to do either of us to succour other.
<p/>And then Sir Segwarides brought Sir Tristram to a lady thereby that was born in Cornwall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) all the perils of that valley, and how there came never knight there
<p/>Wit you well, fair lady, said Sir Tristram, that I slew Sir Marhaus and delivered Cornwall from the truage of Ireland, and I am he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that delivered the King of Ireland from Sir Blamore de Ganis, and I am he (<font color='blue'><b>Ganis</b></font>) that beat Sir Palamides; and wit
<p/>And then either saluted other. but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ganis</b></font>) were taken prisoner or slain. ye well I am Sir Tristram de Liones, that by the grace of God shall deliver this woful Isle of Servage.
<p/>So Sir Tristram was well eased. Then one told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) there was a knight of King Arthur's that was wrecked on the rocks.
<p/>We wot not, said the fishers, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) keepeth it no counsel but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is a knight of King Arthur's, and by the mighty lord of this isle he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) setteth nought.
<p/>may, bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hither that I may see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) be any of the knights of Arthur's I shall know him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) name? said Sir Tristram. I pray you, said Sir Tristram, an ye Then the lady prayed the fishers to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place.
<p/>So on the morrow they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thither in a fisher's raiment; and as soon as Sir Tristram saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smiled upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knew not Sir Tristram.
<p/>Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth by your cheer ye have been diseased but late, and also methinketh I should know you heretofore.
<p/>I will well, said Sir Lamorak, that ye have seen me and met with me. Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name.
<p/>Upon a covenant I will tell you, said Sir Lamorak, that is, that ye will tell me whether ye be lord of this island or no, that is called Nabon le Noire.
<p/>Forsooth, said Sir Tristram, I am not he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), nor I hold not of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) foe as well as ye be, and so shall I be found
<p/>Well, said Sir Lamorak, since ye have said so largely unto me, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis, son unto King Pellinore.
<p/>or I depart out of this isle. Forsooth, I trow well, said Sir Tristram, for an ye said other I know the contrary.
<p/>Ah, sir, remember ye not of the fall ye did give me once, and after ye refused me to fight on foot.
<p/>That was not for fear I had of you, said Sir Tristram, but me shamed at that time to have more ado with you, for meseemed ye had enough; but, Sir Lamorak, for my kindness many ladies ye put to a reproof when ye sent the horn from Morgan le Fay to King Mark, whereas ye did this in despite of me.
<p/>What are ye, said Sir Lamorak, that knoweth me? I am Sir Tristram de Liones. Well, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), an it were to do again, so would I do, for I had
<p/>liefer strife and debate fell in King Mark's court rather than Arthur's court, for the honour of both courts be not alike.
<p/>As to that, said Sir Tristram, I know well; but that that was done it was for despite of me, but all your malice, I thank God, hurt not greatly.
<p/>Therefore, said Sir Tristram, ye shall leave all your malice, and so will I, and let us assay how we may win worship between you and me upon this giant Sir Nabon le Noire that is lord of this island, to destroy him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).
<p/>Sir, said Sir Lamorak, now I understand your knighthood, it may not be false that all men say, for of your bounty, noblesse, and worship, of all knights ye are peerless, and for your courtesy and gentleness I showed you ungentleness, and that now me repenteth.
<p/>IN the meantime there came word that Sir Nabon had made a cry that all the people of that isle should be at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) castle the fifth day after.
<p/>And the same day the son of Nabon should be made knight, and all the knights of that valley and thereabout should be there to joust, and all those of the realm of Logris should be there to joust with them of North Wales: and thither came five hundred knights, and they of the country brought thither Sir Lamorak, and Sir Tristram, and Sir Kehydius, and Sir Segwarides, for they durst none otherwise do; and then Sir Nabon lent Sir Lamorak horse and armour at Sir Lamorak's desire, and Sir Lamorak jousted and did such deeds of arms that Nabon and all the people said there was never knight that ever they saw do such deeds of arms; for, as the French book saith, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) for-jousted all that were there, for the most part of five hundred knights, that none abode him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) saddle.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Nabon, and overcame him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and made Sir Segwarides lord of the isle. Then Sir Nabon proffered to play with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) play:
<p/>For I saw never no knight do so much upon a day. I will well, said Sir Lamorak, play as I may, but I am weary and sore bruised.
<p/>And there either gat a spear, but Nabon would not encounter with Sir Lamorak, but smote his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) horse in the forehead, and so slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>); and then Sir Lamorak yede on foot, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) shield and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) sword, and there began strong battle on foot.
<p/>But Sir Lamorak was so sore bruised and short breathed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) traced and traversed somewhat aback. Fair fellow, said Sir Nabon, hold thy hand
<p/>and I shall show thee more courtesy than ever I showed knight, because I have seen this day thy noble knighthood, and therefore stand thou by, and I will wit whether any of thy fellows will have ado with me.
<p/>Then when Sir Tristram heard that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) stepped forth and said: Nabon, lend me horse and sure armour, and I will have ado with thee.
<p/>Well, fellow, said Sir Nabon, go thou to yonder pavilion, and arm thee of the best thou findest there, and I shall play a marvellous play with thee.
<p/>Then said Sir Tristram: Look ye play well, or else peradventure I shall learn you a new play. That is well said, fellow, said Sir Nabon.
<p/>So when Sir Tristram was armed as him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) liked best, and well shielded and sworded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) dressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) on foot; for well he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knew that Sir Nabon would not abide a stroke with a spear, therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would slay all knights' horses.
<p/>Now, fair fellow, Sir Nabon, let us play. So then they fought long on foot, tracing and traversing, smiting and foining long without any rest.
<p/>At the last Sir Nabon prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name. Sir Nabon, I tell thee my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, a knight of Cornwall under King Mark.
<p/>Thou art welcome, said Sir Nabon, for of all knights I have most desired to fight with thee or with Sir Launcelot.
<p/>So then they went eagerly together, and Sir Tristram slew Sir Nabon, and so forthwith he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) leapt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) son, and struck off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) head; and then all the country said they would hold of Sir Tristram.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Tristram, I will not so; here is a worshipful knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, that for me he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shall be lord of this country, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hath done here great deeds of arms.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I will not be lord of this country, for I have not deserved it as well as ye
<p/>, therefore give ye it where ye will, for I will none have. Well, said Sir Tristram, since ye nor I will not have it
<p/>, let us give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that hath not so well deserved it. Do as ye list, said Segwarides, for the gift is yours, for I will none have an
<p/>So was it given to Segwarides, whereof he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thanked them; and so was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lord, and worshipfully he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did govern it.
<p/>And then Sir Segwarides delivered all prisoners, and set good governance in that valley; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) returned into Cornwall, and told King Mark and La Beale Isoud how Sir Tristram had advanced him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to the Isle of Servage, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) proclaimed in all Cornwall of all the adventures of these two knights, so was it openly known.
<p/>But full woe was La Beale Isoud when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) heard tell that Sir Tristram was wedded to Isoud la Blanche Mains.
<p/>I had deserved it. CHAPTER XL How Sir Lamorak departed from Sir Tristram, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met with Sir Frol, and after with Sir Launcelot.
<p/>SO turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that rode toward Arthur's court, and Sir Tristram's wife and Kehydius took a vessel and sailed into Brittany, unto King Howel, where he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was welcome.
<p/>Now turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) was departed from Sir Tristram he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) rode out of the forest, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) came to an hermitage.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) heard of these adventures they marvelled of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) noble deeds. When the hermit saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) came.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I come from this valley. Sir, said the hermit: thereof I marvel. For this twenty winter I saw never no knight pass this country
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was either slain or villainously wounded, or pass as a poor prisoner. Those ill customs, said Sir Lamorak, are fordone, for Sir Tristram slew your lord, Sir Nabon, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) son.
<p/>Then was the hermit glad, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) brethren, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said there was never such a tyrant among Christian men.
<p/>So on the morrow Sir Lamorak departed; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) rode he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) saw four knights fight against one, and that one knight defended him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) well, but at the last the four knights had him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) down.
<p/>And then Sir Lamorak went betwixt them, and asked them why they would slay that one knight, and said it was shame, four against one.
<p/>And therefore, said the hermit, this valley and franchise we will hold of Sir Tristram. Thou shalt well wit, said the four knights, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) is false.
<p/>That is your tale, said Sir Lamorak, and when I hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) also speak, I will say as ye say. Then said Lamorak: Ah, knight, can ye not excuse you, but that ye are a false knight.
<p/>can I excuse me both with my word and with my hands, that I will make good upon one of the best of them, my body to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) body.
<p/>Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), yet Then spake they all at once : We will not jeopardy our bodies as for thee. But wit thou well
<p/>That is too much said, said Sir Lamorak, but many speak behind a man more than they will say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) face; and because of your words ye shall understand that I am one of the simplest of King Arthur's court; in the worship of my lord now do your best, and in despite of you I shall rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).
<p/>And then they lashed all at once to Sir Lamorak, but anon at two strokes Sir Lamorak had slain two of them, and then the other two fled.
<p/>, they said, an King Arthur were here himself, it should not lie in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) power to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) life. So then Sir Lamorak turned again to that knight, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) name.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) said, my name is Sir Frol of the Out Isles. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) rode with Sir Lamorak and bare him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) company.
<p/>And as they rode by the way they saw a seemly knight riding against them, and all in white. Ah, said Frol, yonder knight jousted late with me and smote me down, therefore I will joust with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Ye shall not do so, said Sir Lamorak, by my counsel, an ye will tell me your quarrel, whether ye jousted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) request, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) at yours.
<p/>Sir, said Lamorak, then will I counsel you deal no more with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), for meseemeth by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) countenance he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) should be a noble knight, and no japer; for methinketh he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should be of the Table Round.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Frol, I jousted with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) at my request. Therefore I will not spare, said Sir Frol. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) cried and said: Sir knight, make thee ready to joust.
<p/>That needeth not, said the White Knight, for I have no lust to joust with thee; but yet they feutred their spears, and the White Knight overthrew Sir Frol,
<p/>Then Sir Lamorak rode after him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) name: For meseemeth ye should be of the fellowship of the Round Table.
<p/>Upon a covenant, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), I will tell you my name, so that ye will not discover my name, and also that ye will tell me yours.
<p/>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) way a soft pace. Then, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. And my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake.
<p/>Then they put up their swords, and kissed heartily together, and either made great joy of other. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, an it please you
<p/>I will do you service. God defend, said Launcelot, that any of so noble a blood as ye be should do me service.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said: More, I am in a quest that I must do myself alone. Now God speed you, said Sir Lamorak, and so they departed.
<p/>Then Sir Lamorak came to Sir Frol and horsed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) again. What knight is that? said Sir Frol. Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) said, it is not for you to know, nor it is no point of my charge.
<p/>Ye may do as ye list, said Sir Lamorak, and yet by my company ye have saved the fairest flower of your garland; so they departed.
<p/>Ye are the more uncourteous, said Sir Frol, and therefore I will depart from you. CHAPTER XLI. How Sir Lamorak slew Sir Frol, and of the courteous fighting with Sir Belliance his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) brother.
<p/>THEN within two or three days Sir Lamorak found a knight at a well sleeping, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) lady sat with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) and waked.
<p/>Right so came Sir Gawaine and took the knight's lady, and set her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) squire. So Sir Lamorak rode after Sir Gawaine, and said: Sir Gawaine, turn again.
<p/>Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), for that cause I will spare you, else that lady should abide with me, or else ye should joust with me.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) and ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) that ought the lady, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) spear, but the knight with pure might smote down Sir Gawaine, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) lady with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>).
<p/>And then said Sir Gawaine: What will ye do with me? for I am nephew unto King Arthur. All this Sir Lamorak saw, and said to himself:
<p/>But I revenge my fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) will say of me dishonour in King Arthur's court. Then Sir Lamorak returned and proffered that knight to joust.
<p/>And there they came together with all their might, and there Sir Lamorak smote the knight through both sides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) fell to the earth dead.
<p/>Then that lady rode to that knight's brother that hight Belliance le Orgulus, that dwelt fast thereby, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) how his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brother was slain.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horsed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) overtook Sir Lamorak, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>): Turn and leave that lady, for thou
<p/>and I must play a new play; for thou hast slain my brother Sir Frol, that was a better knight than ever wert thou.
<p/>Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), I am ready. Alas, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), I will be revenged. It might well be, said Sir Lamorak, but this day in the field I was found the better.
<p/>So they rode together, and unhorsed other, and turned their shields, and drew their swords, and fought mightily as noble knights proved, by the space of two hours.
<p/>So then Sir Belliance prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) name. Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis.
<p/>Ah, said Sir Belliance, thou art the man in the world that I most hate, for I slew my sons for thy sake, where I saved thy life, and now thou hast slain my brother Sir Frol.
<p/>Alas, said Sir Lamorak, full well me ought to know you, for ye are the man that most have done for me.
<p/>Alas, how should I be accorded with thee; therefore defend thee, for thou shalt die, there is none other remedy. And therewithal Sir Lamorak kneeled down, and besought him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) of grace.
<p/>That shall not need, said Sir Lamorak, for I will yield me unto you, not for fear of you, nor for your strength, but your goodness maketh me full loath to have ado with you; wherefore I require you for God's sake, and for the honour of knighthood, forgive me all that I have offended unto you.
<p/>Arise, said Sir Belliance, or else thereas thou kneelest I shall slay thee. Alas, said Belliance, leave thy kneeling, or else I shall slay thee without mercy.
<p/>And at the last Belliance withdrew him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) aback and set him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) down softly upon a little hill, for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was so faint for bleeding that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might not stand.
<p/>Then they yede again unto battle, and either wounded other, that all the ground was bloody thereas they fought. Then Sir Lamorak threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) shield upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) back, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) what cheer.
<p/>Ah, Knight Sir Belliance, said Sir Lamorak, thou art a fool, for an I had had thee at such advantage as thou hast done me, I should slay thee; but thy gentleness is so good and so large, that I must needs forgive thee mine evil will.
<p/>And then Sir Lamorak kneeled down, and unlaced first his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) umberere, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) own, and then either kissed other with weeping tears.
<p/>Then Sir Lamorak led Sir Belliance to an abbey fast by, and there Sir Lamorak would not depart from Belliance till he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) was whole.
<p/>Well, said Sir Belliance. Ah, Sir, yet shall I show you favour in your mal-ease. And then they sware together that none of them should never fight against other.
<p/>So Sir Lamorak departed and went to the court of King Arthur. Here leave we of Sir Lamorak and of Sir Tristram.
<p/>How a young man came into the court of King Arthur, and how Sir Kay called him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) in scorn La Cote Male Taile.
<p/>AT the court of King Arthur there came a young man and bigly made, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was richly beseen: and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired to be made knight of the king, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over-garment sat over-thwartly, howbeit it was rich cloth of gold.
<p/>And here beginneth the history of La Cote Male Taile. BOOK IX. CHAPTER I. What is your name? said King Arthur.
<p/>Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), my name is Breunor le Noire, and within short space ye shall know that I am of good kin.
<p/>It may well be, said Sir Kay, the Seneschal, but in mockage ye shall be called La Cote Male Taile, that is as much to say, the evil-shapen coat
<p/>It is a great thing that thou askest, said the king; and for what cause wearest thou that rich coat? tell me, for I can well think for some cause it is.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) answered, I had a father, a noble knight, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) rode a-hunting, upon a day it happed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to lay him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) down to sleep; and there came a knight that had been long his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) enemy, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was fast asleep
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) all to-hew him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); and this same coat had my father on the same time; and that maketh this coat to sit so evil upon me, for the strokes be on it as I found it, and never shall be amended for me.
<p/>Thus to have my father's death in remembrance I wear this coat till I be revenged; and because ye are called the most noblest king of the world
<p/>Sir, said Sir Lamorak and Sir Gaheris, it were well done to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) knight; for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) beseemeth well of person and of countenance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) shall prove a good man, and a good knight, and a mighty; for, Sir, an ye be remembered, even such one was Sir Launcelot du Lake when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came first into this court, and full few of us knew from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came; and now is he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) proved the man of most worship in the world; and all your court and all your Round Table is by Sir Launcelot worshipped and amended more than by any knight now living.
<p/>I come to you that ye should make me knight. That is truth, said the king, and to-morrow at your request I shall make him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knight.
<p/>So on the morrow there was an hart found, and thither rode King Arthur with a company of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knights to slay the hart.
<p/>And this young man that Sir Kay named La Cote Male Taile was there left behind with Queen Guenever; and by sudden adventure there was an horrible lion kept in a strong tower of stone, and it happened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) at that time brake loose, and came hurling afore the queen and her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) knights.
<p/>And when the queen saw the lion she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) cried and fled, and prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) knights to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>). And there was none of them all but twelve that abode, and all the other fled.
<p/>Now I see well that all coward knights be not dead; and therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) sword and dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) afore the lion.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) then smote him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) in the midst of the head such a mighty stroke that it clave his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) head in sunder, and dashed to the earth.
<p/>Then was it told the queen how the young man that Sir Kay named by scorn La Cote Male Taile had slain the lion.
<p/>Then said La Cote Male Taile: And that lion gaped wide and came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) ramping to have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>). With that the king came home.
<p/>And when the queen told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of that adventure, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was well pleased, and said: Upon pain of mine head he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shall prove a noble man and a faithful knight, and true of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) promise: then the king forthwithal made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) knight.
<p/>Now Sir, said this young knight, I require you and all the knights of your court, that ye call me by none other name
<p/>but La Cote Male Taile : in so much as Sir Kay hath so named me so will I be called.
<p/>How a damosel came into the court and desired a knight to take on him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) an enquest, which La Cote Male Taile emprised.
<p/>THEN that same day there came a damosel into the court, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) a great black shield, with a white hand in the midst holding a sword.
<p/>I assent me well thereto, said the king. CHAPTER II. Other picture was there none in that shield. When King Arthur saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) from whence
<p/>Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) said, I have ridden long and many a day with this shield many ways, and for this cause I am come to your court: there was a good knight that ought this shield, and this knight had undertaken a great deed of arms to enchieve it; and so it misfortuned him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) another strong knight met with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) by sudden adventure, and there they fought long, and either wounded other passing sore; and they were so weary that they left that battle even hand.
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) must die; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) commanded me to bear this shield to the court of King Arthur, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) requiring and praying some good knight to take this shield, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would fulfil the quest that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was in.
<p/>Now what say ye to this quest? said King Arthur; is there any of you here that will take upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to wield this shield?
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came and what she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would. So this knight that ought this shield saw none other way Then was there not one that would speak one word.
<p/>Then Sir Kay took the shield in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) hands. Sir knight, said the damosel, what is your name? Wit ye well, said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal, that wide-where is known.
<p/>Sir, said that damosel, lay down that shield, for wit ye well it falleth not for you, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) must be a better knight than ye that shall wield this shield.
<p/>well I took this shield in my hands by your leave for to behold it, not to that intent; but go
<p/>Damosel, said Sir Kay, wit ye wheresomever thou wilt, for I will not go with you. Then the damosel stood still a great while and beheld many of those knights.
<p/>Then spake the knight, La Cote Male Taile: Fair damosel, I will take the shield and that adventure upon me, so
<p/>I wist I should know whitherward my journey might be; for because I was this day made knight I would take this adventure upon me.
<p/>Well mayest thou be called so, said the damosel, the knight with the evil-shapen coat; but an thou be so hardy to take upon thee to bear that shield and to follow me, wit
<p/>What is your name, fair young man? said the damosel. My name is, said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), La Cote Male Taile. thou well thy skin shall be as well hewn as thy coat.
<p/>As for that, said La Cote Male Taile, when I am so hewn I will ask you no salve to heal me withal.
<p/>And forthwithal there came into the court two squires and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) great horses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) armour, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) spears, and anon
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) was armed and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) leave. I would not by my will, said the king, that ye took upon you that hard adventure.
<p/>Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), this adventure is mine, and the first that ever I took upon me, and that will I follow whatsomever come of me.
<p/>Then that damosel departed, and La Cote Male Taile fast followed after. And within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) overtook the damosel, and anon
<p/>How La Cote Male Taile overthrew Sir Dagonet the king's fool, and of the rebuke that he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) had of the damosel.
<p/>THEN Sir Kay ordained Sir Dagonet, King Arthur's fool, to follow after La Cote Male Taile; and there Sir Kay ordained that Sir Dagonet was horsed and armed, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) follow La Cote Male Taile and proffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) to joust, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) did; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) saw La Cote Male Taile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) cried and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>)
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) missaid him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) in the foulest manner. CHAPTER III. make him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) ready to joust. So Sir La Cote Male Taile smote Sir Dagonet over his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) horse's croup.
<p/>now art thou shamed in Arthur's court, when they send a fool to have ado with thee, and specially at thy first jousts; thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) rode long, and chid.
<p/>And within a while there came Sir Bleoberis, the good knight, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) jousted with La Cote Male Taile, and there Sir Bleoberis smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) so sore, that horse and all fell to the earth.
<p/>Then La Cote Male Taile arose up lightly, and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) shield, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) sword, and would have done battle to the utterance, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) was wood wroth.
<p/>Then the damosel mocked La Cote Male Taile, and said: Fie for shame! Not so, said Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, as at this time I will not fight upon foot.
<p/>Ah, damosel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ganis</b></font>) said, I pray you of mercy to missay me no more, my grief is enough though ye give me no more; I call myself never the worse knight when a mare's son faileth me, and also I count me never the worse knight for a fall of Sir Bleoberis.
<p/>So thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) rode with her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) two days; and by fortune there came Sir Palomides and encountered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) in the same wise served him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) as did Bleoberis to-forehand.
<p/>What dost thou here in my fellowship? said the damosel Maledisant, thou canst not sit no knight, nor withstand him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) one buffet, but if it were Sir Dagonet.
<p/>Ah, fair damosel, I am not the worse to take a fall of Sir Palomides, and yet great disworship have I none, for neither Bleoberis nor yet Palomides would not fight with me on foot.
<p/>Then the damosel Maledisant rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) in the foulest manner, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>): Turn again, coward. As for that, said the damosel, wit thou
<p/>well they have disdain and scorn to light off their horses to fight with such a lewd knight as thou art.
<p/>So in the meanwhile there came Sir Mordred, Sir Gawaine's brother, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) fell in the fellowship with the damosel Maledisant.
<p/>And then they came afore the Castle Orgulous, and there was such a custom that there might no knight come by that castle but either he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) must joust or be prisoner, or at the least to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) harness.
<p/>And there came out two knights against them, and Sir Mordred jousted with the foremost, and that knight of the castle smote Sir Mordred down off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse.
<p/>And then La Cote Male Taile jousted with that other, and either of them smote other down, horse and all, to the earth.
<p/>And when they avoided their horses, then either of them took other's horses. And then La Cote Male Taile rode unto that knight that smote down Sir Mordred, and jousted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>).
<p/>And there Sir La Cote Male Taile hurt and wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) passing sore, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) horse as he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) had been dead.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) turned unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) that met him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) afore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) took the flight towards the castle, and Sir La Cote Male Taile rode after him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) into the Castle Orgulous, and there La Cote Male Taile slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>).
<p/>CHAPTER IV. How La Cote Male Taile fought against an hundred knights, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) escaped by the mean of a lady.
<p/>there came an hundred knights about him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) and assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>); and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) horse should be slain he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) alighted and voided his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) horse, and put the bridle under his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) feet, and so put him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) out of the gate.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) had so done he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) hurled in among them, and dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) back unto a lady's chamber-wall, thinking himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) had liefer die there with worship than to abide the rebukes of the damosel Maledisant.
<p/>And in the meantime as he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) stood and fought, that lady whose was the chamber went out slily at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) postern, and without the gates she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found La Cote Male Taile's horse, and lightly she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gat him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) by the bridle, and tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) to the postern.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went unto her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chamber slily again for to behold how that one knight fought against an hundred knights.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) long she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went to a window behind his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) back, and said: Thou knight, thou fightest wonderly well, but for
<p/>all that at the last thou must needs die, but, an thou canst through thy mighty prowess, win unto yonder postern, for there have I fastened thy horse to abide thee: but wit thou well thou must think on thy worship, and think not to die, for thou mayst not win unto that postern without thou do nobly and mightily.
<p/>When La Cote Male Taile heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) say so he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) hands, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) shield fair afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>), and through the thickest press he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) thrulled through them.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) came to the postern he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) found there ready four knights, and at two the first strokes he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) slew two of the knights, and the other fled; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) won his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) horse and rode from them.
<p/>And all as it was it was rehearsed in King Arthur's court, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) slew twelve knights within the Castle Orgulous; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) rode on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) way.
<p/>AND anon And in the meanwhile the damosel said to Sir Mordred: I ween my foolish knight be either slain or taken prisoner:
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was come unto them he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) told all how he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had sped and escaped in despite of them all:
<p/>Thou liest falsely, said the damosel, that dare I make good, but as a fool and a dastard to all knighthood they have let thee pass.
<p/>then were they ware where he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) came riding. And some of the best of them will tell no tales. That may ye prove, said La Cote Male Taile.
<p/>With that she (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) sent a courier of hers, that rode alway with her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), for to know the truth of this deed; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) rode thither lightly, and asked how and in what manner that La Cote Male Taile was escaped out of the castle.
<p/>: For he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) hath slain here twelve of our best knights, and we weened unto this day that it had been too much for Sir Launcelot du Lake or for Sir Tristram de Liones.
<p/>Then all the knights cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>), and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) was a fiend and no man And in despite of us all he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) is departed from us and maugre our heads.
<p/>With this answer the courier departed and came to Maledisant his (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) lady, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) all how Sir La Cote Male Taile had sped at the Castle Orgulous.
<p/>By my head, said Sir Mordred to the damosel, ye are greatly to blame so to rebuke him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>), for I warn you
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) shall prove a noble knight; but as yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) may not yet sit sure on horseback, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) that shall be a good horseman it must come of usage and exercise.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) cometh to the strokes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) sword he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) is then noble and mighty, and that saw Sir Bleoberis and Sir Palomides, for wit
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) smote down her (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) head, and said little. plainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) is a good knight, and I doubt not ye well they are wily men of arms, and anon
<p/>they know when they see a young knight by his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) riding, how they are sure to give him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) a fall from his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse or a great buffet.
<p/>But for the most part they will not light on foot with young knights, for they are wight and strongly armed.
<p/>For in likewise Sir Launcelot du Lake, when he (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) was first made knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) was often put to the worse upon horseback, but ever upon foot he (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) renown, and slew and defoiled many knights of the Round Table.
<p/>And therefore the rebukes that Sir Launcelot did unto many knights causeth them that be men of prowess to beware; for often I have seen the old proved knights rebuked and slain by them that were but young beginners.
<p/>How Sir Launcelot came to the court and heard of La Cote Male Taile, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) followed after him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>), and how La Cote Male Taile was prisoner.
<p/>HERE leave we off a while of this tale, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du Lake,-LSB-*9-RSB- that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) was come to the court of King Arthur, then heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tell of the young knight La Cote Male Taile, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) slew the lion, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) took upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) the adventure of the black shield, the which was named at that time the hardiest adventure of the world.
<p/>So God me save, said Sir Launcelot unto many of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fellows, it was shame to all the noble knights to suffer such a young knight to take such adventure upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) destruction; for I will that ye wit, said Sir Launcelot, that that damosel Maledisant hath borne that shield many a day for to seek the most proved knights, and that was she (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) that Breuse Saunce Pite took that shield from her (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>), and after Tristram de Liones rescued that shield from him (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) and gave it to the damosel again, a little afore that time that Sir Tristram fought with my nephew Sir Blamore de Ganis, for a quarrel that was betwixt the King of Ireland and him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>Thus they rode sure talking by the way together. CHAPTER V. Then many knights were sorry that Sir La Cote Male Taile was gone forth to that adventure.
<p/>Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I cast me to ride after him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>). And within seven days Sir Launcelot overtook La Cote Male Taile, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) and the damosel Maledisant.
<p/>And when Sir Mordred saw Sir Launcelot, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) left their fellowship; and so Sir Launcelot rode with them all a day, and ever that damosel rebuked La Cote Male Taile; and then Sir Launcelot answered for him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>), then she (<font color='blue'><b>Launcelot</b></font>) left off, and rebuked Sir Launcelot.
<p/>So this meantime Sir Tristram sent by a damosel a letter unto Sir Launcelot, excusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) of the wedding of Isoud la Blanche Mains; and said in the letter, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was a true knight he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had never ado fleshly with Isoud la Blanche Mains; and passing courteously and gentily Sir Tristram wrote unto Sir Launcelot, ever beseeching him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) good friend and unto La Beale Isoud of Cornwall, and that Sir Launcelot would excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) if that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>).
<p/>And within short time by the grace of God, said Sir Tristram, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would speak with La Beale Isoud, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) right hastily.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot departed from the damosel and from Sir La Cote Male Taile, for to oversee that letter, and to write another letter unto Sir Tristram de Liones.
<p/>And in the meanwhile La Cote Male Taile rode with the damosel until they came to a castle that hight Pendragon; and there were six knights stood afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>), and one of them proffered to joust with La Cote Male Taile.
<p/>-LSB-*9-RSB- Printed by Caxton as part of chap. iv. And there La Cote Male Taile smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) horse's croup.
<p/>And then the five knights set upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) all at once with their spears, and there they smote La Cote Male Taile down, horse and man.
<p/>And then they alighted suddenly, and set their hands upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) all at once, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) prisoner, and so led him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) unto the castle and kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) as prisoner.
<p/>And on the morn Sir Launcelot arose, and delivered the damosel with letters unto Sir Tristram, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way after La Cote Male Taile; and by the way upon a bridge there was a knight proffered Sir Launcelot to joust, and Sir Launcelot smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) down, and then they fought upon foot a noble battle together, and a mighty; and at the last Sir Launcelot smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) down grovelling upon his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hands and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) knees.
<p/>And then that knight yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and Sir Launcelot received him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fair. Sir, said the knight, I require thee tell me your name, for much my heart giveth unto you.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Launcelot, as at this time I will not tell you my name, unless then that ye tell me your name.
<p/>Certainly, said the knight, my name is Sir Nerovens, that was made knight of my lord Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, Nerovens de Lile, said Sir Launcelot, I am right glad that ye are proved a good knight,
<p/>for now wit ye well my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said Sir Nerovens de Lile, what have I done!
<p/>And therewithal flatling he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) feet, and would have kissed them, but Sir Launcelot would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); and then either made great joy of other.
<p/>And then Sir Nerovens told Sir Launcelot that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should not go by the Castle of Pendragon: For there is a lord, a mighty knight, and many knights with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and
<p/>this night I heard say that they took a knight prisoner yesterday that rode with a damosel, and they say he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is a Knight of the Round Table.
<p/>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot fought with six knights, and after with Sir Brian, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) delivered the prisoners. AH, said Sir Launcelot, that knight is my fellow, and
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall I rescue or else I shall lose my life therefore. And therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode fast till he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came before the Castle of Pendragon; and anon therewithal
<p/>there came six knights, and all made them ready to set upon Sir Launcelot at once; then Sir Launcelot feutred his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear, and smote the foremost that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brake his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) back in-sunder, and three of them hit and three failed.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot passed through them, and lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) turned in again, and smote another knight through the breast and throughout the back more than an ell, and therewithal his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear brake.
<p/>And at every stroke Sir Launcelot bestowed so his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) strokes that at four strokes sundry they avoided their saddles, passing sore wounded; and forthwithal he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode hurling into that castle.
<p/>And anon the lord of the castle, that was that time cleped Sir Brian de les Isles, the which was a noble man and a great enemy unto King Arthur, within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was armed and upon horseback.
<p/>So then all the remnant of the four knights drew their swords and lashed at Sir Launcelot. And then they feutred their spears and hurled together so strongly that both their horses rashed to the earth.
<p/>And then they avoided their saddles, and dressed their shields, and drew their swords, and flang together as wood men, and there were many strokes given in a while.
<p/>At the last Sir Launcelot gave to Sir Brian such a buffet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) kneeled upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) knees, and then Sir Launcelot rashed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>), and with great force he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) helm; and when Sir Brian saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) should be slain he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>), and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) mercy and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) grace.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot made him (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) to deliver all his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) prisoners that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) had within his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) castle, and therein Sir Launcelot found of Arthur's knights thirty, and forty ladies, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) delivered them; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) way.
<p/>The meanwhile Sir Nerovens, that Sir Launcelot had foughten withal afore at the bridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sent a damosel after Sir Launcelot to wit how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sped at the Castle of Pendragon.
<p/>And then they within the castle marvelled what knight he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was, when Sir Brian and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) knights delivered all those prisoners.
<p/>Have ye no marvel, said the damosel, for the best knight in this world was here, and did this journey, and wit ye well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, it was Sir Launcelot.
<p/>Then was Sir Brian full glad, and so was his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) lady, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Brian</b></font>) knights, that such a man should win them.
<p/>And when the damosel and La Cote Male Taile understood that it was Sir Launcelot du Lake that had ridden with them in fellowship, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) coward, then was she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passing heavy.
<p/>And anon as La Cote Male Taile was delivered he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) horse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) harness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) damosel Maledisant. CHAPTER VII.
<p/>How Sir Launcelot met with the damosel named Male disant, and named her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the Damosel Bienpensant. SO then they took their horses and rode forth a pace after Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And within two mile they overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>), and saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>), and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>), and the damosel cried Sir Launcelot mercy of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) evil deed and saying: For now I know the flower of all knighthood is departed even between Sir Tristram and you.
<p/>For God knoweth, said the damosel, that I have sought you my lord, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram long, and now I thank God I have met with you; and once at Camelot I met with Sir Tristram, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rescued this black shield with the white hand holding a naked sword that Sir Breuse Saunce Pite had taken from me.
<p/>Sir, said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), there came a damosel from a knight that ye fought withal at the bridge, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me your name was Sir Launcelot du Lake.
<p/>Now, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, who told you my name? Blame have she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) then, said Sir Launcelot, but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord, Sir Nerovens, hath told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>But, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, upon this covenant I will ride with you, so that ye will not rebuke this knight Sir La Cote Male Taile no more; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) is a good knight, and I doubt not he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) shall prove a noble knight, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) sake and pity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) should not be destroyed
<p/>I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) to succour him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) in this great need. Ah, Jesu thank you, said the damosel, for now I will say unto you and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) both
<p/>, I rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) never for no hate that I hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>), but for great love that I had to him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>).
<p/>And therefore by my will I would have driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) away for jealousy that I had of his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) life, for it may be no young knight's deed that shall enchieve this adventure to the end.
<p/>For ever I supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had been too young and too tender to take upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) these adventures. Pardieu, said Sir Launcelot, it is well said, and where ye are called the Damosel Maledisant
<p/>And so they rode forth a great while unto they came to the border of the country of Surluse, and there they found a fair village with a strong bridge like a fortress.
<p/>I will call you the Damosel Bienpensant. And when Sir Launcelot and they were at the bridge there stert forth afore them of gentlemen and yeomen
<p/>many, that said: Fair lords, ye may not pass this bridge and this fortress because of that black shield that I see one of you bear, and therefore there shall not pass but one of you at once
<p/>; therefore choose you which of you shall enter within this bridge first. Then Sir Launcelot proffered himself first to enter within this bridge.
<p/>I beseech you let me enter within this fortress, and if I may speed well I will send for you, and if it happened that I be slain, there it goeth.
<p/>Sir, said La Cote Male Taile, And if so be that I am a prisoner taken, then may ye rescue me.
<p/>I am loath, said Sir Launcelot, to let you pass this passage. Sir, said La Cote Male Taile, I pray you let me put my body in this adventure.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) entered, and anon there met with him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) two brethren, the one hight Sir Plaine de Force, and the other hight Sir Plaine de Amours.
<p/>And anon they met with Sir La Cote Male Taile; and first La Cote Male Taile smote down Plaine de Force, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) smote down Plaine de Amours; and then they dressed them to their shields and swords, and bade La Cote Male Taile alight, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) did; and there was dashing and foining with swords, and so they began to assail full hard La Cote Male Taile, and many great wounds they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) head, and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) breast, and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>Now go your way, said Sir Launcelot, and Jesu be your speed. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) might ever among he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) gave sad strokes again.
<p/>And then the two brethren traced and traversed for to be of both hands of Sir La Cote Male Taile, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) by fine force and knightly prowess
<p/>And then when he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) felt himself so wounded, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) strokes, and gave them so many wounds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) felled them to the earth, and would have slain them
<p/>And right so Sir La Cote Male Taile took the best horse that there was of them three, and so rode forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) way to the other fortress and bridge; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) met with the third brother whose name was Sir Plenorius, a full noble knight, and there they jousted together, and either smote other down, horse and man, to the earth.
<p/>And then they avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their swords, and gave many sad strokes, and one while the one knight was afore on the bridge, and another while the other.
<p/>gat them afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). had they not yielded them. And thus they fought two hours and more, and never rested. And ever Sir Launcelot and the damosel beheld them.
<p/>Now may ye see, said Sir Launcelot, that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is a noble knight, for to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) first battle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) grievous wounds; and even forthwithal so wounded as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is, it is marvel that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) may endure this long battle with that good knight.
<p/>How La Cote Male Taile was taken prisoner, and after rescued by Sir Launcelot, and how Sir Launcelot overcame four brethren.
<p/>THIS meanwhile Sir La Cote Male Taile sank right down upon the earth, what for-wounded and what for-bled he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) might not stand.
<p/>Then the other knight had pity of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and said: Fair young knight, dismay you not, for had ye been fresh when ye met with me, as I was,
<p/>well that I should not have endured so long as ye have done; and therefore for your noble deeds of arms I shall show to you kindness and gentleness in all that I may.
<p/>Alas, said the damosel, my knight fighteth passing sore and over long. CHAPTER VIII. I wot And forthwithal this noble knight, Sir Plenorius, took him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) up in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) arms, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) tower.
<p/>Sir, said La Cote Male Taile, withdraw you from me, and hie you to yonder bridge again, for there will meet with you another manner knight than ever was I.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) the wine, and made to search him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and to stop his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bleeding wounds. Why, said Plenorius, is there another manner knight behind of your fellowship?
<p/>Yea, said La Cote Male Taile, there is a much better knight than I am. What is his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name? said Plenorius.
<p/>Ye shall not know for me, said La Cote Male Taile. Well, said the knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall be encountered withal whatsomever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be.
<p/>either thou must deliver me the prisoner that thou hast led unto thy tower, or else come and do battle with me.
<p/>Then Plenorius gat his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse, and came with a spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand walloping toward Sir Launcelot; and then they began to feutre their spears, and came together as thunder, and smote either other so mightily that their horses fell down under them.
<p/>And then they avoided their horses, and pulled out their swords, and like two bulls they lashed together with great strokes and foins; but ever Sir Launcelot recovered ground upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and Sir Plenorius traced to have gone about him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Then Sir Plenorius heard a knight call that said: Sir Plenorius, where art thou? But Sir Launcelot would not suffer that, but bare him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) backer and backer, till he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came nigh his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) tower gate.
<p/>I know thee well for a good knight, but wit thou well thy life and death is in my hand, and therefore yield thee to me, and thy prisoner.
<p/>And then said Sir Launcelot: The other answered no word, but struck mightily upon Sir Launcelot's helm, that the fire sprang out of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) strokes so thick, and smote at him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) so mightily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) kneel upon his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knees.
<p/>And therewith Sir Launcelot leapt upon him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) grovelling down. Then Sir Plenorius yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) tower, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) prisoners at his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) will.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot received him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and took his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) troth; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) rode to the other bridge, and there Sir Launcelot jousted with other three of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) brethren, the one hight Pillounes, and the other hight Pellogris, and the third Sir Pellandris.
<p/>And first upon horseback Sir Launcelot smote them down, and afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) beat them on foot, and made them to yield them unto him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>); and then he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) returned unto Sir Plenorius, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) found in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) prison King Carados of Scotland, and many other knights, and all they were delivered.
<p/>And then Sir La Cote Male Taile came to Sir Launcelot, and then Sir Launcelot would have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) all these fortresses and these bridges.
<p/>Nay, said La Cote Male Taile, I will not have Sir Plenorius' livelihood; with that he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) will grant you, my lord Sir Launcelot, to come unto King Arthur's court, and to be his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knight, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) brethren, I will pray you, my lord, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) livelihood.
<p/>I will well, said Sir Launcelot, with this that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will come to the court of King Arthur and become his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) brethren five.
<p/>And as for you, Sir Plenorius, I will undertake, said Sir Launcelot, at the next feast, so there be a place voided
<p/>Sir, said Plenorius, at the next feast of Pentecost I will be at Arthur's court, and at that time I will be guided and ruled as King Arthur and ye will have me.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot and Sir La Cote Male Taile reposed them there, unto the time that Sir La Cote Male Taile was whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) wounds, and there they had merry cheer, and good rest, and many good games, and there were many fair ladies.
<p/>How Sir Launcelot made La Cote Male Taile lord of the Castle of Pendragon, and after was made knight of the Round Table.
<p/>, that ye shall be Knight of the Round Table. CHAPTER IX. AND in the meanwhile came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, and Sir Brandiles, and anon
<p/>And as Sir Launcelot came by the Castle of Pendragon there he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) put Sir Brian de les Isles from his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) lands, for cause he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) would never be withhold with King Arthur; and all that Castle of Pendragon and all the lands thereof he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) gave to Sir La Cote Male Taile.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot sent for Nerovens that he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) made once knight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) to have all the rule of that castle and of that country, under La Cote Male Taile; and so they rode to Arthur's court all wholly together.
<p/>And at Pentecost next following there was Sir Plenorius and Sir La Cote Male Taile, called otherwise by right Sir Breunor le Noire, both made Knights of the Table Round; and great lands King Arthur gave them, and there Breunor le Noire wedded that damosel Maledisant.
<p/>And after she (<font color='blue'><b>Noire</b></font>) was called Beauvivante, but ever after for the more part he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was called La Cote Male Taile; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) proved a passing noble knight, and mighty; and many worshipful deeds he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) did after in his (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) life; and Sir Plenorius proved a noble knight and full of prowess, and all the days of their life for the most part they awaited upon Sir Launcelot; and Sir Plenorius' brethren were ever knights of King Arthur.
<p/>they fellowshipped with them. And then within ten days, then departed those knights of Arthur's court from these fortresses. And also, as the French book maketh mention, Sir La Cote Male Taile avenged his (<font color='blue'><b>Taile</b></font>) father's death.
<p/>CHAPTER X. How La Beale Isoud sent letters to Sir Tristram by her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) maid Bragwaine, and of divers adventures of Sir Tristram.
<p/>NOW leave we here Sir La Cote Male Taile, and turn we unto Sir Tristram de Liones that was in Brittany.
<p/>When La Beale Isoud understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) was wedded she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) sent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Male</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) maiden Bragwaine as piteous letters as could be thought and made, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) conclusion was that, an it pleased Sir Tristram, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) court, and bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) Isoud la Blanche Mains, and they should be kept as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) herself.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram called unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) Sir Kehydius, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) into Cornwall secretly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was ready at all times.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) let ordain privily a little vessel, and therein they went, Sir Tristram, Kehydius, Dame Bragwaine, and Gouvernail, Sir Tristram's squire.
<p/>So when they were in the sea a contrarious wind blew them on the coasts of North Wales, nigh the Castle Perilous.
<p/>And if so be I come not again by that day take the next way into Cornwall; for in this forest are many strange adventures, as I have heard say, and some of them I cast me to prove or I depart.
<p/>Then said Sir Tristram: Here shall ye abide me these ten days, and Gouvernail, my squire, with you. And when I may I shall hie me after you.
<p/>And so they rode within that forest a mile and more; and at the last Sir Tristram saw afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a likely knight, armed, sitting by a well, and a strong mighty horse passing nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) tied to an oak, and a man hoving and riding by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leading an horse laden with spears.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram and Kehydius took their horses and departed from their fellowship. And this knight that sat at the well seemed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) countenance to be passing heavy.
<p/>ye seem to be a knight-errant by your arms and harness, and therefore dress you to joust with one of us, or with both.
<p/>Therewithal that knight made no words, but took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield and buckled it about his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) neck, and lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse and leapt upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Then Sir Tristram rode near him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and said: Fair knight, why sit ye so drooping? And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took a great spear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) squire, and departed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way a furlong.
<p/>Sir Kehydius asked leave of Sir Tristram to joust first. Do your best, said Sir Tristram. So they met together, and there Sir Kehydius had a fall, and was sore wounded on high above the paps.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram said: Knight, that is well jousted, now make you ready unto me. I am ready, said the knight.
<p/>And then that knight took a greater spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand, and encountered with Sir Tristram, and there by great force that knight smote down Sir Tristram from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and had a great fall.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram was sore ashamed, and lightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield afore his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shoulder, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword.
<p/>I will well, said the knight; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) alighted upon foot, and avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse, and cast his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield upon his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shoulder, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword, and there they fought a long battle together full nigh two hours.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram said: Fair knight, hold thine hand, and tell me of whence thou art, and what is thy name.
<p/>As for that, said the knight, I will be avised; but an thou wilt tell me thy name peradventure I will tell thee mine.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram required that knight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knighthood to alight upon foot and fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). CHAPTER XI. How Sir Tristram met with Sir Lamorak de Galis, and how they fought, and after accorded never to fight together.
<p/>NOW fair knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Sir, said the other knight, and my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis.
<p/>didst me of the sending of the horn unto King Mark's court, to the intent to have slain or dishonoured my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud; and therefore wit thou well, said Sir Tristram, the one of us shall die or we depart.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Lamorak, remember that we were together in the Isle of Servage, and at that time ye promised me great friendship.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram would make no longer delays, but lashed at Sir Lamorak; and thus they fought long till either were weary of other.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram said to Sir Lamorak: In all my life met I never with such a knight that was so big and well breathed as ye be, therefore, said Sir Tristram, it were pity that any of us both should here be mischieved.
<p/>Ah, Sir Lamorak, said Sir Tristram, well be we met, and bethink thee now of the despite thou Sir said Sir Lamorak, for your renown and name I will that ye have the worship of this battle, and
<p/>therefore I will yield me unto you. And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) took the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) sword to yield him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>). Nay, said Sir Tristram, ye shall not do so,
<p/>for well I know your proffers, and more of your gentleness than for any fear or dread ye have of me.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Tristram proffered him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword and said: Sir Lamorak, as an overcome knight I yield me unto you as to a man of the most noble prowess that ever I met withal.
<p/>; I require you let us be sworn together that never none of us shall after this day have ado with other.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak sware that never none of them should fight against other, nor for weal nor for woe.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I will do you gentleness CHAPTER XII. How Sir Palomides followed the Questing Beast, and smote down Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak with one spear.
<p/>AND this meanwhile there came Sir Palomides, the good knight, following the Questing Beast that had in shape a head like a serpent's head, and a body like a leopard, buttocks like a lion, and footed like an hart; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) body there was such a noise as it had been the noise of thirty couple of hounds questing, and such a noise that beast made wheresomever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went; and this beast ever more Sir Palomides followed, for it was called his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) quest.
<p/>And to brief this matter he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) smote down Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak both with one spear; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) departed after the beast Galtisant, that was called the Questing Beast; wherefore these two knights were passing wroth that Sir Palomides would not fight on foot with them.
<p/>Here men may understand that be of worship, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) was never formed that all times might stand, but sometime he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) was put to the worse by mal-fortune; and at sometime the worse knight put the better knight to a rebuke.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak gat Sir Kehydius upon a shield betwixt them both, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to a forester's lodge, and there they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in charge to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) they abode three days.
<p/>And right so as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) followed this beast it came by Sir Tristram, and soon after came Palomides. Then the two knights took their horses and at the cross they departed.
<p/>I require you if ye hap to meet with Sir Palomides, say him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shall find me at the same well where I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and there I, Sir Tristram, shall prove whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) be better knight than I.
<p/>And then said Sir Tristram to Sir Lamorak: And so either departed from other a sundry way, and Sir Tristram rode nigh thereas
<p/>was Sir Kehydius; and Sir Lamorak rode until he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) came to a chapel, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) horse unto pasture.
<p/>, that was King Bagdemagus' son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) there put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bagdemagus</b></font>) horse to pasture, and was not ware of Sir Lamorak; and then this knight Sir Meliagaunce made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) moan of the love that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) had to Queen Guenever, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) made a woful complaint.
<p/>All this heard Sir Lamorak, and on the morn Sir Lamorak took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) horse and rode unto the forest, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) met with two knights hoving under the wood-shaw.
<p/>And anon there came Sir Meliagaunce Fair knights, said Sir Lamorak, what do ye hoving here and watching? and if ye be knights-errant that will joust, lo I am ready.
<p/>Nay, sir knight, they said, not so, we abide not here to joust with you, but we lie here in await of a knight that slew our brother.
<p/>Sir, they said, it is Sir Launcelot that slew our brother, and if ever we may meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) shall not escape, but we shall slay him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>What knight was that, said Sir Lamorak, that you would fain meet withal? Ye take upon you a great charge, said Sir Lamorak, for Sir Launcelot is a noble proved knight.
<p/>I will not believe that, said Sir Lamorak, for I heard never yet of no knight the days of my life
<p/>As for that we doubt not, for there nis none of us but we are good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>). but Sir Launcelot was too big for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>).
<p/>RIGHT so as they stood talking thus Sir Lamorak was ware how Sir Launcelot came riding straight toward them; then Sir Lamorak saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) again.
<p/>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Lamorak met with Sir Meliagaunce, and fought together for the beauty of Dame Guenever. And then Sir Lamorak asked Sir Launcelot if there were anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) might do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) in these marches.
<p/>Then either departed from other, and Sir Lamorak rode again thereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) left the two knights, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) found them hid in the leaved wood.
<p/>Nay, said Sir Launcelot, not at this time I thank you. Fie on you, said Sir Lamorak, false cowards, pity and shame
<p/>it is that any of you should take the high order of knighthood. So Sir Lamorak departed from them, and within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) met with Sir Meliagaunce.
<p/>And then Sir Lamorak asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) loved Queen Guenever as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) did: For I was not far from you when ye made your complaint by the chapel.
<p/>Did ye so? said Sir Meliagaunce, then will I abide by it: I love Queen Guenever, what will ye with it?
<p/>As to that, said Sir Lamorak, I say nay thereto, for Queen Morgawse of Orkney, mother to Sir Gawaine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) mother is the fairest queen and lady that beareth the life.
<p/>I will prove and make good that she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) is the fairest lady and most of beauty in the world. That is not so, said Sir Meliagaunce, and that will I prove with my hands upon thy body.
<p/>Will ye so? said Sir Lamorak, and in a better quarrel keep I not to fight. Then they departed either from other in great wrath.
<p/>And then they came riding together as it had been thunder, and either smote other so sore that their horses fell backward to the earth.
<p/>And then they avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their swords. And then they hurtled together as wild boars, and thus they fought a great while.
<p/>For Meliagaunce was a good man and of great might, but Sir Lamorak was hard big for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) always aback, but either had wounded other sore.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt them, and asked them for what cause they fought so together: And ye are both knights of King Arthur!
<p/>And as they stood thus fighting, by fortune came Sir Launcelot and Sir Bleoberis riding. CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Meliagaunce told for what cause they fought, and how Sir Lamorak jousted with King Arthur.
<p/>I praised my lady, Queen Guenever, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) was the fairest lady of the world, and Sir Lamorak said nay thereto, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) said Queen Morgawse of Orkney was fairer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Morgawse</b></font>) and more of beauty.
<p/>SIR, said Meliagaunce, I shall tell you for what cause we do this battle. Ah, Sir Lamorak, why sayest thou so?
<p/>And therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) alighted on foot, and said: For this quarrel, make thee ready, for I will prove upon thee that Queen Guenever is the fairest lady and most of bounty in the world.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I am loath to have ado with you in this quarrel, for every man thinketh his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) own lady fairest; and though I praise the lady that I love most ye should not be wroth; for though my lady Queen Guenever, be fairest in your eye, wit
<p/>ye well Queen Morgawse of Orkney is fairest in mine eye, and so every knight thinketh his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own lady fairest; and wit ye well,
<p/>sir, ye are the man in the world except Sir Tristram that I am most loathest to have ado withal, but, an ye will needs fight with me
<p/>it is not thy part to dispraise thy princess that thou art under her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) obeissance, and we all. I shall endure you as long as I may.
<p/>Then spake Sir Bleoberis and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, I wist you never so misadvised as ye are now, for Sir Lamorak sayeth you but reason and knightly; for I warn you
<p/>I have a lady, and methinketh that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is the fairest lady of the world. Were this a great reason that ye should be wroth with me for such language?
<p/>And well ye wot, that Sir Lamorak is as noble a knight as I know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) hath ought you and us ever good will, and
<p/>therefore I pray you be good friends. Then Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Lamorak. I pray you forgive me mine evil will, and if I was misadvised I will amend it.
<p/>And so Sir Launcelot and Sir Bleoberis departed, and Sir Meliagaunce and Sir Lamorak took their horses, and either departed from other.
<p/>And within a while came King Arthur, and met with Sir Lamorak, and jousted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>); and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) smote down Sir Lamorak, and wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) sore with a spear, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) rode from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>); wherefore Sir Lamorak was wroth that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) would not fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) on foot, howbeit that Sir Lamorak knew not King Arthur.
<p/>How Sir Kay met with Sir Tristram, and after of the shame spoken of the knights of Cornwall, and how they jousted.
<p/>NOW leave we of this tale, and speak we of Sir Tristram, that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal; and there Sir Kay asked Sir Tristram of what country he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Lamorak, the amends is soon made betwixt you and me. CHAPTER XV. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>) was of the country of Cornwall.
<p/>It may well be, said Sir Kay, for yet heard I never that ever good knight came out of Cornwall. That is evil spoken, said Sir Tristram, but an it please you to tell me your name I require you.
<p/>Sir, wit ye well, said Sir Kay, that my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal. Is that your name? said Sir Tristram, now wit
<p/>ye well that ye are named the shamefullest knight of your tongue that now is living; howbeit ye are called a good knight, but ye are called unfortunate, and passing overthwart of your tongue.
<p/>would not let them pass till one of them jousted with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); and so that knight jousted with Sir Kay, and there that knight gave Sir Kay a fall: his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) name was Sir Tor, Sir Lamorak's half-brother.
<p/>And then they two rode to their lodging, and there they found Sir Brandiles, and Sir Tor came thither anon after.
<p/>And thus they rode together till they came to a bridge. And there was a knight And as they sat at supper these four knights, three of them spake all shame by Cornish knights.
<p/>Sir Tristram heard all that they said and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said but little, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thought the more, but at that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) discovered not his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name.
<p/>And there Sir Brandiles proffered to joust with Sir Tristram, and Sir Tristram smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) down, horse and all, to the earth.
<p/>Then Sir Tor le Fise de Vayshoure encountered with Sir Tristram and there Sir Tristram smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) down, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way, and Sir Kay followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) would not of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) fellowship.
<p/>Upon the morn Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and abode them upon their way. Then Sir Brandiles came to Sir Kay and said: I would wit fain what is that knight's name.
<p/>So they rode together till they came nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and then they were ware where he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) sat by a well, and had put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) helm to drink at the well.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) saw them come he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) laced on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) helm lightly, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse, and proffered them to joust.
<p/>Come on with me, said Sir Kay, and we shall pray him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) to tell us his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) name. Nay, said Sir Brandiles, we jousted late enough with you, we come not in that intent.
<p/>My fair knights, sithen that is your desire, and to please you, ye shall wit that my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, nephew unto King Mark of Cornwall.
<p/>But for this we come to require you of knighthood to tell us your name. In good time, said Sir Brandiles, and well be ye found, and
<p/>wit ye well that we be right glad that we have found you, and we be of a fellowship that would be right glad of your company.
<p/>For ye are the knight in the world that the noble fellowship of the Round Table most desireth to have the company of.
<p/>God thank them said Sir Tristram, of their great goodness, but as yet I feel well that I am unable to be of their fellowship, for I was never yet of such deeds of worthiness to be in the company of such a fellowship.
<p/>Ah, said Sir Kay, an ye be Sir Tristram de Liones, ye are the man called now most of prowess except Sir Launcelot du Lake; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) beareth not the life, Christian nor heathen, that can find such another knight, to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) prowess, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hands, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) truth withal.
<p/>For yet could there never creature say of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) dishonour and make it good. Thus they talked a great while, and then they departed either from other such ways as them seemed best.
<p/>CHAPTER XVI. How King Arthur was brought into the Forest Perilous, and how Sir Tristram saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) life. NOW shall ye hear what was the cause that King Arthur came into the Forest Perilous,
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) name was Annowre, and this lady came to King Arthur at Cardiff; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) by fair promise and fair behests made King Arthur to ride with her (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) into that Forest Perilous; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was a great sorceress; and many days she (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had loved King Arthur, and because she (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to lie by her (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
<p/>So when the king was gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) many of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knights followed after King Arthur when they missed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), as Sir Launcelot, Brandiles, and many other; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) tower she (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) desired him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to lie by her (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>); and then the king remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lady, and would not lie by her (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) for no craft that she (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could do.
<p/>Then every day she (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would make him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ride into that forest with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own knights, to the intent to have had King Arthur slain.
<p/>For when this Lady Annowre saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) might not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) laboured by false means to have destroyed King Arthur, and slain.
<p/>Then the Lady of the Lake that was alway friendly to King Arthur, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) understood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) subtle crafts that King Arthur was like to be destroyed.
<p/>And therefore this Lady of the Lake, that hight Nimue, came into that forest to seek after Sir Launcelot du Lake or Sir Tristram for to help King Arthur;
<p/>that same day this Lady of the Lake knew well that King Arthur should be slain, unless that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had help of one of these two knights.
<p/>that was in North Wales, by the means of a lady. she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came into that country. foras And thus she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode up and down till she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) met with Sir Tristram, and anon as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
<p/>O my lord Sir Tristram, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, well be ye met, and blessed be the time that I have met with you; for this same day, and within these two hours, shall be done the foulest deed that ever was done in this land.
<p/>Come on with me, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, and that in all the haste ye may, for ye shall see the most worshipfullest knight of the world hard bestead.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). O fair damosel, said Sir Tristram, may I amend it. Then said Sir Tristram: I am ready to help such a noble man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is neither better nor worse, said the Lady of the Lake, but the noble King Arthur himself. God defend, said Sir Tristram, that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should be in such distress.
<p/>Then they rode together a great pace, until they came to a little turret or castle; and underneath that castle they saw a knight standing upon foot fighting with two knights; and so Sir Tristram beheld them, and at the last the two knights smote down the one knight, and that one of them unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) helm to have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And the Lady Annowre gat King Arthur's sword in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) hand to have stricken off his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head. And therewithal came Sir Tristram with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might, crying: Traitress, traitress, leave that.
<p/>And anon there Sir Tristram smote the one of the knights through the body that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell dead; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rashed to the other and smote his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) back asunder; and in the meanwhile the Lady of the Lake cried to King Arthur: Let not that false lady escape.
<p/>Then King Arthur overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and with the same sword he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) smote off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, and the Lady of the Lake took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lake</b></font>) head and hung it up by the hair of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lake</b></font>) saddle-bow.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram horsed King Arthur and rode forth with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) charged the Lady of the Lake not to discover his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name as at that time.
<p/>When the king was horsed he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) thanked heartily Sir Tristram, and desired to wit his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was a poor knight adventurous; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bare King Arthur fellowship till he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) met with some of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knights.
<p/>And within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) met with Sir Ector de Maris, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) knew not King Arthur nor Sir Tristram, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) desired to joust with one of them.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had done so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came again to the king and said: My lord, yonder is one of your knights, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) may bare you fellowship, and another day that deed that I have done for you
<p/>Then Sir Tristram rode unto Sir Ector, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse. I trust to God ye shall understand that I would do you service.
<p/>Alas, said King Arthur, let me wit what ye are? Not at this time, said Sir Tristram. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) departed and left King Arthur and Sir Ector together.
<p/>How Sir Tristram came to La Beale Isoud, and how Kehydius began to love Beale Isoud, and of a letter that Tristram found.
<p/>AND then at a day set Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak met at the well; and then they took Kehydius at the forester's house, and so they rode with him (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) to the ship where they left Dame Bragwaine and Gouvernail, and so they sailed into Cornwall all wholly together.
<p/>And by assent and information of Dame Bragwaine when they were landed they rode unto Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, a trusty friend of Sir Tristram's.
<p/>And so Dame Bragwaine and Sir Dinas rode to the court of King Mark, and told the queen, La Beale Isoud, that Sir Tristram was nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) in that country.
<p/>Then for very pure joy La Beale Isoud swooned; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) might speak she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) said: Gentle knight Seneschal, help that I might speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Seneschal</b></font>), outher my heart will brast.
<p/>Then Sir Dinas and Dame Bragwaine brought Sir Tristram and Kehydius privily unto the court, unto a chamber whereas La Beale Isoud had assigned it; and to tell the joys that were betwixt La Beale Isoud and Sir Tristram, there is no tongue can tell it, nor heart think it, nor pen write it.
<p/>CHAPTER XVII. And as the French book maketh mention, at the first time that ever Sir Kehydius saw La Beale Isoud
<p/>And at the last, as ye shall hear or the book be ended, Sir Kehydius died for the love of La Beale Isoud.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was so enamoured upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) that for very pure love he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might never withdraw it. And then privily he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wrote unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) letters and ballads of the most goodliest that were used in those days.
<p/>And when La Beale Isoud understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) letters she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) had pity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) complaint, and unavised she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) wrote another letter to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) withal.
<p/>And Sir Tristram was all this while in a turret at the commandment of La Beale Isoud, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) might she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) came unto Sir Tristram.
<p/>So on a day King Mark played at the chess under a chamber window; and at that time Sir Tristram and Sir Kehydius were within the chamber over King Mark, and as it mishapped Sir Tristram found the letter that Kehydius sent unto La Beale Isoud, also he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had found the letter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) wrote unto Kehydius, and at that same time La Beale Isoud was in the same chamber.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram came unto La Beale Isoud and said: Madam, here is a letter that was sent unto you, and here is the letter that ye sent unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that sent you that letter.
<p/>Alas, Madam, the good love that I have loved you; and many lands and riches have I forsaken for your love, and now ye are a traitress to me, the which doth me great pain.
<p/>, I won his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lands, howbeit I wedded thy sister Isoud la Blanche Mains for the goodness she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) did unto me.
<p/>And yet, as I am true knight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) is a clean maiden for me; but wit thou well, Sir Kehydius, for this falsehood and treason thou hast done me, I will revenge it upon thee.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Tristram drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword and said: Sir Kehydius, keep thee, and then La Beale Isoud swooned to the earth.
<p/>And when Sir Kehydius saw Sir Tristram come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw none other boot, but leapt out at a bay-window even over the head where sat King Mark playing at the chess.
<p/>But as for thee, Sir Kehydius, I brought thee out of Brittany into this country, and thy father, King Howel And when the king saw one come hurling over his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said:
<p/>My lord the king, said Kehydius, it fortuned me that I was asleep in the window above your head, and as I slept I slumbered, and so I fell down.
<p/>Fellow, what art thou, and what is the cause thou leapest out at that window? And thus Sir Kehydius excused him (<font color='blue'><b>Fellow</b></font>).
<p/>How Sir Tristram departed from Tintagil, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sorrowed and was so long in a forest till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) mind.
<p/>THEN Sir Tristram dread sore lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) were discovered unto the king that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was there; wherefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to the strength of the Tower, and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in such armour as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had for to fight with them that would withstand him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And so when Sir Tristram saw there was no resistance against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sent Gouvernail for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear, and knightly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode forth out of the castle openly, that was called the Castle of Tintagil.
<p/>And anon Sir Gingalin put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rest, and ran upon Sir Tristram and brake his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear; and Sir Tristram at that time had but a sword, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) such a buffet upon the helm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saddle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword slid adown, and carved asunder his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse's neck.
<p/>CHAP TER XVIII. And even at gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met with Gingalin, Sir Gawaine's son. And so Sir Tristram rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way into the forest, and all this doing saw King Mark.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sent a squire unto the hurt knight, and commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did.
<p/>And when King Mark wist that it was Sir Gingalin he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) an horse, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) what knight it was that had encountered with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>Sir, said Gingalin, I wot not what knight he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was, but well I wot that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sigheth and maketh great dole.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had met with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made great sorrow, insomuch that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fell down off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse in a swoon, and in such sorrow he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was in three days and three nights.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram within a while met with a knight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) own, that hight Sir Fergus. Then at the last Sir Tristram sent unto the court by Sir Fergus, for to spere what tidings.
<p/>And so as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met with a damosel that came from Sir Palomides, to know and seek how Sir Tristram did.
<p/>Then Sir Fergus told her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was almost out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) mind. Alas, said the damosel, where shall I find him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)?
<p/>In such a place, said Sir Fergus. Then Sir Fergus found Queen Isoud sick in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) bed, making the greatest dole that ever any earthly woman made.
<p/>And when the damosel found Sir Tristram she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) made great dole because she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) might not amend him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>), for the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) made of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) the more was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) pain.
<p/>And then was it three days or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) could find him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) meat and drink, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) would none; and then another time Sir Tristram escaped away from the damosel, and it happed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to ride by the same castle where Sir Palomides and Sir Tristram did battle when La Beale Isoud departed them.
<p/>And there by fortune the damosel met with Sir Tristram again, making the greatest dole that ever earthly creature made; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) yede to the lady of that castle and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) of the misadventure of Sir Tristram.
<p/>And at the last Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and rode away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>). Alas, said the lady of that castle, where is my lord, Sir Tristram?
<p/>In good time, said the lady, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) so nigh me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shall have meat and drink of the best; and an harp I have of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) taught me, for of goodly harping he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) beareth the prize in the world.
<p/>Right here by your castle, said the damosel. So this lady and damosel brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) meat and drink, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ate little thereof.
<p/>Then upon a night he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) armour, and then Sir Tristram would go into the wilderness, and brast down the trees and boughs; and otherwhile when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found the harp that the lady sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), then would he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) harp, and play thereupon and weep together.
<p/>And sometime when Sir Tristram was in the wood that the lady wist not where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was, then would she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sit her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) down and play upon that harp: then would Sir Tristram come to that harp, and hearken thereto, and sometime he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would harp himself.
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) there endured a quarter of a year. Then at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wist not where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was become.
<p/>And then was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) naked and waxed lean and poor of flesh; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell in the fellowship of herdmen and shepherds, and daily they would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) some of their meat and drink.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did any shrewd deed they would beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) with rods, and so they clipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) with shears and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) like a fool.
<p/>How Sir Tristram soused Dagonet in a well, and how Palomides sent a damosel to seek Tristram, and how Palomides met with King Mark.
<p/>AND upon a day Dagonet, King Arthur's fool, came into Cornwall with two squires with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>); and as they rode through that forest they came by a fair well where Sir Tristram was wont to be; and the weather was hot, and they alighted to drink of that well, and in the meanwhile their horses brake loose.
<p/>Right so Sir Tristram came unto them, and first he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) soused Sir Dagonet in that well, and after his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) squires, and thereat laughed the shepherds; and forthwithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ran after their horses and brought them again one by one, and right so, wet as they were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) made them leap up and ride their ways.
<p/>The meanwhile the damosel that Sir Palomides sent to seek Sir Tristram, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) yede unto Sir Palomides and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) all the mischief that Sir Tristram endured.
<p/>Alas, said Sir Palomides, it is great pity that ever so noble a knight should be so mischieved for the love of a lady; but nevertheless, I will go and seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) an I may.
<p/>CHAPTER XIX. Thus Sir Tristram endured there an half year naked, and would never come in town nor village. Then a little before that time La Beale Isoud had commanded Sir Kehydius out of the country of Cornwall.
<p/>So Sir Kehydius departed with a dolorous heart, and by adventure he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met with Sir Palomides, and they enfellowshipped together; and either complained to other of their hot love that they loved La Beale Isoud.
<p/>Now let us, said Sir Palomides, seek Sir Tristram, that loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) as well as we, and let us prove whether we may recover him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>So they rode into that forest, and three days and three nights they would never take their lodging, but ever sought Sir Tristram.
<p/>And upon a time, by adventure, they met with King Mark that was ridden from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) men all alone. When they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) Sir Palomides knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), but Sir Kehydius knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) not.
<p/>Ah, false king, said Sir Palomides, it is pity thou hast thy life, for thou art a destroyer of all worshipful knights, and by thy mischief and thy vengeance thou hast destroyed that most noble knight, Sir Tristram de Liones.
<p/>And therefore defend thee, said Sir Palomides, for thou shalt die this day. That were shame, said King Mark, for ye two are armed and I am unarmed.
<p/>As for that, said Sir Palomides, I shall find a remedy therefore; here is a knight with me, and thou shalt have his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) harness.
<p/>Nay, said King Mark, I will not have ado with you, for cause have ye none to me; for all the misease that Sir Tristram hath was for a letter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found; for as to me I did to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) no displeasure, and God knoweth I am full sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) disease and malady.
<p/>So when the king had thus excused him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) they were friends, and King Mark would have had them unto Tintagil; but Sir Palomides would not, but turned unto the realm of Logris, and Sir Kehydius said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) would go into Brittany.
<p/>Now turn we unto Sir Dagonet again, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) squires were upon horseback he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) deemed that the shepherds had sent that fool to array them so, because that they laughed at them, and so they rode unto the keepers of beasts and all to-beat them.
<p/>Sir Tristram saw them beat that were wont to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) meat and drink, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ran thither and gat Sir Dagonet by the head, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) such a fall to the earth that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bruised him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sore so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lay still.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wrast his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, and therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ran to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) squires and smote off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head, and the other fled.
<p/>And so Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way with that sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, running as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had been wild wood. Then Sir Dagonet rode to King Mark and told him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had sped in that forest.
<p/>that well in the forest, for there is a fool naked, and that fool and I fool met together, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had almost slain me.
<p/>And therefore, said Sir Dagonet, beware, King Mark, that thou come not about Ah, said King Mark, that is Sir Matto le Breune
<p/>, that fell out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) wit because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) lady; for when Sir Gaheris smote down Sir Matto and won his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) lady of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), never since was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) mind, and that was pity, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was a good knight.
<p/>THEN Sir Andred, that was cousin unto Sir Tristram, made a lady that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) paramour to say and to noise it that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was with Sir Tristram or ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) died.
<p/>CHAPTER XX. How it was noised how Sir Tristram was dead, and how La Beale Isoud would have slain herself. And this tale she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) brought unto King Mark's court, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) buried him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) by a well, and that
<p/>or he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) died he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) besought King Mark to make his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) cousin, Sir Andred, king of the country of Liones, of the which Sir Tristram was lord of.
<p/>All this did Sir Andred because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would have had Sir Tristram's lands. And when King Mark heard tell that Sir Tristram was dead he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wept and made great dole.
<p/>But when Queen Isoud heard of these tidings she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) made such sorrow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) was nigh out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) mind; and so upon a day she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) thought to slay herself and never to live after Sir Tristram's death.
<p/>And so upon a day La Beale Isoud gat a sword privily and bare it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) garden, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) pight the sword through a plum tree up to the hilt, so that it stuck fast, and it stood breast high.
<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) would have run upon the sword and to have slain herself all this espied King Mark, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) kneeled down and said: Sweet Lord Jesu, have mercy upon me, for I may not live after the death of Sir Tristram de Liones, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) was my first love and he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) shall be the last.
<p/>And with these words came King Mark and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) arms, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) took up the sword, and bare her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) away with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) into a tower; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) to be kept, and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) surely, and after that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) lay long sick, nigh at the point of death.
<p/>This meanwhile ran Sir Tristram naked in the forest with the sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came to an hermitage, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) down and slept; and in the meanwhile the hermit stole away his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword, and laid meat down by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And there was a giant in that country that hight Tauleas, and for fear of Sir Tristram more than seven year he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) durst never much go at large, but for the most part he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in a sure castle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) own; and so this Tauleas heard tell that Sir Tristram was dead, by the noise of the court of King Mark.
<p/>Thus was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) kept there ten days; and at the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) departed and came to the herdmen again. Then this Tauleas went daily at large.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) happed upon a day he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) came to the herdmen wandering and langering, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) down to rest among them.
<p/>The meanwhile there came a knight of Cornwall that led a lady with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name was Sir Dinant; and when the giant saw him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went from the herdmen and hid him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) under a tree, and so the knight came to that well, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) alighted to repose him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was from his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse this giant Tauleas came betwixt this knight and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse, and took the horse and leapt upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>So forthwith he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode unto Sir Dinant and took him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) by the collar, and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) afore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse, and there would have stricken off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head.
<p/>Then the herdmen said unto Sir Tristram: Help yonder knight. Help ye him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), said Sir Tristram. We dare not, said the herdmen.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram was ware of the sword of the knight thereas it lay; and so thither he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ran and took up the sword and struck off Sir Tauleas' head, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) yede his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way to the herdmen.
<p/>How King Mark found Sir Tristram naked, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) to be borne home to Tintagil, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) was there known by a brachet.
<p/>THEN the knight took up the giant's head and bare it with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) unto King Mark, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) what adventure betid him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) in the forest, and how a naked man rescued him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the grimly giant, Tauleas.
<p/>Forsooth, said Sir Dinant, at the fair fountain in your forest where many adventurous knights meet, and there is the mad man.
<p/>So within a day or two King Mark commanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) knights and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) hunters that they should be ready on the morn for to hunt, and so upon the morn he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) went unto that forest.
<p/>And when the king came to that well he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) found there lying by that well a fair naked man, and a sword by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Then King Mark blew and straked, and therewith his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) knights came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>); and then the king commanded his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knights to:
<p/>CHAPTER XXI. Where had ye this adventure? said King Mark. Well, said King Mark, I will see that wild man. Take that naked man with fairness, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) to my castle.
<p/>So they did softly and fair, and cast mantles upon Sir Tristram, and so led him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) unto Tintagil; and there they bathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and washed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hot suppings till they had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) remembrance; but all this
<p/>So it fell upon a day that the queen, La Beale Isoud, heard of such a man, that ran naked in the forest, and how the king had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) home to the court.
<p/>Then La Beale Isoud called unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) Dame Bragwaine and said: Come on with me, for we will go see this man that my lord brought from the forest the last day.
<p/>while there was no creature that knew Sir Tristram, nor what man he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was. So they passed forth, and spered where was the sick man.
<p/>And then a squire told the queen that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the garden taking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rest, and reposing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) against the sun.
<p/>So when the queen looked upon Sir Tristram she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was not remembered of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). But ever she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) said unto Dame Bragwaine:
<p/>Meseemeth I should have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) heretofore in many places. But as soon as Sir Tristram saw her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) well enough.
<p/>Then the queen had always a little brachet with her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) that Sir Tristram gave her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) the first time that ever she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) came into Cornwall, and never would that brachet depart from her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>)
<p/>but if Sir Tristram was nigh thereas was La Beale Isoud; and this brachet was sent from the king's daughter of France unto Sir Tristram for great love.
<p/>And anon as this little brachet felt a savour of Sir Tristram, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) leapt upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and licked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lears and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ears, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) whined and quested, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) smelled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) feet and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hands, and on all parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) body that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might come to.
<p/>Ah, my lady, said Dame Bragwaine unto La Beale Isoud, alas, alas, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>), I see it is mine own lord, Sir Tristram.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) visage and wept. And thereupon Isoud fell down in a swoon, and so lay a great while
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) might speak she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) said: My lord Sir Tristram, blessed be God ye have your life, and now I am sure ye shall be discovered by this little brachet, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) will never leave you.
<p/>And also I am sure as soon as my lord, King Mark, do know you he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will banish you out of the country of Cornwall, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) will destroy you; for God's sake, mine own lord, grant King Mark his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) will, and then draw you unto the court of King Arthur, for there are ye beloved, and ever when I may
<p/>I shall send unto you; and when ye list ye may come to me, and at all times early and late I will be at your commandment, to live as poor a life as ever did queen or lady.
<p/>O Madam, said Sir Tristram, go from me, for mickle anger and danger have I escaped for your love. CHAPTER XXII.
<p/>THEN the queen departed, but the brachet would not from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and therewithal came King Mark, and the brachet set upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), and bayed at them all.
<p/>How King Mark, by the advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) council, banished Sir Tristram out of Cornwall the term of ten years. There withal Sir Andred spake and said: Sir, this is Sir Tristram, I see by the brachet.
<p/>Nay, said the king, I cannot suppose that. Then the king asked him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) faith what he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was, and what was his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) name.
<p/>So God me help, said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), my name is Sir Tristram de Liones; now do by me what ye list. Ah, said King Mark, me repenteth of your recovery.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) let call his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) barons to judge Sir Tristram to the death. Then many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) barons would not assent thereto, and in especial Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and Sir Fergus.
<p/>And so by the advice of them all Sir Tristram was banished out of the country for ten year, and thereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) oath upon a book before the king and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) barons.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was made to depart out of the country of Cornwall; and there were many barons brought him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) unto his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ship, of the which some were his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) friends and some his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) foes.
<p/>And in the meanwhile there came a knight of King Arthur's, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) name was Dinadan, and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) coming was for to seek after Sir Tristram; then they showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was armed at all points going to the ship.
<p/>Now fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, or ye pass this court that ye will joust with me I require thee. With a good will, said Sir Tristram, an these lords will give me leave.
<p/>Then the barons granted thereto, and so they ran together, and there Sir Tristram gave Sir Dinadan a fall. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) prayed Sir Tristram to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leave to go in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellowship.
<p/>And so they took their horses and rode to their ships together, and when Sir Tristram was in the sea he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said:
<p/>Greet well King Mark and all mine enemies, and say them I will come again when I may; and well am I rewarded for the fighting with Sir Marhaus, and delivered all this country from servage; and well am I rewarded for the fetching and costs of Queen Isoud out of Ireland, and the danger that I was in first and last, and by the way coming home what danger I had to bring again Queen Isoud from the Castle Pluere; and well am I rewarded when I fought with Sir Bleoberis for Sir Segwarides' wife; and well am I rewarded when I fought with Sir Blamore de Ganis for King Anguish, father unto La Beale Isoud; and well am I rewarded when I smote down the good knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, at King Mark's request; and well am I rewarded when I fought with the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King of Northgalis, and both these would have put his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) land in servage, and by me they were put to a rebuke; and well am I rewarded for the slaying of Tauleas, the mighty giant, and many other deeds
<p/>And tell King Mark that many noble knights of the Table Round have spared the barons of this country for my sake.
<p/>Also am I not well rewarded when I fought with the good knight Sir Palomides and rescued Queen Isoud from him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); and at that time King Mark said afore all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) barons I should have been better rewarded.
<p/>Ye shall be right welcome, said then Sir Tristram. have I done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and now have I my warison. And forthwithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took the sea.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIII. How a damosel sought help to help Sir Launcelot against thirty knights, and how Sir Tristram fought with them.
<p/>AND at the next landing, fast by the sea, there met with Sir Tristram and with Sir Dinadan, Sir Ector de Maris and Sir Bors de Ganis; and there Sir Ector jousted with Sir Dinadan, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ector</b></font>) horse down.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram would have jousted with Sir Bors, and Sir Bors said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would not joust with no Cornish knights, for they are not called men of worship; and all this was done upon a bridge.
<p/>And with this came Sir Bleoberis and Sir Driant, and Sir Bleoberis proffered to joust with Sir Tristram, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Bleoberis.
<p/>I wist never Cornish knight of so great valour nor so valiant as that knight that beareth the trappings embroidered with crowns.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan departed from them into a forest, and there met them a damosel that came for the love of Sir Launcelot to seek after some noble knights of King Arthur's court for to rescue Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And so Sir Launcelot was ordained, for-by the treason of Queen Morgan le Fay to have slain Sir Launcelot, and for that cause she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ordained thirty knights to lie in await for Sir Launcelot, and this damosel knew this treason.
<p/>Then said Sir Bors de Ganis: And for this cause the damosel came for to seek noble knights to help Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And so this damosel met with Sir Bors and Sir Ector and with Sir Driant, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) told them all four of the treason of Morgan le Fay; and then they promised her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that they would be nigh where Sir Launcelot should meet with the thirty knights.
<p/>For that night, or the day after, Sir Launcelot should come where these thirty knights were. And if so be they set upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) we will do rescues as we can.
<p/>So the damosel departed, and by adventure the damosel met with Sir Tristram and with Sir Dinadan, and there the damosel told them all the treason that was ordained for Sir Launcelot.
<p/>Fair damosel, said Sir Tristram, bring me to that same place where they should meet with Sir Launcelot. Then said Sir Dinadan:
<p/>it is not for us to fight with thirty knights, and wit you well I will not thereof; as to match one knight two or three is enough an they be men, but for to match fifteen knights that will I never undertake.
<p/>What will ye do? Fie for shame, said Sir Tristram, do but your part. Nay, said Sir Dinadan, I will not thereof
<p/>but if ye will lend me your shield, for ye bear a shield of Cornwall; and for the cowardice that is named to the knights of Cornwall, by your shields
<p/>ye be ever forborne. Nay, said Sir Tristram, I will not depart from my shield for her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) sake that gave it me.
<p/>But one thing, said Sir Tristram, I promise thee, Sir Dinadan, but if thou wilt promise me to abide with me, here I shall slay thee, for I desire no more of thee but answer one knight.
<p/>And if thy heart will not serve thee, stand by and look upon me and them. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, I promise you to look upon and to do what I may to save myself, but
<p/>So then anon these thirty knights came fast by these four knights, and they were ware of them, and either of other.
<p/>And so these thirty knights let them pass, for this cause, that they would not wrath them, if case be that they had ado with Sir Launcelot; and the four knights let them pass to this intent, that they would see and behold what they would do with Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And so the thirty knights passed on and came by Sir Tristram and by Sir Dinadan, and then Sir Tristram cried on high:
<p/>I would I had not met with you. Lo, here is a knight against you for the love of Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slew two with one spear and ten with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword. And then came in Sir Dinadan and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did passing well, and so of the thirty knights
<p/>All this battle saw Sir Bors de Ganis and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ganis</b></font>) three fellows, and then they saw well it was the same knight that jousted with them at the bridge; then they took their horses and rode unto Sir Tristram, and praised him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) good deeds, and they all desired Sir Tristram to go with them to their lodging; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said: Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would not go to no lodging.
<p/>there went but ten away, and they fled. Then they all four knights prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to tell them his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, as at this time I will not tell you my name.
<p/>THEN Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode forth their way till they came to the shepherds and to the herdmen, and there they asked them if they knew any lodging or harbour there nigh hand.
<p/>Forsooth, sirs, said the herdmen, hereby is good lodging in a castle; but there is such a custom that there shall no knight be harboured
<p/>CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan came to a lodging where they must joust with two knights. but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) joust with two knights, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) be but one knight he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) must joust with two.
<p/>And as ye be therein soon shall ye be matched. There is shrewd harbour, said Sir Dinadan; lodge where ye will, for I will not lodge there.
<p/>Fie for shame, said Sir Tristram, are ye not a knight of the Table Round? wherefore ye may not with your worship refuse your lodging.
<p/>Not so, said the herdmen, for an ye be beaten and have the worse ye shall not be lodged there, and if ye beat them ye shall be well harboured.
<p/>Then Sir Dinadan would not lodge there in no manner but as Sir Tristram required him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knighthood; and so they rode thither.
<p/>And to make short tale, Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan smote them down both, and so they entered into the castle and had good cheer as they could think or devise.
<p/>And when they were unarmed, and thought to be merry and in good rest, there came in at the gates Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris, requiring to have the custom of the castle.
<p/>Ah, said Sir Dinadan, they are two sure knights. What array is this? said Sir Dinadan, I would have my rest.
<p/>That may not be, said Sir Tristram; now must we needs defend the custom of this castle, insomuch as we have the better of the lords of this castle, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, needs must ye make you ready.
<p/>And so they made them ready; and Sir Gaheris encountered with Sir Tristram, and Sir Gaheris had a fall; and Sir Palomides encountered with Sir Dinadan, and Sir Dinadan had a fall: then was it fall for fall.
<p/>In the devil's name, said Sir Dinadan, came I into your company. So then must they fight on foot. That would not Sir Dinadan, for he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was so sore bruised of the fall that Sir Palomides gave him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).
<p/>I will not, said Sir Dinadan, for I am sore wounded of the thirty knights that we had but late ago to do withal.
<p/>But ye fare, said Sir Dinadan unto Sir Tristram, as a madman and as a man that is out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) mind that would cast himself away, and I may curse the time that ever I saw you, for in all the world are not two such knights that be so wood as is Sir Launcelot and ye Sir Tristram; for once I fell in the fellowship of Sir Launcelot as I have done now with you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) set me a work that a quarter of a year I kept my bed.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram unlaced Sir Dinadan's helm, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). Jesu defend me, said Sir Dinadan, from such two knights, and specially from your fellowship.
<p/>Then, said Sir Tristram, I will fight with them both. Then Sir Tristram bade them come forth both, for I will fight with you.
<p/>Then Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris dressed them, and smote at them both. Then Dinadan smote at Sir Gaheris a stroke or two, and turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>Nay, said Sir Palomides, it is too much shame for us two knights to fight with one. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did bid Sir Gaheris stand aside with that knight that hath no list to fight.
<p/>Then they rode together and fought long, and at the last Sir Tristram doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) strokes, and drove Sir Palomides aback more than three strides.
<p/>And then by one assent Sir Gaheris and Sir Dinadan went betwixt them, and departed them in-sunder. And then by assent of Sir Tristram they would have lodged together.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) cursed the time that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came in their fellowship, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) harness, and departed.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram prayed the lords of that castle to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a man to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to a lodging, and so they did, and overtook Sir Dinadan, and rode to their lodging two mile thence with a good man in a priory, and there they were well at ease.
<p/>And that same night Sir Bors and Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Ector and Sir Driant, abode still in the same place thereas Sir Tristram fought with the thirty knights; and there they met with Sir Launcelot the same night, and had made promise to lodge with Sir Colgrevance the same night.
<p/>But Sir Dinadan would not lodge in that castle. CHAPTER XXV. How Sir Tristram jousted with Sir Kay and Sir Sagramore
<p/>BUT anon as the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, heard of the shield of Cornwall, then wist he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well that it was Sir Tristram that fought with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) enemies.
<p/>le Desirous, and how Sir Gawaine turned Sir Tristram from Morgan le Fay. And then Sir Launcelot praised Sir Tristram, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the man of most worship in the world.
<p/>So there was a knight in that priory that hight Pellinore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pellinore</b></font>) desired to wit the name of Sir Tristram, but in no wise he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) could not; and so Sir Tristram departed and left Sir Dinadan in the priory, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was so weary and so sore bruised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might not ride.
<p/>Sithen that ye will not tell me that knight's name I will ride after him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and make him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to tell me his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name, or he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall die therefore.
<p/>Then this knight, Sir Pellinore, said to Sir Dinadan: Beware, sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, for an ye follow him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ye shall repent it.
<p/>So that knight, Sir Pellinore, rode after Sir Tristram and required him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) of jousts. Then Sir Tristram smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) down and wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) through the shoulder, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) passed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way.
<p/>And on the next day following Sir Tristram met with pursuivants, and they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that there was made a great cry of tournament between King Carados of Scotland and the King of North Wales, and either should joust against other at the Castle of Maidens; and these pursuivants sought all the country after the good knights, and in especial King Carados let make seeking for Sir Launcelot du Lake, and the King of Northgalis let seek after Sir Tristram de Liones.
<p/>And at that time Sir Tristram thought to be at that jousts; and so by adventure they met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous; and Sir Kay required Sir Tristram to joust, and Sir Tristram in a manner refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) would not be hurt nor bruised against the great jousts that should be before the Castle of Maidens, and therefore thought to repose him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) and to rest him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>).
<p/>When Sir Tristram heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) say so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and then Sir Kay refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) back.
<p/>And alway Sir Kay cried: Sir knight of Cornwall, joust with me, or else yield thee to me as recreant. Then Sir Tristram said: As I find thee I shall take thee.
<p/>Then Sir Sagramore le Desirous rode after Sir Tristram, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to joust with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le Desirous from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way; and the same day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met with a damosel that told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should win great worship of a knight adventurous that did much harm in all that country.
<p/>Then Sir Kay turned with evil will, and Sir Tristram smote Sir Kay down, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode forth. When Sir Tristram heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) say so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was glad to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to win worship.
<p/>So Sir Tristram rode with that damosel a six mile, and then met him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) Sir Gawaine, and therewithal Sir Gawaine knew the damosel, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was a damosel of Queen Morgan le Fay.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) led that knight to some mischief. Fair knight, said Sir Gawaine, whither ride you now with that damosel?
<p/>Sir, said Sir Tristram, I wot not whither I shall ride but as the damosel will lead me. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall not ride with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady did never good, but ill.
<p/>Damosel, but if thou tell me anon for what cause thou leadest this knight with thee thou shalt die for it right anon
<p/>And then Sir Gawaine pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sword and said: : I know all your lady's treason, and yours. Mercy, Sir Gawaine, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, and if ye will save my life I will tell you.
<p/>Sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, Queen Morgan le Fay, my lady, hath ordained a thirty ladies to seek and espy after Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram, and by the trains of these ladies, who that may first meet any of these two knights they should turn them unto Morgan le Fay's castle, saying that they should do deeds of worship; and if any of the two knights came there, there be thirty knights lying and watching in a tower to wait upon Sir Launcelot or upon Sir Tristram.
<p/>Fie for shame, said Sir Gawaine, that ever such false treason should be wrought or used in a queen, and a king's sister, and a king and queen's daughter.
<p/>Say on, said Sir Gawaine, and thou shalt have thy life. CHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Tristram and Sir Gawaine rode to have foughten with the thirty knights, but they durst not come out.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Tristram, go ye to them, an it please you, and ye shall see I will not fail you, for it is not long ago since I and a fellow met with thirty knights of that queen's fellowship; and God speed us so that we may win worship.
<p/>So then Sir Gawaine and Sir Tristram rode toward the castle where Morgan le Fay was, and ever Sir Gawaine deemed well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was Sir Tristram de Liones, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) heard that two knights had slain and beaten thirty knights.
<p/>And when they came afore the castle Sir Gawaine spake on high and said: Queen Morgan le Fay, send out your knights that ye have laid in a watch for Sir Launcelot and for Sir Tristram.
<p/>Now, said Sir Gawaine, I know your false treason, and through all places where that I ride men shall know of your false treason; and now let see, said Sir Gawaine, whether ye dare come out of your castle, ye thirty knights.
<p/>SIR, said Sir Gawaine, will ye stand with me, and we will see the malice of these thirty knights. Then the queen spake and all the thirty knights at once, and said: Sir Gawaine, full well wottest thou
<p/>what thou dost and sayest; for by God we know thee passing well, but all that thou speakest and dost , thou sayest it upon pride of that good knight that is there with thee.
<p/>For there be some of us that know full well the hands of that knight over all well. And wit thou well
<p/>, Sir Gawaine, it is more for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) sake than for thine that we will not come out of this castle.
<p/>For wit ye well, Sir Gawaine, the knight that beareth the arms of Cornwall, we know him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) is.
<p/>Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Tristram departed and rode on their ways a day or two together; and there by adventure, they met with Sir Kay and Sir Sagramore
<p/>And then they were glad of Sir Gawaine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) of them, but they wist not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) was with the shield of Cornwall, but by deeming.
<p/>le Desirous. And thus they rode together a day or two. And then they were ware of Sir Breuse Saunce Pite chasing a lady for to have slain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) had slain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paramour afore.
<p/>Hold you all still, said Sir Gawaine, and show none of you forth, and ye shall see me reward yonder false knight
<p/>And then Sir Gawaine rode betwixt Sir Breuse and the lady, and said: False knight, leave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and have ado with me.
<p/>When Sir Breuse saw no more but Sir Gawaine he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) feutred his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) spear, and Sir Gawaine against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); and there Sir Breuse overthrew Sir Gawaine, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) rode over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>), and overthwart him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) twenty times to have destroyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>); and when Sir Tristram saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) do so villainous a deed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hurled out against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And when Sir Breuse saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) with the shield of Cornwall he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well that it was Sir Tristram, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fled, and Sir Tristram followed after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and Sir Breuse Saunce Pite was so horsed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way quite, and Sir Tristram followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) long, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would fain have been avenged upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had long chased him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw a fair well, and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode to repose him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and tied his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse till a tree.
<p/>; for an he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) espy you he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is so well horsed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) will escape away. CHAPTER XXVII. How damosel Bragwaine found Tristram sleeping by a well, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) delivered letters to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) from La Beale Isoud.
<p/>AND then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) helm and washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) visage and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hands, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell asleep. In the meanwhile came a damosel that had sought Sir Tristram many ways and days within this land.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) came to the well she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and had forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) as in remembrance of Sir Tristram, but by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), that hight Passe-Brewel that had been Sir Tristram's horse many years.
<p/>For when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was mad in the forest Sir Fergus kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>). So this lady, Dame Bragwaine, abode still till he (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) was awake.
<p/>So when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) wake she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again, for either knew other of old acquaintance; then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) long and broad, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fergus</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had letters from Queen La Beale Isoud.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram said: Lady Bragwaine, ye shall ride with me till that tournament be done at the Castle of Maidens, and then shall bear letters and tidings with you.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and sought lodging, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) met with a good ancient knight and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to lodge with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>Then anon Sir Tristram read them, and wit ye well he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was glad, for therein was many a piteous complaint. Right so came Gouvernail unto Sir Tristram, that was glad of that lady.
<p/>So this old knight's name was Sir Pellounes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) told of the great tournament that should be at the Castle of Maidens.
<p/>And right so there came one unto Sir Pellounes, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that Sir Persides de Bloise was come home; then that knight held up his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hands and thanked God of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) coming home.
<p/>And there Sir Launcelot and thirty-two knights of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) blood had ordained shields of Cornwall. And there Sir Pellounes told Sir Tristram that in two years he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had not seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) son, Sir Persides.
<p/>So on a time Sir Tristram and Sir Persides came to their lodging both at once, and so they unarmed them, and put upon them their clothing.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Tristram, I know your son well enough for a good knight. And then these two knights each welcomed other.
<p/>And there I jousted afore King Mark; and so it happed me at that time to overthrow ten knights, and then came to me Sir Tristram de Liones and overthrew me, and took my lady away from me, and that shall I never forget, but I shall remember me an ever I see my time.
<p/>And when Sir Persides understood that Sir Tristram was of Cornwall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was once in Cornwall: Ah, said Sir Tristram, now I understand that ye hate Sir Tristram.
<p/>Yes, said Sir Persides, I know well that Sir Tristram is a noble knight and a much better knight than I, yet
<p/>What deem ye, ween ye that Sir Tristram is not able to withstand your malice? shall I not owe him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) my good will.
<p/>Right as they stood thus talking at a bay-window of that castle, they saw many knights riding to and fro toward the tournament.
<p/>And then was Sir Tristram ware of a likely knight riding upon a great black horse, and a black-covered shield. What knight is that, said Sir Tristram, with the black horse and the black shield?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) seemeth a good knight. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well, said Sir Persides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is one of the best knights of the world.
<p/>Then is it Sir Launcelot, said Tristram. Nay, said Sir Persides, it is Sir Palomides, that is yet unchristened. CHAPTER XXVIII.
<p/>How Sir Tristram had a fall with Sir Palomides, and how Launcelot overthrew two knights. THEN they saw much people of the country salute Sir Palomides.
<p/>And within a while after there came a squire of the castle, that told Sir Pellounes that was lord of that castle, that a knight with a black shield had smitten down thirteen knights.
<p/>Fair brother, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides, let us cast upon us cloaks, and let us go see the play.
<p/>Not so, said Sir Persides, we will not go like knaves thither, but we will ride like men and good knights to withstand our enemies.
<p/>So they armed them, and took their horses and great spears, and thither they went thereas many knights assayed themself before the tournament.
<p/>And anon Sir Palomides saw Sir Persides, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sent a squire unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and said: Go thou to the yonder knight with the green shield and therein a lion of gold, and say him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) I require him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to joust with me, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that my name is Sir Palomides.
<p/>When Sir Persides understood that request of Sir Palomides, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ready, and there anon they met together, but Sir Persides had a fall.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to be revenged upon Sir Palomides, and that saw Sir Palomides that was ready and so was not Sir Tristram, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) at an advantage and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse's tail when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had no spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rest.
<p/>Then stert up Sir Tristram and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse lightly, and was wroth out of measure, and sore ashamed of that fall.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides by Gouvernail, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to joust with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) request. Nay, said Sir Palomides, as at this time I will not joust with that knight,
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be wroth he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) may right it to-morn at the Castle of Maidens, where he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) may see me and many other knights.
<p/>for I know him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) better than he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) weeneth. With that came Sir Dinadan, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw Sir Tristram wroth he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) list not to jape.
<p/>Lo, said Sir Dinadan, here may a man prove, be a man never so good yet may he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have a fall, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was never so wise
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be overseen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rideth well that never fell. So Sir Tristram was passing wroth, and said to Sir Persides and to Sir Dinadan: I will revenge me.
<p/>Right so as they stood talking there, there came by Sir Tristram a likely knight riding passing soberly and heavily with a black shield.
<p/>What knight is that? said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) well, said Sir Persides, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name is Sir Briant of North Wales;
<p/>And there came in Sir Launcelot du Lake with a shield of the arms of Cornwall, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sent a squire unto Sir Briant, and required him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to joust with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) passed on among other knights of North Wales. Well, said Sir Briant, sithen I am required to joust I will do what I may; and there Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Briant from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse a great fall.
<p/>Whatsoever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) be, said Sir Dinadan, I warrant you he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is of King Ban's blood, the which be knights of the most noble prowess in the world, for to account so many for so many.
<p/>Then there came two knights of Northgalis, that one hight Hew de la Montaine, and the other Sir Madok de la Montaine, and they challenged Sir Launcelot foot-hot.
<p/>Sir Launcelot not refusing them but made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ready, with one spear he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote them down both over their horses' croups; and so Sir Launcelot rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way.
<p/>By the good lord, said Sir Tristram, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) is a good knight that beareth the shield of Cornwall, and meseemeth he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rideth in the best manner that ever I saw knight ride.
<p/>Then the King of Northgalis rode unto Sir Palomides and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) heartily for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sake to joust with that knight that hath done us of Northgalis despite.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Palomides, I am full loath to have ado with that knight, and cause why is, for as to-morn the great tournament shall be; and therefore I will keep myself fresh by my will.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram marvelled what knight he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was that bare the shield of Cornwall. Nay, said the King of Northgalis, I pray you require him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) of jousts.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Palomides, I will joust at your request, and require that knight to joust with me, and often I have seen a man have a fall at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own request.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIX. How Sir Launcelot jousted with Palomides and overthrew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was assailed with twelve knights. THEN Sir Palomides sent unto Sir Launcelot a squire, and required him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) of jousts.
<p/>Fair fellow, said Sir Launcelot, tell me thy lord's name. Sir, said the squire, my lord's name is Sir Palomides, the good knight.
<p/>In good hour, said Sir Launcelot, for there is no knight that I saw this seven years that I had liefer ado withal than with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And so either knights made them ready with two great spears. Nay, said Sir Dinadan, ye shall see that Sir Palomides will quit him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) right well.
<p/>It may be so, said Sir Tristram, but I undertake that knight with the shield of Cornwall shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) a fall.
<p/>so they spurred their horses and feutred their spears, and either hit other, and Sir Palomides brake a spear upon Sir Launcelot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sat and moved not; but Sir Launcelot smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) so lightly that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse to avoid the saddle, and the stroke brake his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield and the hauberk, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) not fallen he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had been slain.
<p/>How now, said Sir Tristram, I wist well by the manner of their riding both that Sir Palomides should have a fall.
<p/>Right so Sir Launcelot rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way, and rode to a well to drink and to repose him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and they of Northgalis espied him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode; and then there followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) twelve knights for to have mischieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), for this cause that upon the morn at the tournament of the Castle of Maidens that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should not win the victory.
<p/>So they came upon Sir Launcelot suddenly, and unnethe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) helm and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, but they were in hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and then Sir Launcelot gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear, and rode through them, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) slew a knight and brake a spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) body.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword and smote upon the right hand and upon the left hand, so that within a few strokes he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had slain other three knights, and the remnant that abode he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wounded them sore all that did abide.
<p/>Thus Sir Launcelot escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) enemies of North Wales, and then Sir Launcelot rode his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) way till a friend, and lodged him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) till on the morn; for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would not the first day have ado in the tournament because of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) great labour.
<p/>And on the first day he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was with King Arthur thereas he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was set on high upon a scaffold to discern who was best worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) deeds.
<p/>I believe it not, said Sir Dinadan. Right So Sir Launcelot was with King Arthur, and jousted not the first day.
<p/>NOW turn we unto Sir Tristram de Liones, that commanded Gouvernail, his (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) servant, to ordain him (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) a black shield with none other remembrance therein.
<p/>And so Sir Persides and Sir Tristram departed from their host Sir Pellounes, and they rode early toward the tournament, and then they drew them to King Carados' side, of Scotland; and anon knights began the field what of King Northgalis' part, and what of King Carados' part, and there began great party.
<p/>CHAPTER XXX. How Sir Tristram behaved him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the first day of the tournament, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had the prize. Then there was hurling and rashing.
<p/>Right so came in Sir Persides and Sir Tristram and so they did fare that they put the King of Northgalis aback.
<p/>Then came in Sir Bleoberis de Ganis and Sir Gaheris with them of Northgalis, and then was Sir Persides smitten down and almost slain, for more than forty horse men went over him (<font color='blue'><b>Ganis</b></font>).
<p/>For Sir Bleoberis did great deeds of arms, and Sir Gaheris failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) not. When Sir Tristram beheld them, and saw them do such deeds of arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) marvelled what they were.
<p/>Also Sir Tristram thought shame that Sir Persides was so done to; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gat a great spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode to Sir Gaheris and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse.
<p/>And then was Sir Bleoberis wroth, and gat a spear and rode against Sir Tristram in great ire; and there Sir Tristram met with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and smote Sir Bleoberis from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) horse
<p/>So then the King with the Hundred Knights was wroth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horsed Sir Bleoberis and Sir Gaheris again, and there began a great medley; and ever Sir Tristram held them passing short, and ever Sir Bleoberis was passing busy upon Sir Tristram; and there came Sir Dinadan against Sir Tristram, and Sir Tristram gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) such a buffet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) swooned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saddle.
<p/>Then anon Sir Dinadan came to Sir Tristram and said: Sir, I know thee better than thou weenest; but here I promise thee my troth I will never come against thee more, for I promise thee that sword of thine shall never come on mine helm.
<p/>With that came Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Tristram gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) such a buffet that down he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) so sore by the helm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse's feet.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram departed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) pavilion, and Sir Dinadan rode with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and Sir Persides and King Arthur then, and the kings upon both parties, marvelled what knight that was with the black shield.
<p/>And then King Arthur blew to lodging. Many said their advice, and some knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) for Sir Tristram, and held their peace and would nought say.
<p/>So that first day King Arthur, and all the kings and lords that were judges, gave Sir Tristram the prize; howbeit they knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) not, but named him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the Knight with the Black Shield.
<p/>THEN upon the morn Sir Palomides returned from the King of Northgalis, and rode to King Arthur's side, where was King Carados, and the King of Ireland, and Sir Launcelot's kin, and Sir Gawaine's kin.
<p/>So Sir Palomides sent the damosel unto Sir Tristram that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sent to seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) mind in the forest, and this damosel asked Sir Tristram what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was and what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) name?
<p/>As for that, said Sir Tristram, tell Sir Palomides ye shall not wit as at this time unto the time I have broken two spears upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>But let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wit thus much, said Sir Tristram, that I am the same knight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote down in over-evening-LSB-*10-RSB- at the tournament; and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) plainly on what party that Sir Palomides be I will be of the contrary party.
<p/>Sir, said the damosel, ye shall understand that Sir Palomides will be on King Arthur's side, where the most noble knights of the world be.
<p/>In the name of God, said Sir Tristram, then will I be with the King of Northgalis, because Sir Palomides will be on King Arthur's side, and else I would not but for his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sake.
<p/>So when King Arthur was come they blew unto the field; and then there began a great party, and so King Carados jousted with the King of the Hundred Knights, and there King Carados had a fall:
<p/>then was there hurling and rushing, and right so came in knights of King Arthur's, and they bare aback the King of Northgalis' knights.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Tristram returned against King Arthur's party because he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) saw Sir Palomides on that party. -LSB-*10-RSB- <div class="bookquote">``the evening afore,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>W. de W. Then Sir Tristram came in, and began so roughly and so bigly that there was none might withstand him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and thus Sir Tristram dured long.
<p/>And at the last Sir Tristram fell among the fellowship of King Ban, and there fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Blamore de Ganis, and many other knights.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram smote on the right hand and on the left hand, that all lords and ladies spake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) noble deeds.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellowship and rescued Sir Tristram, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) away from those knights that bare the shields of Cornwall.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram saw another fellowship by themself, and there were a forty knights together, and Sir Kay, the Seneschal, was their governor.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram rode in amongst them, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote down Sir Kay from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fared among those knights like a greyhound among conies.
<p/>But at the last Sir Tristram should have had the worse had not the King with the Hundred Knights been. Then Sir Launcelot found a knight that was sore wounded upon the head.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said, a knight that beareth a black shield, and I may curse the time that ever I met with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is a devil and no man.
<p/>So Sir Launcelot departed from him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and thought to meet with Sir Tristram, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword drawn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand to seek Sir Tristram; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) espied him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hurled here and there, and at every stroke Sir Tristram wellnigh smote down a knight.
<p/>O mercy Jesu! said the king, sith the times I bare arms saw I never no knight do so marvellous deeds of arms.
<p/>And if I should set upon this knight, said Sir Launcelot to himself, I did shame to myself, and therewithal Sir Launcelot put up his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword.
<p/>And then the King with the Hundred Knights and an hundred more of North Wales set upon the twenty of Sir Launcelot's kin: and they twenty knights held them ever together as wild swine, and none would fail other.
<p/>And so when Sir Tristram beheld the noblesse or these twenty knights he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) marvelled of their good deeds, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw by their fare and by their rule that they had liefer die than avoid the field.
<p/>Now Jesu, said Sir Tristram, well may he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) be valiant and full of prowess that hath such a sort of noble knights unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) kin, and full like is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to be a noble man that is their leader and governor.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Launcelot, who wounded you so sore? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) meant it by Sir Launcelot du Lake. So when Sir Tristram had beholden them long he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thought shame to see two hundred knights battering upon twenty knights.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram rode unto the King with the Hundred Knights and said: Sir, leave your fighting with those twenty knights, for ye win no worship of them, ye be so many and they so few; and wit ye well they will not out of the field I see by their cheer and countenance; and worship get ye none an ye slay them.
<p/>Therefore leave your fighting with them, for I to increase my worship I will ride to the twenty knights and help them with all my might and power.
<p/>; now I see your courage and courtesy I will withdraw my knights for your pleasure, for evermore a good knight will favour another, and like will draw to like.
<p/>Nay, said the King with the Hundred Knights, ye shall not do so CHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Tristram found Palomides by a well, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lodging.
<p/>And all this while, and long to-fore, Sir Launcelot had watched upon Sir Tristram with a very purpose to have fellowshipped with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>And then suddenly Sir Tristram, Sir Dinadan, and Gouvernail, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) man, rode their way into the forest, that no man perceived where they went.
<p/>So then King Arthur blew unto lodging, and gave the King of Northgalis the prize because Sir Tristram was upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) side.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot rode here and there, so wood as lion that fauted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fill, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had lost Sir Tristram, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) returned unto King Arthur.
<p/>And then in all the field was a noise that with the wind it might be heard two mile thence, how the lords and ladies cried:
<p/>THEN the King with the Hundred Knights withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knights. The Knight with the Black Shield hath won the field. Alas, said King Arthur, where is that knight become?
<p/>It is shame to all those in the field so to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) escape away from you; but with gentleness and courtesy ye might have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) unto me to the Castle of Maidens.
<p/>Then the noble King Arthur went unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights and comforted them in the best wise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could, and said: My fair fellows, be not dismayed, howbeit ye have lost the field this day.
<p/>And many were hurt and sore wounded, and many were whole. My fellows, said King Arthur, look that ye be of good cheer, for to-morn
<p/>I will be in the field with you and revenge you of your enemies. So that night King Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knights reposed themself.
<p/>The damosel that came from La Beale Isoud unto Sir Tristram, all the while the tournament was a-doing she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) was with Queen Guenever, and ever the queen asked her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) for what cause she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) came into that country.
<p/>Madam, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) answered, I come for none other cause but from my lady La Beale Isoud to wit of your welfare.
<p/>For in no wise she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) would not tell the queen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) came for Sir Tristram's sake. So this lady, Dame Bragwaine, took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) leave of Queen Guenever, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode after Sir Tristram.
<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode through the forest she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heard a great cry; then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) squire to go into the forest to wit what was that noise.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came to a well, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found a knight bounden till a tree crying as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had been wood, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) harness standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) espied that squire, therewith he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) abraid and brake himself loose, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, and ran to have slain the squire.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and fled all that ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might unto Dame Bragwaine, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) adventure.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rode unto Sir Tristram's pavilion, and told Sir Tristram what adventure she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had found in the forest. Alas, said Sir Tristram, upon my head there is some good knight at mischief.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword and rode thither, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) heard how the knight complained unto himself and said: I, woful knight Sir Palomides, what misadventure befalleth me, that thus am defoiled with falsehood and treason, through Sir Bors and Sir Ector.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) hands, and made many strange signs and tokens; and so through his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) raging he (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) sword into that fountain.
<p/>Alas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) said, why live I so long! Then Sir Palomides wailed and wrang his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) hands. And at the last for pure sorrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) ran into that fountain, over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) belly, and sought after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bors</b></font>) sword.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram saw that, and ran upon Sir Palomides, and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) arms fast. What art thou, said Palomides, that holdeth me
<p/>so? I am a man of this forest that would thee none harm. Alas, said Sir Palomides, I may never win worship where Sir Tristram is; for ever where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an
<p/>, then get I no worship; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be away for the most part I have the gree, unless that Sir Launcelot be there or Sir Lamorak.
<p/>Then Sir Palomides said: Once in Ireland Sir Tristram put me to the worse, and another time in Cornwall, and in other places in this land.
<p/>I would fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>), said Sir Palomides, and ease my heart upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamorak</b></font>); and yet, to say thee sooth, Sir Tristram is the gentlest knight in this world living.
<p/>I be there What would ye do, said Sir Tristram, an ye had Sir Tristram? What will ye do, said Sir Tristram, will ye go with me to your lodging?
<p/>Nay, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), I will go to the King with the Hundred Knights, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rescued me from Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Ector and else had I been slain traitorly.
<p/>Sir Tristram said him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) such kind words that Sir Palomides went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lodging. Then Gouvernail went to-fore, and charged Dame Bragwaine to go out of the way to her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) lodging And bid
<p/>And so they rode together till they came to Sir Tristram's pavilion, and there Sir Palomides had all the cheer that might be had all that night.
<p/>But in no wise Sir Palomides might not know what was Sir Tristram; and so after supper they yede to rest, and Sir Tristram for great travail slept till it was day.
<p/>And Sir Palomides might not sleep for anguish; and in the dawning of the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse privily, and rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way unto Sir Gaheris and unto Sir Sagramore le Desirous, where they were in their pavilions; for they three were fellows at the beginning of the tournament.
<p/>ye Sir Persides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) no quarrels. And then upon the morn the king blew unto the tournament upon the third day.
<p/>SO the King of Northgalis and the King with the Hundred Knights, they two encountered with King Carados and with the King of Ireland; and there the King with the Hundred Knights smote down King Carados, and the King of Northgalis smote down the King of Ireland.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) jousted with King Arthur, and other feats. With that came in Sir Palomides, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) came he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) made great work, for by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) indented shield
<p/>So came in King Arthur, and did great deeds of arms together, and put the King of Northgalis and the King with the Hundred Knights to the worse.
<p/>With this came in Sir Tristram with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) black shield, and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) jousted with Sir Palomides, and there by fine force Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse's croup.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was well known. Then King Arthur cried: Knight with the Black Shield, make thee ready to me, and in the same wise Sir Tristram smote King Arthur.
<p/>Then King Arthur with a great eager heart he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) gat a spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand, and there upon the one side he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) smote Sir Tristram over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse.
<p/>And then by force of King Arthur's knights the King and Sir Palomides were horsed again. Then foot-hot Sir Palomides came upon Sir Tristram, as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was upon foot, to have overridden him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>Then Sir Tristram was ware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) stooped aside, and with great ire he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gat him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) by the arm, and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse.
<p/>Then Sir Palomides lightly arose, and then they dashed together mightily with their swords; and many kings, queens, and lords, stood and beheld them.
<p/>And at the last Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides upon the helm three mighty strokes, and at every stroke that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said: This for Sir Tristram's sake. With that Sir Palomides fell to the earth grovelling. Then came the King with the Hundred Knights, and brought Sir Tristram an horse, and so was he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) horsed again.
<p/>By then was Sir Palomides horsed, and with great ire he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) jousted upon Sir Tristram with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear as it was in the rest, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a great dash with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear, and gat him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) by the neck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) both hands, and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) clean out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saddle, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bare him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
<p/>afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the length of ten spears, and then in the presence of them all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fall at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) adventure.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram was ware of King Arthur with a naked sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spear Sir Tristram ran upon King Arthur; and then King Arthur boldly abode him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sword he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) smote a-two his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spear, and therewithal Sir Tristram stonied; and so King Arthur gave him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) three or four strokes or he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) might get out his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sword, and at the last Sir Tristram drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword and -LSB-either-RSB- assailed other passing hard.
<p/>With that the great press departed -LSB-them-RSB-. Then Sir Tristram rode here and there and did his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) great pain, that eleven of the good knights of the blood of King Ban, that was of Sir Launcelot's kin, that day Sir Tristram smote down; that all the estates marvelled of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) great deeds and all cried upon the Knight with the Black Shield.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Launcelot hurt Sir Tristram, and how after Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides. THEN this cry was so large that Sir Launcelot heard it.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gat a great spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand and came towards the cry. Then Sir Launcelot cried: The Knight with the Black Shield, make thee ready to joust with me.
<p/>When Sir Tristram heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) say so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, and either abashed down their heads, and came together as thunder; and Sir Tristram's spear brake in pieces, and Sir Launcelot by malfortune struck Sir Tristram on the side a deep wound nigh to the death; but yet Sir Tristram avoided not his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saddle, and so the spear brake.
<p/>Therewithal Sir Tristram that was wounded gat out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rushed to Sir Launcelot, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) three great strokes upon the helm that the fire sprang thereout, and Sir Launcelot abashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head lowly toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saddle-bow.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Tristram departed from the field, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) so wounded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) weened he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should have died; and Sir Dinadan espied him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) into the forest.
<p/>So when Sir Tristram was departed by the forest's side he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) alighted, and unlaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) harness and freshed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wound; then weened Sir Dinadan that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should have died.
<p/>Nay, nay, said Sir Tristram, Dinadan never dread thee, for I am heart-whole, and of this wound I shall soon be whole, by the mercy of God.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot abode and did many marvellous deeds. By that Sir Dinadan was ware where came Palomides riding straight upon them.
<p/>And so Sir Dinadan gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) warning, and said: Sir Tristram, my lord, ye are so sore wounded that ye may not have ado with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), therefore I will ride against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and do to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) what I may, and if I be slain ye may pray for my soul; and in the meanwhile ye may withdraw you and go into the castle, or in the forest, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shall not meet with you.
<p/>Sir Tristram smiled and said: I thank you, Sir Dinadan, of your good will, but ye shall wit that I am able to handle him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And then anon hastily he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and a great spear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand, and said to Sir Dinadan: Adieu; and rode toward Sir Palomides a soft pace.
<p/>Then when Sir Palomides saw that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) made countenance to amend his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did it for this cause, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) abode Sir Gaheris that came after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And then Sir Tristram was ware that Sir Palomides came to have destroyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was come he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode toward Sir Tristram.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides, and required him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to joust with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote down Sir Palomides he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would do no more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and if it so happened that Sir Palomides smote down Sir Tristram, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) do his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) utterance.
<p/>Then they met together, and Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had a grievous fall, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lay still as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had been dead.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram ran upon Sir Gaheris, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would not have jousted; but whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would or not Sir Tristram smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse's croup, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lay still as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had been dead.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) way and left Sir Persides' squire within the pavilions, and Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to an old knight's place to lodge them.
<p/>So they were accorded. And that old knight had five sons at the tournament, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) prayed God heartily for their coming home.
<p/>And when Sir Tristram departed into the forest Sir Launcelot held alway the stour like hard, as a man araged that took no heed to himself, and wit
<p/>And so, as the French book saith, they came home all five well beaten. ye well there was many a noble knight against him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And when King Arthur saw Sir Launcelot do so marvellous deeds of arms he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) then armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) armour, and rode into the field to help Sir Launcelot; and so many knights came in with King Arthur.
<p/>And to make short tale in conclusion, the King of Northgalis and the King of the Hundred Knights were put to the worse; and because Sir Launcelot abode and was the last in the field the prize was given him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).
<p/>But Sir Launcelot would neither for king, queen, nor knight, have the prize, but where the cry was cried through the field: Sir Launcelot, Sir Launcelot hath won the field this day, Sir Launcelot let make another cry contrary: Sir Tristram hath won the field, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) began first, and last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hath endured, and so hath he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) done the first day, the second, and the third day.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXV. How the prize of the third day was given to Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot gave it to Sir Tristram.
<p/>THEN all the estates and degrees high and low said of Sir Launcelot great worship, for the honour that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did unto Sir Tristram; and for that honour doing to Sir Tristram he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was at that time more praised and renowned than an he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had overthrown five hundred knights; and all the people wholly for this gentleness, first the estates both high and low, and after the commonalty cried at once: Sir Launcelot hath won the field whosoever say nay.
<p/>Then was Sir Launcelot wroth and ashamed, and so therewithal he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode to King Arthur. Alas, said the king, we are all dismayed that Sir Tristram is thus departed from us.
<p/>By God, said King Arthur, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is one of the noblest knights that ever I saw hold spear or sword in hand, and the most courteoust knight in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fighting; for full hard I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), said King Arthur, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) smote Sir Palomides upon the helm thrice, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) abashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) helm with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) strokes, and also he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said: Here is a stroke for Sir Tristram, and thus thrice he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said.
<p/>Then King Arthur, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Dodinas le Savage took their horses to seek Sir Tristram, and by the means of Sir Persides he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had told King Arthur where Sir Tristram was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) pavilion.
<p/>Then King Arthur and Sir Launcelot were heavy, and returned again to the Castle of Maidens making great dole for the hurt of Sir Tristram, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sudden departing.
<p/>So God me help, said King Arthur, I am more heavy that I cannot meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) than for all the hurts that all my knights have had at the tournament.
<p/>Right so came Sir Gaheris and told King Arthur how Sir Tristram had smitten down Sir Palomides, and it was at Sir Palomides' own request.
<p/>Alas, said King Arthur, that was great dishonour to Sir Palomides, inasmuch as Sir Tristram was sore wounded, and now may we all, kings, and knights, and men of worship, say that Sir Tristram may be called a noble knight, and one of the best knights that ever I saw the days of my life.
<p/>For I will that ye all, kings and knights, know, said King Arthur, that I never saw knight do so marvellously as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hath done these three days; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was the first that began and that longest held on, save this last day.
<p/>And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was hurt, it was a manly adventure of two noble knights, and when two noble men encounter needs must the one have the worse, like as God will suffer at that time.
<p/>As for me, said Sir Launcelot, for all the lands that ever my father left me I would not have hurt Sir Tristram an
<p/>But when they came there, Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan were gone. I had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) at that time; that I hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was for I saw not his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield.
<p/>For an I had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) black shield, I would not have meddled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) for many causes; for late he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did as much for me as ever did knight, and that is well known that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had ado with thirty knights, and no help save Sir Dinadan.
<p/>And one thing shall I promise, said Sir Launcelot, Sir Palomides shall repent it as in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) unkindly dealing for to follow that noble knight that I by mishap hurted thus.
<p/>Sir Launcelot said all the worship that might be said by Sir Tristram. Then King Arthur made a great feast to all that would come.
<p/>And thus we let pass King Arthur, and a little we will turn unto Sir Palomides, that after he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had a fall of Sir Tristram, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was nigh-hand araged out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wit for despite of Sir Tristram.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came by a river, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) woodness he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse to have leapt over; and the horse failed footing and fell in the river, wherefore Sir Palomides was adread lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should have been drowned; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse, and swam to the land, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse go down by adventure.
<p/>How Palomides came to the castle where Sir Tristram was, and of the quest that Sir Launcelot and ten knights made for Sir Tristram.
<p/>AND when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came to the land he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) harness, and sat roaring and crying as a man out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Right so came a damosel even by Sir Palomides, that was sent from Sir Gawaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) brother unto Sir Mordred, that lay sick in the same place with that old knight where Sir Tristram was.
<p/>For, as the French book saith, Sir Persides hurt so Sir Mordred a ten days afore; and had it hot been for the love of Sir Gawaine and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) brother, Sir Persides had slain Sir Mordred.
<p/>And so this damosel came by Sir Palomides, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) had language together, the which pleased neither of them; and so the damosel rode her (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) ways till she (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) came to the old knight's place, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) told that old knight how she (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) met with the woodest knight by adventure that ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gawaine</b></font>) met withal.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) by adventure. CHAPTER XXXVI. What bare he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield? said Sir Tristram. It was indented with white and black, said the damosel.
<p/>Ah, said Sir Tristram, that was Sir Palomides, the good knight. For well I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), said Sir Tristram, for one of the best knights living in this realm.
<p/>Then that old knight took a little hackney, and rode for Sir Palomides, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) unto his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own manor; and full well knew Sir Tristram Sir Palomides, but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said but little, for at that time Sir Tristram was walking upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) feet, and well amended of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hurts; and always when Sir Palomides saw Sir Tristram he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would behold him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) full marvellously, and ever him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>Then would he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) say unto Sir Dinadan: An ever I may meet with Sir Tristram he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shall not escape mine hands.
<p/>I marvel, said Sir Dinadan, that ye boast behind Sir Tristram, for it is but late that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was in your hands, and ye in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hands; why would ye not hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) when ye had him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)?
<p/>for I saw myself twice or thrice that ye gat but little worship of Sir Tristram. Then was Sir Palomides ashamed.
<p/>Now shall we speak of King Arthur, that said to Sir Launcelot: Had not ye been we had not lost Sir Tristram, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was here daily unto the time ye met with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and in an evil time, said Arthur, ye encountered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).
<p/>My lord Arthur, said Launcelot, ye put upon me that I should be cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) departition; God knoweth it was against my will.
<p/>So leave we them a little while in the old castle with the old knight Sir Darras. But when men be hot in deeds of arms oft they hurt their friends as well as their foes.
<p/>And my lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye shall understand that Sir Tristram is a man that I am loath to offend, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hath done for me more than ever I did for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) as yet.
<p/>But then Sir Launcelot made bring forth a book: and then Sir Launcelot said: Here we are ten knights that will swear upon a book never to rest one night where we rest another this twelvemonth until that we find Sir Tristram.
<p/>And as for me, said Sir Launcelot, I promise you upon this book that an I may meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), either with fairness or foulness I shall bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to this court, or else I shall die therefore.
<p/>And the names of these ten knights that had undertaken this quest were these following: First was Sir Launcelot, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Bleoberis, and Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Lucan the Butler, Sir Uwaine, Sir Galihud Lionel, and Galiodin.
<p/>So these ten noble knights departed from the court of King Arthur, and so they rode upon their quest together until they came to a cross where departed four ways, and there departed the fellowship in four to seek Sir Tristram.
<p/>And as Sir Launcelot rode by adventure he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) met with Dame Bragwaine that was sent into that country to seek Sir Tristram, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bragwaine</b></font>) fled as fast as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bragwaine</b></font>) palfrey might go.
<p/>So Sir Launcelot met with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bragwaine</b></font>) and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bragwaine</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Bragwaine</b></font>) fled. Ah, fair knight, said Dame Bragwaine, I flee for dread of my life, for here followeth me
<p/>Then when Sir Launcelot saw Sir Breuse Saunce Pite, Sir Launcelot cried unto him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and said: False knight destroyer of ladies and damosels, now thy last days be come.
<p/>When Sir Breuse Saunce Pite saw Sir Launcelot's shield he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) knew it well, for at that time he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bare not the arms of Cornwall, but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bare his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own shield.
<p/>Sir Breuse Saunce Pite to slay me. Hold you nigh me, said Sir Launcelot. And then Sir Breuse fled, and Sir Launcelot followed after him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>But Sir Breuse was so well horsed that when him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) list to flee he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might well flee, and also abide when him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) list.
<p/>And then Sir Launcelot returned unto Dame Bragwaine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) great labour. CHAPTER XXXVII. How Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan were taken and put in prison.
<p/>NOW will we speak of Sir Lucan the butler, that by fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) came riding to the same place thereas was Sir Tristram, and in he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came in none other intent but to ask harbour.
<p/>Then the porter asked what was his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) name. Tell your lord that my name is Sir Lucan, the butler, a Knight of the Round Table.
<p/>Nay, nay, said Sir Daname, that was nephew to Sir Darras, say him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) shall not be lodged here, but let him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) wit that I, Sir Daname, will meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) anon, and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) make him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) ready.
<p/>So Sir Daname came forth on horseback, and there they met together with spears, and Sir Lucan smote down Sir Daname over his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>) horse's croup, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>) fled into that place, and Sir Lucan rode after him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>), and asked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>) many times.
<p/>So the porter went unto Sir Darras, lord of the place, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) who was there to ask harbour. Then Sir Dinadan said to Sir Tristram: It is shame to see the lord's cousin of this place defoiled.
<p/>And in the meanwhile Sir Dinadan was on horseback, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) jousted with Lucan the butler, and there Sir Lucan smote Dinadan through the thick of the thigh, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>) rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>) way; and Sir Tristram was wroth that Sir Dinadan was hurt, and followed after, and thought to avenge him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); and within a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) overtook Sir Lucan, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>) turn; and so they met together so that Sir Tristram hurt Sir Lucan passing sore and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a fall.
<p/>With that came Sir Uwaine, a gentle knight, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw Sir Lucan so hurt he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>) called Sir Tristram to joust with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>).
<p/>Abide, said Sir Tristram, and I shall redress it. Fair knight, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name I require you.
<p/>Sir knight, wit ye well my name is Sir Uwaine le Fise de Roy Ureine. Ah, said Sir Tristram, by my will
<p/>I would not have ado with you at no time. Ye shall not so, said Sir Uwaine, but ye shall have ado with me.
<p/>And then Sir Tristram saw none other bote, but rode against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and overthrew Sir Uwaine and hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in the side, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) departed unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lodging again.
<p/>And when Sir Dinadan understood that Sir Tristram had hurt Sir Lucan he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would have ridden after Sir Lucan for to have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucan</b></font>), but Sir Tristram would not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>Then Sir Uwaine let ordain an horse litter, and brought Sir Lucan to the abbey of Ganis, and the castle thereby hight the Castle of Ganis, of the which
<p/>Sir Bleoberis was lord. And at that castle Sir Launcelot promised all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bleoberis</b></font>) fellows to meet in the quest of Sir Tristram.
<p/>So when Sir Tristram was come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lodging there came a damosel that told Sir Darras that three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sons were slain at that tournament, and two grievously wounded that they were never like to help themself.
<p/>And all this was done by a noble knight that bare the black shield, and that was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that bare the prize.
<p/>Then came there one and told Sir Darras that the same knight was within, him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that bare the black shield. Then Sir Darras yede unto Sir Tristram's chamber, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shield and showed it to the damosel.
<p/>Then without any tarrying Sir Darras put Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan, within a strong prison, and there Sir Tristram was like to have died of great sickness; and every day Sir Palomides would reprove Sir Tristram of old hate betwixt them.
<p/>Ah sir, said the damosel, that same is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that slew your three sons. And ever Sir Tristram spake fair and said little.
<p/>But when Sir Palomides saw the falling of sickness of Sir Tristram, then was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) heavy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in all the best wise he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) could.
<p/>And as the French book saith, there came forty knights to Sir Darras that were of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) own kin, and they would have slain Sir Tristram and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) two fellows, but Sir Darras would not suffer that, but kept them in prison, and meat and drink they had.
<p/>So Sir Tristram endured there great pain, for sickness had undertaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and that is the greatest pain a prisoner may have.
<p/>For all the while a prisoner may have his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) health of body he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) may endure under the mercy of God and in hope of good deliverance; but when sickness toucheth a prisoner's body, then may a prisoner say all wealth is him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) bereft, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hath cause to wail and to weep.
<p/>Right so did Sir Tristram when sickness had undertaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), for then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took such sorrow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had almost slain himself.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII. How King Mark was sorry for the good renown of Sir Tristram. Some of King Arthur's knights jousted with knights of Cornwall.
<p/>NOW will we speak, and leave Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan in prison, and speak we of other knights that sought after Sir Tristram
<p/>And some yede into Cornwall; and by adventure Sir Gaheris, nephew unto King Arthur, came unto King Mark, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was well received and sat at King Mark's own table and ate of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) own mess.
<p/>many divers parts of this land. Then King Mark asked Sir Gaheris what tidings there were in the realm of Logris.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Gaheris, the king reigneth as a noble knight; and now but late there was a great jousts and tournament
<p/>But there was one knight that did marvellously three days, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bare a black shield, and of all knights that ever I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) proved the best knight.
<p/>as ever I saw any in the realm of Logris, and the most noble knights were at that jousts. Then, said King Mark, that was Sir Launcelot, or Sir Palomides the paynim.
<p/>Not so, said Sir Gheris, for both Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides were on the contrary party against the Knight with the Black Shield.
<p/>And therewithal the king smote down his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) head, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) feared sore that Sir Tristram should get him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) such worship in the realm of Logris wherethrough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) himself should not be able to withstand him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>Thus Sir Gaheris had great cheer with King Mark, and with Queen La Beale Isoud, the which was glad of Sir Gaheris' words; for well she (<font color='blue'><b>Isoud</b></font>) wist by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) deeds and manners that it was Sir Tristram.
<p/>And then the king made a feast royal, and to that feast came Sir Uwaine le Fise de Roy Ureine, and some called him (<font color='blue'><b>Roy</b></font>) Uwaine le Blanchemains.
<p/>Then was it Sir Tristram, said the king. Yea, said Sir Gaheris. And this Sir Uwaine challenged all the knights of Cornwall.
<p/>Then was the king wood wroth that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had no knights to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). Then Sir Andred, nephew unto King Mark, leapt up and said: I will encounter with Sir Uwaine.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) yede and armed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and horsed him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) in the best manner. And there Sir Uwaine met with Sir Andred, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) down that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) swooned on the earth.
<p/>Then was King Mark sorry and wroth out of measure that he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had no knight to revenge his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) nephew, Sir Andred.
<p/>So the king called unto him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sake to take upon him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to joust with Sir Uwaine.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Dinas, I am full loath to have ado with any knight of the Round Table. Yet, said the king, for my love take upon thee to joust.
<p/>So Sir Dinas made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ready, and anon they encountered together with great spears, but Sir Dinas was overthrown, horse and man, a great fall.
<p/>Who was wroth but King Mark! Alas, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said, have I no knight that will encounter with yonder knight? Sir, said Sir Gaheris, for your sake I will joust.
<p/>So Sir Gaheris made him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) ready, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was armed he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rode into the field. And when Sir Uwaine saw Sir Gaheris' shield he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) rode to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) and said:
<p/>For, sir, the first time ye were made Knight of the Round Table ye sware that ye should not have ado with your fellowship wittingly.
<p/>And pardie, Sir Gaheris, ye knew me well enough by my shield, and so do I know you by your shield, and though ye would break your oath I would not break mine; for there is not one here, nor ye, that shall think I am afeard of you,
<p/>Sir, ye do not your part. but I durst right well have ado with you, and yet we be sisters' sons.
<p/>Then was Sir Gaheris ashamed, and so therewithal every knight went their way, and Sir Uwaine rode into the country. Then King Mark armed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) horse and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) spear, with a squire with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) rode afore Sir Uwaine, and suddenly at a gap he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) ran upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) that was not ware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) almost through the body, and there left him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>).
<p/>I wot not, said Sir Uwaine, why nor wherefore, but by treason I am sure I gat this hurt; for here came a knight suddenly upon me or that I was ware, and suddenly hurt me.
<p/>So within a while there came Sir Kay and found Sir Uwaine, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was hurt. Then there was come Sir Andred to seek King Mark.
<p/>Thou traitor knight, said Sir Kay, an I wist it were thou that thus traitorly hast hurt this noble knight thou shouldst never pass my hands.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Andred, I did never hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and that I will report me to himself. Fie on you false knight, said Sir Kay, for ye of Cornwall are nought worth.
<p/>And then Sir Gaheris took his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) leave of King Mark, but or he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) departed he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) said: Sir king, ye did a foul shame unto you and your court, when ye banished Sir Tristram out of this country, for ye needed not to have doubted no knight an he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had been here.
<p/>So Sir Kay made carry Sir Uwaine to the Abbey of the Black Cross, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was healed. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) departed.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX. Of the treason of King Mark, and how Sir Gaheris smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) down and Andred his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) cousin. THEN there came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, unto King Mark, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had good cheer showing outward.
<p/>Now, fair lords, said he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), will ye prove any adventure in the forest of Morris, in the which I know well is as hard an adventure as I know any.
<p/>And Sir Gaheris said he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) would be avised for King Mark was ever full of treason: and therewithal Sir Gaheris departed and rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) way.
<p/>And by the same way that Sir Kay should ride he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) down to rest, charging his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) squire to wait upon Sir Kay; And warn me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) cometh.
<p/>So within a while Sir Kay came riding that way, and then Sir Gaheris took his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse and met him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and said: Sir Kay, ye are not wise to ride at the request of King Mark, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) dealeth all with treason.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Kay, I will prove it. Then said Sir Kay: I require you let us prove this adventure. I shall not fail you, said Sir Gaheris.
<p/>And so they rode that time till a lake that was that time called the Perilous Lake, and there they abode under the shaw of the wood.
<p/>The meanwhile King Mark within the castle of Tintagil avoided all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) barons, and all other save such as were privy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) were avoided out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) chamber.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) let call his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) nephew Sir Andred, and bade arm him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) and horse him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) lightly; and by that time it was midnight.
<p/>And so King Mark was armed in black, horse and all; and so at a privy postern they two issued out with their varlets with them, and
<p/>rode till they came to that lake. Then Sir Kay espied them first, and gat his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) spear, and proffered to joust.
<p/>And there at that jousts Sir Kay's horse fell down, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) horse was not so big as the king's horse, and Sir Kay's horse bruised him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) full sore.
<p/>And King Mark rode against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), and smote each other full hard, for the moon shone as the bright day. Then Sir Gaheris was wroth that Sir Kay had a fall.
<p/>Then King Mark was afeard of Sir Gaheris, and so with evil will King Mark rode against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), and Sir Gaheris gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) such a stroke that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) fell down.
<p/>So then forthwithal Sir Gaheris ran unto Sir Andred and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) horse quite, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) helm smote in the earth, and nigh had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) cried: Knight, sit thou fast in thy saddle, for I will revenge my fellow. And therewithal Sir Gaheris alighted, and gat up Sir Kay.
<p/>And then they yode both on foot to them, and bade them yield them, and tell their names outher they should die.
<p/>Then with great pain Sir Andred spake first, and said: It is King Mark of Cornwall, therefore be ye ware what ye do, and I am Sir Andred, his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) cousin.
<p/>Fie on you both, said Sir Gaheris, for a false traitor, and false treason hast thou wrought and he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) both, under the feigned cheer that ye made us!
<p/>it were pity, said Sir Gaheris, that thou shouldst live any longer. Save my life, said King Mark, and I will make amends; and consider that I am a king anointed.
<p/>It were the more shame, said Sir Gaheris, to save thy life; thou art a king anointed with cream, and therefore thou shouldst hold with all men of worship; and therefore thou art worthy to die.
<p/>With that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lashed at King Mark without saying any more, and covered him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) shield and defended him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) might.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) kneeled adown, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) oath upon the cross of the sword, that never while he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lived he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would be against errant-knights.
<p/>And then Sir Kay lashed at Sir Andred, and therewithal King Mark yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) unto Sir Gaheris. And also he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) sware to be good friend unto Sir Tristram if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) came into Cornwall.
<p/>By then Sir Andred was on the earth, and Sir Kay would have slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>). Let be, said Sir Gaheris, slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>)
<p/>It were pity, said Sir Kay, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) should live any longer, for this is nigh cousin unto Sir Tristram, and ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) hath been a traitor unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), and by him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) was exiled out of Cornwall, and therefore I will slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), said Sir Kay.
<p/>not I pray you. Ye shall not, said Sir Gaheris; sithen I have given the king his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life , I pray you give him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life.
<p/>And so Sir Kay and Sir Gaheris rode their way unto Dinas, the Seneschal, for because they heard say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) loved well Sir Tristram.
<p/>And therewithal Sir Kay let him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) go. So they reposed them there, and soon after they rode unto the realm of Logris.
<p/>And so within a little while they met with Sir Launcelot that always had Dame Bragwaine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>), to that intent he (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>) weened to have met the sooner with Sir Tristram; and Sir Launcelot asked what tidings in Cornwall, and whether they heard of Sir Tristram or not.
<p/>Sir Kay and Sir Gaheris answered and said, that they heard not of him (<font color='blue'><b>Kay</b></font>). Then they told Sir Launcelot word by word of their adventure.
<p/>Then Sir Launcelot smiled and said: Hard it is to take out of the flesh that is bred in the bone; and so made them merry together.
<p/>NOW leave we off this tale, and speak we of sir Dinas that had within the castle a paramour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gaheris</b></font>) loved another knight better than him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And so when sir Dinas went out a-hunting she (<font color='blue'><b>Gaheris</b></font>) slipped down by a towel, and took with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gaheris</b></font>) two brachets, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Gaheris</b></font>) yede to the knight that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gaheris</b></font>) loved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Gaheris</b></font>) again.
<p/>And when sir Dinas came home and missed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) paramour and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brachets, then was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) the more wrother for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brachets than for the lady.
<p/>CHAPTER XL How after that Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan had been long in prison they were delivered. So then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rode after the knight that had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) paramour, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) turn and joust.
<p/>And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lady and paramour cried sir Dinas mercy, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would love him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) better than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did.
<p/>Nay, said sir Dinas, I shall never trust them that once betrayed me, and therefore, as ye have begun, so end, for I will never meddle with you.
<p/>So sir Dinas smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) down, that with the fall he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) brake his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leg and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) arm. And so sir Dinas departed, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) brachets with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and so rode to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) castle.
<p/>that was right heavy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) could never hear no tidings of sir Tristram, for all this while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was in prison with sir Darras, Palomides, and Dinadan.
<p/>Then Dame Bragwaine took her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leave to go into Cornwall, and sir Launcelot, sir Kay, and sir Gaheris rode to seek sir Tristram in the country of Surluse.
<p/>Now speaketh this tale of sir Tristram and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) two fellows, for every day sir Palomides brawled and said language against sir Tristram.
<p/>Now will we turn unto sir Launcelot, I marvel, said sir Dinadan, of thee, sir Palomides, an thou haddest sir Tristram here
<p/>thou wouldst do him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) no harm; for an a wolf and a sheep were together in a prison the wolf would suffer the sheep to be in peace.
<p/>And wit thou well, said sir Dinadan, this same is sir Tristram at a word, and now must thou do thy best with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), and let see now if ye can skift it with your hands.
<p/>Sir Palomides, then said sir Tristram, I have heard much of your maugre against me, but I will not meddle with you as at this time by my will, because I dread the lord of this place that hath us in governance
<p/>; for an I dread him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) not more than I do thee, soon it should be skift: so they peaced themself.
<p/>Right so came in a damosel and said: Knights, be of good cheer, for ye are sure of your lives, and that I heard say my lord, Sir Darras.
<p/>Then was sir Palomides abashed and said little. Then were they glad all three, for daily they weened they should have died.
<p/>Then soon after this Sir Tristram fell sick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) weened to have died; then Sir Dinadan wept, and so did Sir Palomides under them both making great sorrow.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) went unto Sir Darras, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) how that mighty knight that bare the black shield was likely to die.
<p/>That shall not be, said Sir Darras, for God defend when knights come to me for succour that I should suffer them to die within my prison.
<p/>So a damosel came in to them and found them mourning. Therefore, said Sir Darras to the damosel, fetch that knight and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fellows afore me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said: Sir knight, me repenteth of thy sickness for thou art called a full noble knight, and so it seemeth by thee; and wit ye
<p/>well it shall never be said that Sir Darras shall destroy such a noble knight as thou art in prison, howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons whereby I was greatly aggrieved.
<p/>thou go and thy fellows, and your harness and horses have been fair and clean kept, and ye shall go where it liketh you, upon this covenant,
<p/>that thou, knight, wilt promise me to be good friend to my sons two that be now alive, and also that thou tell me thy name.
<p/>Sir, said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), as for me my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and in Cornwall was I born, and nephew I am unto King Mark.
<p/>And as for the death of your sons I might not do withal, for an they had been the next kin that I have I might have done none otherwise.
<p/>And then anon Sir Darras saw Sir Tristram brought afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). But now shalt And if I had slain them by treason or treachery I had been worthy to have died.
<p/>All this I consider, said Sir Darras, that all that ye did was by force of knighthood, and that was the cause I would not put you to death.
<p/>But sith ye be Sir Tristram, the good knight, I pray you heartily to be my good friend and to my sons.
<p/>ever while I live I will do you service, for ye have done to us but as a natural knight ought to do.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram reposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) there till that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was amended of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sickness; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was big and strong they took their leave, and every knight took their horses, and so departed and rode together till they came to a cross way.
<p/>Sir, said Sir Tristram, I promise you by the faith of my body, Now fellows, said Sir Tristram, here will we depart in sundry ways.
<p/>How Sir Dinadan rescued a lady from Sir Breuse Saunce Pite, and how Sir Tristram received a shield of Morgan le Fay.
<p/>And because Sir Dinadan had the first adventure of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) I will begin. CHAPTER XLI. SO as Sir Dinadan rode by a well he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) found a lady making great dole.
<p/>Sir knight, said the lady, I am the wofullest lady of the world, for within these five days here came a knight called Sir Breuse Saunce Pite, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slew mine own brother, and ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hath kept me at his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own will, and of all men in the world I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) most; and therefore I require you of knighthood to avenge me, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will not tarry, but be here anon.
<p/>What aileth you? said Sir Dinadan. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) come, said Sir Dinadan, and because of honour of all women I will do my part.
<p/>With this came Sir Breuse, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw a knight with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was wood wroth. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said: Sir knight, keep thee from me.
<p/>So they hurtled together as thunder, and either smote other passing sore, but Sir Dinadan put him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) through the shoulder a grievous wound, and or ever Sir Dinadan might turn him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)
<p/>Then the lady prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to a castle there beside but four mile thence; and so Sir Dinadan brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was welcome, for the lord of that castle was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) uncle; and so Sir Dinadan rode his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) way upon his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) adventure.
<p/>Now turn we this tale unto Sir Tristram, that by adventure he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came to a castle to ask lodging, wherein was Queen Morgan le Fay; and so when Sir Tristram was let into that castle he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had good cheer all that night.
<p/>And upon the morn when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would have departed the queen said: Wit ye well ye shall not depart lightly, for ye are here as a prisoner.
<p/>Sir Breuse was gone and fled. Jesu defend! said Sir Tristram, for I was but late a prisoner. Fair knight, said the queen, ye shall abide with me till
<p/>that I wit what ye are and from whence ye come. And ever the queen would set Sir Tristram on her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) own side, and her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) paramour on the other side.
<p/>And ever Queen Morgan would behold Sir Tristram, and thereat the knight was jealous, and was in will suddenly to have run upon Sir Tristram with a sword, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) left it for shame.
<p/>Then the queen said to Sir Tristram: Tell me thy name, and I shall suffer you to depart when ye will.
<p/>Upon that covenant I tell you my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Ah, said Morgan le Fay, an I had wist that, thou shouldst not have departed so soon as thou shalt.
<p/>But sithen I have made a promise I will hold it, with that thou wilt promise me to bear upon thee a shield that I shall deliver thee, unto the castle of the Hard Rock, where King Arthur had cried a great tournament, and there I pray you that ye will be, and to do for me as much deeds of arms as ye may do.
<p/>For at the Castle of Maidens, Sir Tristram, ye did marvellous deeds of arms as ever I heard knight do. Madam, said Sir Tristram, let me see the shield that I shall bear.
<p/>Then the shield was brought forth, and the field was goldish, with a king and a queen therein painted, and a knight standing above them, -LSB-one foot-RSB- upon the king's head, and the other upon the queen's.
<p/>Madam, said Sir Tristram, this is a fair shield and a mighty; but what signifieth this king and this queen, and the knight standing upon both their heads?
<p/>I shall tell you, said Morgan le Fay, it signifieth King Arthur and Queen Guenever, and a knight who holdeth them both in bondage and in servage.
<p/>But as the French book saith, Queen Morgan loved Sir Launcelot best, and ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) would never love her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) nor do nothing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) request, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) held many knights together for to have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) by strength.
<p/>And because she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) deemed that Sir Launcelot loved Queen Guenever paramour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) again, therefore Queen Morgan le Fay ordained that shield to put Sir Launcelot to a rebuke, to that intent that King Arthur might understand the love between them.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram took that shield and promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Guenever</b></font>) to bear it at the tournament at the Castle of the Hard Rock.
<p/>Who is that knight? said Sir Tristram. That shall ye not wit as at this time, said the queen. But Sir Tristram knew not that that shield was ordained against Sir Launcelot, but afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knew it.
<p/>CHAPTER XLII. How Sir Tristram took with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the shield, and also how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) slew the paramour of Morgan le Fay.
<p/>Then came the knight that held Queen Morgan le Fay, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) name was Sir Hemison, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) ready to follow Sir Tristram.
<p/>SO then Sir Tristram took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leave of the queen, and took the shield with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). Fair friend, said Morgan, ride not after that knight, for ye shall not win no worship of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>).
<p/>Fie on him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>), coward, said Sir Hemison, for I wist never good knight come out of Cornwall but if it were Sir Tristram de Liones.
<p/>What an that be he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>)? said she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>). Nay, nay, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Liones</b></font>) is with La Beale Isoud, and this is but a daffish knight.
<p/>Alas, my fair friend, ye shall find him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the best knight that ever ye met withal, for I know him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) better than ye do.
<p/>Ah, fair friend, said the queen, me repenteth that ye will follow that knight, for I fear me sore of your again coming.
<p/>With this this knight rode his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) way wood wroth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode after Sir Tristram as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had been chased with knights.
<p/>For your sake, said Sir Hemison, I shall slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). When Sir Tristram heard a knight come after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) so fast he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) returned about, and saw a knight coming against him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>Then they rushed together as it had been thunder, and Sir Hemison brised his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spear upon Sir Tristram, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) harness was so good that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might not hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came nigh to Sir Tristram he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) cried on high: Sir knight, keep thee from me. And Sir Tristram smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) harder, and bare him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) through the body, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) horse's croup.
<p/>Then Sir Tristram turned to have done more with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) sword, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw so much blood go from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) seemed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was likely to die, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) departed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and came to a fair manor to an old knight, and there Sir Tristram lodged.
<p/>CHAPTER XLIII. How Morgan le Fay buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) paramour, and how Sir Tristram praised Sir Launcelot and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) kin. NOW leave to speak of Sir Tristram, and speak we of the knight that was wounded to the death.
<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) varlet alighted, and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) helm, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lord whether there were any life in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).
<p/>life said the knight, but it is but little; and therefore leap thou up behind me when thou hast holpen me up, and hold me fast that I fall not, and bring me to Queen Morgan le Fay; for deep draughts of death draw to my heart that I may not live, for I would fain speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) or
<p/>There is in me I died: for else my soul will be in great peril an I die. For-LSB-thwith-RSB- with great pain his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) varlet brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) to the castle, and there Sir Hemison fell down dead.
<p/>When Morgan le Fay saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) dead she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) made great sorrow out of reason; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) let despoil him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) unto his (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) shirt, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>) put into a tomb.
<p/>And about the tomb she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) let write: Here lieth Sir Hemison, slain by the hands of Sir Tristram de Liones. Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that asked the knight his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) host if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw late any knights adventurous.
<p/>Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, the last night here lodged with me Ector de Maris and a damosel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>), and that damosel told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) was one of the best knights of the world.
<p/>That is not so, said Sir Tristram, for I know four better knights of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) own blood, and the first is Sir Launcelot du Lake, call him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the best knight, and Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Sir Gaheris.
<p/>That is not so, said Sir Tristram, for I have met with them both, and I felt Sir Gaheris for the better knight, and Sir Lamorak
<p/>Nay, said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) host, Sir Gawaine is a better knight than he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). I call him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) as good as any of them except Sir Launcelot.
<p/>Why name ye not Sir Tristram? said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) host, for I account him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) as good as any of them. I know not Sir Tristram, said Tristram.
<p/>And on the morn Sir Tristram departed, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) host, and rode toward the Roche Dure, and none adventure had Sir Tristram but that; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rested not till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came to the castle, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) saw five hundred tents.
<p/>Thus they talked and bourded as long as them list, and then went to rest. CHAPTER XLIV. How Sir Tristram at a tournament bare the shield that Morgan le Fay delivered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fay</b></font>).
<p/>THEN the King of Scots and the King of Ireland held against King Arthur's knights, and there began a great medley.
<p/>So came in Sir Tristram and did marvellous deeds of arms, for there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smote down many knights. And ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was afore King Arthur with that shield.
<p/>And when King Arthur saw that shield he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) marvelled greatly in what intent it was made; but Queen Guenever deemed as it was, wherefore
<p/>Then was there a damosel of Queen Morgan in a chamber by King Arthur, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) heard King Arthur speak of that shield, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spake openly unto King Arthur.
<p/>Sir King, wit ye well this shield was ordained for you, to warn you of your shame and dishonour, and that longeth to you and your queen.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was heavy. And then anon that damosel picked her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) away privily, that no man wist where she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was become. Then was King Arthur sad and wroth, and asked from whence came that damosel.
<p/>Then Queen Guenever called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) Sir Ector de Maris, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) complaint to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>), and said: I wot well this shield was made by Morgan le Fay in despite of me and of Sir Launcelot, wherefore I dread me sore lest I should be destroyed.
<p/>And ever the king beheld Sir Tristram, that did so marvellous deeds of arms that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wondered sore what knight he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) might be, and well he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wist it was not Sir Launcelot.
<p/>And it was told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that Sir Tristram was in Petit Britain with Isoud la Blanche Mains, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) deemed, an he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had been in the realm of Logris, Sir Launcelot or some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fellows that were in the quest of Sir Tristram that they should have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) or that time.
<p/>There was not one that knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) nor wist where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was become. So King Arthur had marvel what knight he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might be.
<p/>Then ever Sir Tristram smote down knights wonderly to behold, what upon the right hand and upon the left hand, that unnethe no knight might withstand him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>And ever Sir Arthur's eye was on that shield. All that espied the queen, and that made her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) sore afeard. And the King of Scots and the King of Ireland began to withdraw them.
<p/>When Arthur espied that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thought that that knight with the strange shield should not escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) called unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) Sir Uwaine le Blanche Mains, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arm him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ready.
<p/>So anon King Arthur and Sir Uwaine dressed them before Sir Tristram, and required him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to tell them where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had that shield.
<p/>So here endeth this history of this book, for it is the first book of Sir Tristram de Liones and the second book of Sir Tristram followeth.
