<p/>To be content with what we at present know, is, for the most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire.
<p/>And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu of their conventional value.
<p/>The same principles which have swept away traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society.
<p/>The credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church.
<p/>History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow.
<p/>Mere statements are jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) history, as the facts he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) records.
<p/>Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is sifted.
<p/>FUNERAL OF HECTOR. INTRODUCTION. Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of scepticism. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its demands.
<p/>In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history.
<p/>To form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great whole--we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than the respective probability of its details.
<p/>Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know least, and talk most.
<p/>Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere-LRB-1-RRB- have, perhaps, contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will follow.
<p/>The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty.
<p/>Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Xenophon</b></font>) was one of the dramatis personae in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Xenophon</b></font>) appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the writers who have handed them down.
<p/>When we have read Plato or Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when we have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant.
<p/>It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were too much for our belief.
<p/>This system--which has often comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of Strauss for those of the New Testament--has been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries.
<p/>To question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more excusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus.
<p/>To deny a fact related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized-- Numa Pompilius.
<p/>Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer, and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey.
<p/>What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. '' This cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because it cannot be true.
<p/>'' Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and oblivion.
<p/>It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which truth is the requisite most wanting.
<p/>Before taking a brief review of the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to Herodotus.
<p/>According to this document, the city of Cumae in Ćolia, was, at an early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece.
<p/>Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes. Although poor, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) married, and the result of the union was a girl named Critheis.
<p/>The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we <div class="bookquote">``are indebted for so much happiness.
<p/>Homer was the first fruit of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) juvenile frailty, and received the name of Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Boeotia, whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reputation.
<p/>At this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>this maiden</b></font>)</div>continues our narrative, ``there lived at Smyrna a man named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being married, engaged Critheis to manage his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) household, and spin the flax he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) received as the price of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scholastic labours.
<p/>So satisfactory was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) performance of this task, and so modest her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) conduct, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement, willing to adopt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) son, who, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asserted, would become a clever man, if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) were carefully brought up.
<p/>They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) schoolfellows in every attainment, and, when older, rivalled his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) preceptor in wisdom.
<p/>Melesigenes carried on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) adopted father's school with great success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city.
<p/>Among these visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded Melesigenes to close his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) school, and accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) travels.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) promised not only to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) expenses, but to furnish him (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) with a further stipend, urging, that, ``While he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) was yet young, it was fitting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) should see with his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) discourses.
<p/>Melesigenes consented, and set out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) patron, <div class="bookquote">``examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) met.
<p/>We may also suppose, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) wrote memoirs of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) deemed worthy of preservation-LRB-2-RRB- Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca.
<p/>Here Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) eyes, became much worse, and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) to the medical superintendence of a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), named Mentor, the son of Alcinor.
<p/>Under his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed the subject of the Odyssey.
<p/>The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>patron</b></font>)</div>'' '' Phemius died, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) sole heir to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) property, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) mother soon followed. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) then returned to Smyrna, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) applied himself to the study of poetry.-LRB-3-RRB-
<p/>But poverty soon drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean plain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae.
<p/>And up to my time,'' continued the author, <div class="bookquote">``the inhabitants showed the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) used to sit when giving a recitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) verses, and they greatly honoured the spot.
<p/>Here his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) misfortunes and poetical talent gained him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) the friendship of one Tychias, an armourer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>Here also a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived''.-LRB-4-RRB-
<p/>Here, the Cumans say, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) composed an epitaph on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.-LRB-5-RRB-
<p/>Arrived at Cumae, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) frequented the converzationes -LRB-6-RRB- of the old men, and delighted all by the charms of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) poetry.
<p/>Encouraged by this favourable reception, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) declared that, if they would allow him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) a public maintenance, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) would render their city most gloriously renowned.
<p/>But poverty still drove him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) went by way of Larissa, as being the most convenient road. They avowed their willingness to support him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) in the measure he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) proposed, and procured him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) an audience in the council.
<p/>Having made the speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) proposal.
<p/>The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet's demand, but one man observed that <div class="bookquote">``if they were to feed Homers, they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>''-LRB-7-RRB- With a love of economy, which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) disappointment in a wish that Cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``From this circumstance,''  (<font color='red'><b>the writer</b></font>)</div>says the writer, ``Melesigenes acquired the name of Homer, for the Cumans call blind men Homers. At Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.
<p/>One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept Homer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) own house, and allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) a pittance, on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) name.
<p/>Having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary publishers, neglected the man whose brains he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sucked, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) departure, Homer is said to have observed: <div class="bookquote">``O Thestorides, of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligible than
<p/>the human heart.'' (<font color='red'><b>Homer</b></font>)</div>-LRB-8-RRB- Homer continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) recite, acquainted him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems.
<p/>No vessel happened then to be setting sail thither, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) found one ready to Start for Erythrae, a town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) prevailed upon the seamen to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) to accompany them.
<p/>Having embarked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) invoked a favourable wind, and prayed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) might be able to expose the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) breach of hospitality, had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.
<p/>At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) in Phocoea, by whose assistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) at length, after some difficulty, reached the little hamlet of Pithys.
<p/>This at once determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) to set out for Chios. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) met with an adventure, which we will continue in the words of our author.
<p/>'' Having set out from Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing. The dogs barked on his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) approach, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) cried out.
<p/>Glaucus -LRB-for that was the name of the goat-herd-RRB- heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) voice, ran up quickly, called off his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) dogs, and drove them away from Homer.
<p/>For or some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone, and what could be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) design in coming.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and inquired who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come to desolate places and untrodden spots, and of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood in need.
<p/>Homer, by recounting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) the whole history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) misfortunes, moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) with compassion; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>), and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) cot, and having lit a fire, bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) sup.-LRB-9-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest.
<p/>First give the dogs their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since, whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.
<p/>Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author. Having finished supper, they banqueted-LRB-10 -RRB- afresh on conversation, Homer narrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) wanderings, and telling of the cities he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) had visited.
<p/>At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus resolved to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) master, and acquaint him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) meeting with Homer.
<p/>Having arrived at Bolissus, a place near the farm, and finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) mate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) the whole story respecting Homer and his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) journey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) paid little attention to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) said, and blamed Glaucus for his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons.
<p/>Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) left Homer at home, promising to return quickly. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) bring the stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>).
<p/>Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>), assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) that good fortune would be the result.
<p/>Conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to remain, and to undertake the charge of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) children.-LRB-11-RRB-
<p/>Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of Chios he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) established a school where he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) taught the precepts of poetry.
<p/>To this day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler</b></font>)</div>says Chandler,-LRB-12-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``the most curious remain is that which has been named, without reason, the School of Homer.

<p/>The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already been mentioned:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) has inserted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) poem as the companion of Ulysses,-LRB-13-RRB- in return for the care taken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) when afflicted with blindness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single, the other married a Chian. He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) also testifies his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) gratitude to Phemius, who had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) both sustenance and instruction.
<p/>Having, it is said, made some additions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) poems calculated to please the vanity of the Athenians, of whose city he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) had hitherto made no mention,-LRB-14-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) sent out for Samos.
<p/>Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) in Chios, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) was handsomely received, and invited to join in celebrating the Apaturian festival.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) recited some verses, which gave great satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon festivals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich, with whose children he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) was very popular.
<p/>In the spring he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios, now Ino, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) fell extremely ill, and died.
<p/>It is said that his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) death arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermen's children.-LRB-15-RRB-
<p/>Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail.
<p/>Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a persevering, patient, and learned--but by no means consistent--series of investigations has led.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the poet</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) to visit Greece, whither his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) reputation had now extended. In doing so, I profess to bring forward statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.
<p/>The history of this poet and his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) works is lost in doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who have done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness.
<p/>The majestic stream of his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the Nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.
<p/>Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the Homeric question is involved.
<p/>With no less truth and feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) proceeds:-- <div class="bookquote">``It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Homer appeared. '' If the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light.
<p/>The creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most part, created far out of the reach of observation.
<p/>If we were in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.
<p/>-LRB-16-RRB- From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue.
<p/>Was Homer an individual?-LRB-17-RRB- or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?
<p/>'' Well has Landor remarked: ``Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last.
<p/>We are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us.
<p/>My opinion is, that what is best for us is our admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.
<p/>But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysis--our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) judgment to his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) imagination, and to condescend to dry details.
<p/>Before, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of the Homeric poems, -LRB-at least of the Iliad,-RRB- I must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its original composition.
<p/>It was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole.
<p/>The most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.

<p/>Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit, How parts relate to parts, or they to whole The body's harmony, the beaming soul, Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see, When man's whole frame is obvious to a flea.'''-LRB-19-RRB-
<p/>Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems.
<p/>The grave and cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,-LRB-20-RRB- the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics.
<p/>Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad,-LRB-21-RRB- and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names-LRB-22-RRB- it would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever arose.
<p/>So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.
<p/>At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that <div class="bookquote">``Homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment.
<p/>These loose songs were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about Peisistratus' time, about five hundred years after.'' (<font color='red'><b>Bentley</b></font>)</div>-LRB-23-RRB-
<p/>Two French writers--Hedelin and Perrault--avowed a similar scepticism on the subject; but it is in the <div class="bookquote">``Scienza Nuova''  (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div>of Battista Vico, that we first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf with so much learning and acuteness.
<p/>Indeed, it is with the Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote-LRB-24-RRB---
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf, turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the Homeric text.
<p/>A considerable part of that dissertation -LRB-though by no means the whole-RRB- is employed in vindicating the position, previously announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ.
<p/>As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>), transmitted with assurance to posterity.
<p/>The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf's case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey.
<p/>By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning.
<p/>To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to Peisistratus and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are nowise admissible.
<p/>But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems, in the ninth century before the Christian aera.
<p/>Few things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight, opposed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than Wolf himself.
<p/>We have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, Kallinus, Tyrtaeus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets, committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar.
<p/>The first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenaea: but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are unable to say.
<p/>Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetry--for they admit generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and heard,--but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems--the unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy.
<p/>But here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory,
<p/>-LRB-25-RRB- is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious.
<p/>Moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his (<font color='blue'><b>bard</b></font>) memory by consulting a manuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself.
<p/>The author of that hymn, be he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) who he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) may, could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) art, if he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) chest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Grote/-- Grote</b></font>)</div>The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh century before the Christian aera, are exceedingly trifling. '' ''
<p/>The loss of the digamma, that crux of critics, that quicksand upon which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a considerable change.
<p/>Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies been preserved.
<p/>If Chaucer's poetry, for instance, had not been written, it could only have come down to us in a softened form, more like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble original.
<p/>At what period,'' continues Grote, <div class="bookquote">``these poems, or indeed any other Greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture, though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solon.
<p/>If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any more determinate period, the question a once suggests itself, What were the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer?
<p/>Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce.
<p/>Not for the general public--they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival.
<p/>The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter.
<p/>Incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed.
<p/>If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing.
<p/>Now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the Christian aera -LRB-B.C. 660 to B.C. 630-RRB-, the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, &c.
<p/>I ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music--the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life.
<p/>Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication -LRB-to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet
<p/>It argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer.
<p/>There seems, therefore, ground for conjecturing that -LRB-for the use of this newly-formed and important, but very narrow class-RRB-, manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old epics,--the Thebais and the Cypria, as well as the Iliad and the Odyssey,--began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century -LRB-B.C. 1-RRB-; and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon.
<p/>A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes.'' (<font color='red'><b>Grote/-- Grote</b></font>)</div>-LRB-26-RRB-
<p/>But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following observations-- ''
<p/>There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion, throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid compilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian ruler.
<p/>'' For whom was a written Iliad necessary? the nearest approaching to the sense-RRB-. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of Grecian song, of which, alas!
<p/>we have inherited little more than the fame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is almost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain.
<p/>Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the Homeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristics--still it is difficult to suppose that the language, particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts, should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression.
<p/>It is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott has done in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) continuation of Sir Tristram.
<p/>If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation.
<p/>In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times, the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors.
<p/>But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part.
<p/>It is possible, indeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic fact, that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against the rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadae, the chieftain of Thessaly, from his (<font color='blue'><b>chieftain</b></font>) valour and the number of his (<font color='blue'><b>chieftain</b></font>) forces, may have been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste.
<p/>The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian synod of compilers of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid.
<p/>'' Even the few passages which relate to their ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. Could France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the hero of the Jerusalem.
<p/>If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle, as to admit no rivalry,--it is still surprising, that throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship of an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a race, who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring neighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestors--or, at least, to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) age.''-LRB-27-RRB-
<p/>While it is to be confessed, that Wolf's objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather augmented than otherwise, if we admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) hypothesis.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) divides the first twenty-two books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus.
<p/>To return to the Wolfian theory. Nor is Lachmann's-LRB-28-RRB- modification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) theory any better. This, as Grote observes, ``explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else.
<p/>Moreover, we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the secession of Achilles:
<p/>Elphenor, chief of the Euboeans; Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians.
<p/>None of these heroes again make their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that ``it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.
<p/>The discrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in the fifth book, weeps at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) son's funeral in the thirteenth, can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation.
<p/>Grote, although not very distinct in stating his (<font color='blue'><b>Grote</b></font>) own opinions on the subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian theory, and of Lachmann's modifications with the character of Peisistratus.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has also shown, and we think with equal success, that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems, or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by Peisistratus, and not before his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) time, are essentially distinct.
<p/>In short, ``a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the period of its first compilation.
<p/>The friends or literary employes of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient, and the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic <div class="bookquote">``recension,''  (<font color='red'><b>the critics</b></font>)</div>goes far to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts they examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of attention.
<p/>There is nothing, either in the Iliad or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age of Peisistratus--nothing which brings to our view the alterations brought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican governments, the close military array, the improved construction of ships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c., familiar to the latter epoch.
<p/>These alterations Onomakritus, and the other literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to notice, even without design, had they then, for the first time, undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one large aggregate.
<p/>Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in substance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus.
<p/>Indeed, even the interpolations -LRB-or those passages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such-RRB- betray no trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus--in some cases even by Arktinus and Hesiod--as genuine Homeric matter-LRB-29-RRB-
<p/>As far as the evidences on the case, as well internal as external, enable us to judge, we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand -LRB-always allowing for paitial divergences of text and interpolations-RRB- in 776 B.C., our first trustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient date, let it be added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most important attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in reference to Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into the anti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later condition.''-LRB-30-RRB-
<p/>On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must confess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) labours.
<p/>At the same time, so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that Athenian-LRB-31-RRB- would lead him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and re-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis.
<p/>I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author.
<p/>'' '' '' '' Moreover,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) continues, ``the whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is here remarked. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we are upon either subject.
<p/>I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the Spartan Confucius.
<p/>I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt, made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like consistency.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to `discourse in excellent music' among them.
<p/>Many of these, like those of the negroes in the United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing around them.
<p/>The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times.
<p/>It is as follows:-- But what was passing around them? Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation.
<p/>Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>a poet</b></font>)</div><p/>It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) published these lays, connecting them by a tale of his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) own.
<p/>The author, however, did not affix his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collector</b></font>) modesty and talent, than of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collector</b></font>) mere drudging arrangement of other people's ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, 'a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.'
<p/>This poem now exists, under the title of the `Odyssea.' '' While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Odysseus</b></font>) met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon.
<p/>Unity of design, however, caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) former work: and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the Cid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad.
<p/>Melesigenes knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but, first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets, assemblies, and agoras.
<p/>However, Solon first, and then Peisistratus, and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great measure.''-LRB-33-RRB-
<p/>Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems.
<p/>To deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or enjoy these poems.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>copyist</b></font>) noble mind seized the hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleis-LRB-32-RRB- grew under his (<font color='blue'><b>copyist</b></font>) hand. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one author, be he (<font color='blue'><b>copyist</b></font>) Homer or Melesigenes, quocunque
<p/>, I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.
<p/>nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise. Indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an attempt would be gross inconsistency.
<p/>But, while I appreciate its importance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on its aesthetic value, especially in poetry.
<p/>Three parts of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had they been suggested to the author by his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) Maecenas or Africanus, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) would probably have adopted.
<p/>Moreover, those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often least competent to carry out their own precepts.
<p/>I do not at this moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute points, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune.
<p/>Grammarians are not poets by profession, but may be so per accidens. But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity.
<p/>Binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything
<p/>but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book after book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a collection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand.
<p/>If we compare the theories of Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of Homer.
<p/>One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) theory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else.
<p/>Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill, seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies attributed to Seneca are by four different authors.-LRB-34-RRB-
<p/>Now, I will venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in their borrowed phraseology--a phraseology with which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves--in their freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman, be he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more equally bad.
<p/>With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the Ćneid of Virgil, and the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions.
<p/>Now, without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning--nay, the refined acuteness--which scholars, like Wolf, have bestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity.
<p/>Nor can I help thinking, that the literary history of more recent times will account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation.
<p/>I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others.
<p/>But, after all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals, and which are its most fitting judges.
<p/>The ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios.
<p/>To believe the author of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus.
<p/>Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary novelty. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the very name of Homer.
<p/>Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.
<p/>While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature herself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in believing in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,--still
<p/>I am far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) might derive both subject and embellishment.
<p/>But it is one thing to use existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to patch up the poem itself from such materials.
<p/>What consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?
<p/>A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality.
<p/>In fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions--nay, even his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination.
<p/>But unless there be some grand pervading principle--some invisible, yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never come to the birth.
<p/>, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will require little acuteness to detect.
<p/>Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief, it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained.
<p/>We are not by nature intended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal.
<p/>Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most pathetic Were faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our ignorance on any matter.
<p/>But we are too well taught the contrary lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity.
<p/>And there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter.
<p/>Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover.
<p/>In reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the same sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector.
<p/>And if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm -LRB-and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of Homer-RRB-, we shall feel that the poems of Homer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.
<p/>And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old.
<p/>Heeren, who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely observes:-- <div class="bookquote">``It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation.
<p/>Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks.
<p/>No poet has ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) countrymen. This is a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy.
<p/>When lawgivers and sages appeared in Greece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they paid homage to his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) superior genius.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) held up before his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) nation the mirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity and truth.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature; on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which outweighs all others, the love of glory.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which cherishes the same sympathies.
<p/>If it is granted to his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) immortal spirit, from another heaven than any of which he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) dreamed on earth, to look down on his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) race, to see the nations from the fields of Asia to the forests of Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) magic wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) to view the vast assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had been called into being by means of his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) songs; wherever his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) immortal spirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) happiness.'' (<font color='red'><b>Heeren</b></font>)</div>-LRB-35-RRB-
<p/>Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the <div class="bookquote">``Apotheosis of Homer'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-36-RRB- is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing association, how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds, is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition?
<p/>The more we read, and the more we think--think as becomes the readers of Homer,--the more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry gave us this rich inheritance, whole and entire.
<p/>Whatever were the means of its preservation, let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories, whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other.
<p/>As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not included in Pope's translation, I will content myself with a brief account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice-LRB-37-RRB-:-- <div class="bookquote">``This poem,''  (<font color='red'><b>a writer</b></font>)</div>says Coleridge, ``is a short mock-heroic of ancient date.
<p/>The text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of Homer's genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees, mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was uncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies, know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings.
<p/>As to this little poem being a youthful prolusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody, not only of the general spirit, but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and even, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the objection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse that order in the development of national taste, which the history of every other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost ascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the Homeric age.
<p/>Knight infers from the usage of the word deltos, <div class="bookquote">``writing tablet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knight/Knight</b></font>)</div>instead of diphthera, <div class="bookquote">``skin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knight/Knight</b></font>)</div>which, according to Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity; and generally that the familiar mention of the cock -LRB-v. 191-RRB- is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition.
<p/>Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope's design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) translation, and on my own purpose in the present edition.
<p/>'' Pope was not a Grecian. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) whole education had been irregular, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby.
<p/>It is not too much to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language.
<p/>There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes, which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical attainments were sounder than his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) own, during the undertaking; but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original.
<p/>Hence his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation. And in those days, what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present.
<p/>If something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poet's meaning, his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) words were less jealously sought for, and those who could read so good a poem as Pope's Iliad had fair reason to be satisfied.
<p/>We must be content to look at it as a most delightful work in itself,--a work which is as much a part of English literature as Homer himself is of Greek.
<p/>We must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to amphikupellon being an adjective, and not a substantive.
<p/>Far be it from us to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman's fine, bold, rough old English;--far be it from, us to hold up his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) translation as what a translation of Homer might be.
<p/>But we can still dismiss Pope's Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow.
<p/>As to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up without pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general reader.
<p/>Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer for another publisher, I might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the text.
<p/>But Pope's version was no field for such a display; and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions, to notice occasionally some departures from the original, and to give a few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton.
<p/>In the latter task I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my other annotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views, will be found to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected to admit.
<p/>To write a commentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I have made Pope's translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily accomplished.
<p/>It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope's translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text. THEODORE ALOIS BUCKLEY.
<p/>POPE'S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever.
<p/>The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with him (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>), and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) invention remains yet unrivalled.
<p/>Nor is it a wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry.
<p/>It is the invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses: the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which masters everything besides, can never attain to this.
<p/>It furnishes art with all her (<font color='blue'><b>masters</b></font>) materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but <div class="bookquote">``steal wisely:''  (<font color='red'><b>a steward</b></font>)</div>for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature.
<p/>Whatever praises may be given to works of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure, which the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more entertained with.
<p/>And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.
<p/>Our author's work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater.
<p/>It is like a copious nursery, which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of which those who followed him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) have but selected some particular plants, each according to his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) fancy, to cultivate and beautify.
<p/>If some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.
<p/>It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) reads him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>).
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in action.
<p/>If a council be called, or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poet's imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in another to a spectator.
<p/>The course of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) verses resembles that of the army he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) describes, Hoid' ar' isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito.
<p/>It is, however, remarkable, that his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) fancy, which is everywhere vigorous, is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) poem in its fullest splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and others, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity.
<p/>Exact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this <div class="bookquote">``vivida vis animi,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in a very few.
<p/>Even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove.
<p/>Nay, where this appears, though attended with absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing but its own splendour.
<p/>This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but everywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted flashes:
<p/>In Milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from heaven: but in Homer, and in him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) only, it burns everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly.
<p/>I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) from all other authors.
<p/>This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex.
<p/>It seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of nature, to supply his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) maxims and reflections; all the inward passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) characters: and all the outward forms and images of things for his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) descriptions: but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) opened a new and boundless walk for his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) imagination, and created a world for himself in the invention of fable.
<p/>That which Aristotle calls <div class="bookquote">``the soul of poetry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aristotle</b></font>)</div>was first breathed into it by Homer, I shall begin with considering him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for fiction.
<p/>Christ Church. '' They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it. '' Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the marvellous.
<p/>The probable fable is the recital of such actions as, though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature; or of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them.
<p/>Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem, <div class="bookquote">``The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in Italy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or the like.
<p/>That of the Iliad is the <div class="bookquote">``anger of Achilles,''  (<font color='red'><b>any poet</b></font>)</div>the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet.
<p/>Yet this he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity.
<p/>The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days.
<p/>Virgil, for want of so warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer's poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>).
<p/>The other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time.
<p/>Nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) invention, but they have followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) in every episode and part of story.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius -LRB-rather than omit them-RRB- destroys the unity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) actions for those of Archemorus.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up their forces in the same order. If Ulysses visit the shades, the Ćneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>).
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) be detained from his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) return by the allurements of Calypso, so is Ćneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida.
<p/>If Achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem, Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account.
<p/>Virgil has not only observed this close imitation of Homer, but, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) had not led the way, supplied the want from other Greek authors.
<p/>Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking of Troy, was copied -LRB-says Macrobius-RRB- almost word for word from Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Ćneas are taken from those of Medea and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.
<p/>To proceed to the allegorical fable--If we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) allegories, what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us!
<p/>How fertile will that imagination appear, which as able to clothe all the properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed!
<p/>This is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) circle, but for their judgment in having contracted it.
<p/>For when the mode of learning changed in the following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it.
<p/>And perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) time that demand upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs. The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially the machines of the gods.
<p/>If Homer was not the first who introduced the deities -LRB-as Herodotus imagines-RRB- into the religion of Greece, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods, constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support of it.
<p/>But whatever cause there might be to blame his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) machines in a philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic, that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) has set: every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the various changes of times and religions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) gods continue to this day the gods of poetry.
<p/>We come now to the characters of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) persons; and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them.
<p/>Every one has something so singularly his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) own, that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by their manners.
<p/>Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the Iliad.
<p/>That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and generous one.
<p/>Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) takes care to give a tincture of that principal one.
<p/>For example: the main characters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this, that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural, open, and regular.
<p/>But they have, besides, characters of courage; and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other upon experience.
<p/>The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and, where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) characters of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest,
<p/>In like manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savage courage appears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, &c.
<p/>It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family.
<p/>I believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection, if he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point, the invention of Homer was to that of all others.
<p/>The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters; being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners, of those who utter them.
<p/>As there is more variety of characters in the Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. ''
<p/>Everything in it has manner'' -LRB-as Aristotle expresses it-RRB-, that is, everything is acted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how small a number of lines are employed in narration.
<p/>In Virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally just in any person's mouth upon the same occasion.
<p/>As many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) persons have no apparent characters, so many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety.
<p/>We oftener think of the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in Homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests us less in the action described.
<p/>If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers. Longinus has given his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) opinion, that it was in this part Homer principally excelled.
<p/>What were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) sentiments in general, is, that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture.
<p/>And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) has not so many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) is not fired by the Iliad.
<p/>Duport, in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort. If we observe his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the invention still predominant.
<p/>To what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance of art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and fecundity of his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) imagination to which all things, in their various views presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat?
<p/>Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) not only gives us the full prospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side views, unobserved by any painter but Homer.
<p/>Nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) battles, which take up no less than half the Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness, horror, and confusion.
<p/>It is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>); and it is evident of Virgil especially, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) master.
<p/>If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) expression is like the colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity.
<p/>We acknowledge him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) the father of poetical diction; the first who taught that <div class="bookquote">``language of the gods''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>to men. It is, indeed, the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit.
<p/>Aristotle had reason to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) was the only poet who had found out <div class="bookquote">``living words;''  (<font color='red'><b>the poet</b></font>)</div>there are in him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever.
<p/>An arrow is <div class="bookquote">``impatient''  (<font color='red'><b>an enemy</b></font>)</div>to be on the wing, a weapon <div class="bookquote">``thirsts''  (<font color='red'><b>an enemy</b></font>)</div>to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in proportion to it.
<p/>It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the same degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter, as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more intense.
<p/>This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images.
<p/>On this last consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) invention, since -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has managed them-RRB-
<p/>To throw his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected the compound epithets. they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were joined.
<p/>We see the motion of Hector's plumes in the epithet Korythaiolos, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Einosiphyllos, and so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description -LRB-though but of a single line-RRB- without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure.
<p/>Lastly, if we consider his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) versification, we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) invention in that also.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was not satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) language as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) found it settled in any one part of Greece, but searched through its different dialects with this particular view, to beautify and perfect his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) numbers he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) most affected was the Ionic, which has a peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.
<p/>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the feebler Ćolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry.
<p/>Thus his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) measures, instead of being fetters to his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) rapture, and even to give a further representation of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) notions, in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified.
<p/>Out of all these he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) has derived that harmony which makes us confess he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had not only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world.
<p/>This is so great a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) verses, even without understanding them -LRB-with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas-RRB-, will find more sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of poetry.
<p/>The beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.
<p/>Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) line to a beautiful agreement with its sense.
<p/>If the Grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than the other.
<p/>Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author's beauties in this kind, in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) treatise of the Composition of Words.
<p/>It suffices at present to observe of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make one imagine
<p/>Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time, with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet.
<p/>They roll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.
<p/>As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these epithets is a short description. Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us is his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) invention.
<p/>It is that which forms the character of each part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) work; and accordingly we find it to have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) fable more extensive and copious than any other, his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) manners more lively and strongly marked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) speeches more affecting and transported, his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) sentiments more warm and sublime, his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) images and descriptions more full and animated, his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) expression more raised and daring, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) numbers more rapid and various.
<p/>I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) character.
<p/>Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in them, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole.
<p/>We ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and in proportion to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) degree in that we are to admire him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
<p/>No author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment.
<p/>Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in comparison with one another.
<p/>Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.
<p/>; Virgil leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the Nile, pours out his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) riches with a boundless overflow;
<p/>Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity Virgil, like a river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream.
<p/>Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all before him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>), and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil, calmly daring, like Ćneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the action; disposes all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>), and conquers with tranquillity.
<p/>And when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) own Jupiter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens:
<p/>Virgil, like the same power in his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) whole creation.
<p/>But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins.
<p/>As prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness.
<p/>If we look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections against him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty.
<p/>Among these we may reckon some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) marvellous fictions, upon which so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of probability.
<p/>Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit something near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances.
<p/>Thus Homer has his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``speaking horses;''  (<font color='red'><b>Homer</b></font>)</div>and Virgil his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``myrtles distilling blood;''  (<font color='red'><b>Virgil</b></font>)</div>where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.
<p/>When we behold their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate. It is owing to the same vast invention, that his (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>) similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances.
<p/>The force of this faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which, however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>) similes are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects.
<p/>The same will account for his (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>) manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when his (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>) fancy suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>) at once so many various and correspondent images.
<p/>If there are others which seem rather to charge him (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>) with a defect or narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) lived in.
<p/>Such are his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) grosser representations of the gods; and the vicious and imperfect manners of his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) heroes; but I must here speak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer.
<p/>It must be a strange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,-LRB-38-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``that those times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours.
<p/>Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines?
<p/>On the other side, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of Homer engaged.
<p/>There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs without their guards; princes tending their flocks, and princesses drawing water from the springs.
<p/>When we read Homer, we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and those who consider him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) in this light, will double their pleasure in the perusal of him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>).
<p/>Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found, the only true mirror of that ancient world.
<p/>The reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>By this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their dislike, will become a satisfaction.
<p/>This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) gods and heroes; such as the <div class="bookquote">``far-darting Phoebus,''  (<font color='red'><b>heroes</b></font>)</div>the <div class="bookquote">``blue-eyed Pallas,''  (<font color='red'><b>heroes</b></font>)</div>the <div class="bookquote">``swift-footed Achilles,''  (<font color='red'><b>heroes</b></font>)</div>&c., which some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated.
<p/>Those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit.
<p/>Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature of surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction of each person; either naming his (<font color='blue'><b>Greeks</b></font>) parents expressly, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Greeks</b></font>) place of birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &
<p/>As for the epithets of great men, Mons. c. Homer, therefore, complying with the custom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) country, used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry.
<p/>And, indeed, we have something parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince, &c.
<p/>If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition, I shall add a further conjecture.
<p/>Hesiod, dividing the world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the brazen and the iron one, of <div class="bookquote">``heroes distinct from other men; a divine race who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.
<p/>Now among the divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their families, actions or qualities.
<p/>What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work.
<p/>Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these critics never so much as heard of Homer's having written first; a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) eye.
<p/>Some accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and moral of the Ćneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the Ćneis; as that the hero is a wiser man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) country than that of the other; or else they blame him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) for not doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) never designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Ćneas, when the very moral of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) poem required a contrary character: it is thus that Rapin judges in his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) comparison of Homer and Virgil.
<p/>Others select those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger in his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) Poetics.
<p/>Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of Perrault in his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) Parallels.
<p/>Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to a fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer, and that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) work; but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) times, and the prejudice of those that followed: and in pursuance of this principle, they make those accidents -LRB-such as the contention of the cities, &c.-RRB-
<p/>The same might as well be said of Virgil, or any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>ages</b></font>)</div>to be the causes of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) fame, which were in reality the consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) merit. This is the method of Mons.
<p/>who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) must have been the greatest poet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) nation, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) may be said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>).-LRB-39-RRB-
<p/>In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) title to the honour of the chief invention: and as long as this -LRB-which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself-RRB- remains unequalled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) followers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) still continues superior to them.
<p/>A cooler judgment may commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment.
<p/>Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) has failed in some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) flights, it was but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) attempted everything.
<p/>A work of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.
<p/>Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief characteristic.
<p/>As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem, such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions.
<p/>As it also breaks out in every particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too much softens those, takes off from this chief character.
<p/>It is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) author entire and unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) proper province, since these must be his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) own, but the others he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) is to take as he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) finds them.
<p/>It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the Greek.
<p/>It is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language: but it is a great mistake to imagine -LRB-as many have done-RRB- that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern manners of expression.
<p/>If there be sometimes a darkness, there is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal.
<p/>I know no liberties one ought to take, but those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original, and supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author.
<p/>It is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) managing: however, it is his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) safest way to be content with preserving this to his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than he (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) finds his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) author is, in any particular place.
<p/>It is a great secret in writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) footsteps.
<p/>Where his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterred from imitating him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere English critic.
<p/>Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) style: some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity.
<p/>I see these different followers of Homer, some sweating and straining after him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) by violent leaps and bounds -LRB-the certain signs of false mettle-RRB-, others slowly and servilely creeping in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them.
<p/>However, of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be envied for such commendations, as he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) may gain by that character of style, which his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) friends must agree together to call simplicity, and the rest of the world will call dulness.
<p/>There is a graceful and dignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all.
<p/>de la Mott; What he (<font color='blue'><b>Mott</b></font>) has done admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation. Methinks Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.
<p/>This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the inspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words
<p/>but what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that part of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer.
<p/>This consideration -LRB-together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) thoughts-RRB- may, methinks, induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament; as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.
<p/>For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet.
<p/>They have something venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious -LRB-that is, a more modern-RRB- turn in the paraphrase.
<p/>Perhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner of Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other seems to require a venerable, antique cast.
<p/>But certainly the use of modern terms of war and government, such as <div class="bookquote">``platoon, campaign, junto,''  (<font color='red'><b>translators</b></font>)</div>or the like, -LRB-into which some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) translators have fallen-RRB- cannot be allowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language.
<p/>There are two peculiarities in Homer's diction, which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) at first sight; those who are not his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) greatest admirers look upon them as defects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties.
<p/>I speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) compound epithets, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) repetitions. Many of the former cannot be done literally into English without destroying the purity of our language.
<p/>I believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are become familiar through their use of them; such as <div class="bookquote">``the cloud-compelling Jove,''  (<font color='red'><b>poets</b></font>)</div>&c.
<p/>As for the rest, whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one, the course to be taken is obvious.
<p/>Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous translated literally <div class="bookquote">``leaf-shaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Others</b></font>)</div>but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis: ``the lofty mountain shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) waving woods.
<p/>Others that admit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are introduced.
<p/>For example, the epithet of Apollo, hekaebolos or <div class="bookquote">``far-shooting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Apollo hekaebolos</b></font>)</div>is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect of the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical, with regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where Apollo is represented as a god in person, I would use the former interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would make choice of the latter.
<p/>Upon the whole, it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated -LRB-as has been already shown-RRB- to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once show his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) fancy and his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) judgment.
<p/>As for Homer's repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or hemistitch.
<p/>I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor to offend the reader too much on the other.
<p/>The repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) words; as in the messages from gods to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, or the like.
<p/>In other cases, I believe the best rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is to answer for it.
<p/>'' It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer -LRB-as has been said-RRB- is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every new subject.
<p/>This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it in the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin.
<p/>I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others.
<p/>Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.
<p/>I attempt him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) than any entire translation in verse has yet done.
<p/>Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to Homer. We have only those of Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby.
<p/>Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) has frequent interpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one might think he (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) deviated on purpose, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) did not in other places of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) notes insist so much upon verbal trifles.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) author; insomuch as to promise, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries he (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) expression is involved in fustian; a fault for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) was remarkable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) original writings, as in the tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, &c.
<p/>In a word, the nature of the man may account for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole performance; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appears, from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preface and remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen weeks, shows with what negligence his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) version was performed.
<p/>But that which is to be allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>), and which very much contributed to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) translation, which is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ before he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) arrived at years of discretion.
<p/>Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but for particulars and circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) continually lops them, and often omits the most beautiful.
<p/>As for its being esteemed a close translation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it, which proceeds not from his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) following the original line by line, but from the contractions above mentioned.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) sometimes omits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no writer of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) learning could have fallen, but through carelessness.
<p/>312, where he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) has spun twenty verses out of two. His (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) poetry, as well as Ogilby's, is too mean for criticism.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) has left us only the first book, and a small part of the sixth; in which if he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) has in some places not truly interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be excused on account of the haste he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was obliged to write in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) seems to have had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) in passages where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) wanders from the original.
<p/>However, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) translated the whole work, I would no more have attempted Homer after him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) than Virgil: his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) version of whom -LRB-notwithstanding some human errors-RRB- is the most noble and spirited translation I know in any language.
<p/>But the fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it.
<p/>That which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) chief character: in particular places, where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most agreeing with that character; to copy him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in all the variations of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) style, and the different modulations of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) numbers; to preserve, in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry.
<p/>What I would further recommend to him (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) is, to study his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) author rather from his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to consider him (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns.
<p/>Next these, the Archbishop of Cambray's Telemachus may give him (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author; and Bossu's admirable Treatise of the Epic Poem the justest notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) design and conduct.
<p/>But after all, with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may perform such a work, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must hope to please but a few;
<p/>It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live to translate the Iliad. those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning.
<p/>For to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.
<p/>What I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am prepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets, who are most sensible of the weight of this task.
<p/>As for the worst, whatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers.
<p/>I was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit.
<p/>Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity.
<p/>I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) always serves his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) friend.
<p/>I must also acknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well as sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer.
<p/>I must add the names of Mr. Rowe, and Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last, whose good nature -LRB-to give it a great panegyric-RRB-, is no less extensive than his (<font color='blue'><b>Parnell</b></font>) learning.
<p/>The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. The favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection.
<p/>But what can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me; while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers?
<p/>Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find, that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet: that his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeased I should undertake the author to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) has given -LRB-in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) excellent Essay-RRB-, so complete a praise: ``Read Homer once, and you can read no more; For all books else appear so mean, so poor, Verse will seem prose: but still persist to read, And Homer will be all the books you need.
<p/>That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) generosity or his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) example: that such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great scenes of business, than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not refused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their writer: and that the noble author of the tragedy of <div class="bookquote">``Heroic Love''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>has continued his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) partiality to me, from my writing pastorals to my attempting the Iliad.
<p/>I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing, that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general, but their correction of several particulars of this translation.
<p/>I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the Earl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them.
<p/>Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my desire of having it known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was pleased to promote this affair.
<p/>The particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt -LRB-the son of the late Lord Chancellor-RRB- gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) friendship.
<p/>I must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that has been shown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford.
<p/>And I can hardly envy him (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) those pompous honours he (<font color='blue'><b>Chancellor</b></font>) received after death, when I reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy friendships, which make the satisfaction of life.
<p/>This distinction is the more to be acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of particular men.
<p/>Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of an undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies, after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.
<p/>'' In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. THE ILIAD. BOOK I. ARGUMENT.-LRB-40-RRB- THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.
<p/>In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and Briseis, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles.
<p/>Chryses, the father of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to ransom her (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>); with which the action of the poem opens, in the tenth year of the siege.
<p/>The priest being refused, and insolently dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) god; who inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks.
<p/>Achilles calls a council, and encourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseis.
<p/>The king, being obliged to send back his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) captive, enters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies; however, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) had the absolute command of the army, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) seizes on Briseis in revenge.
<p/>Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) son, by giving victory to the Trojans.
<p/>Jupiter, granting her (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) suit, incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan.
<p/>The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve for Jupiter's stay with the Ćthiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers her (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) petition.
<p/>The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus. Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!
<p/>That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain; Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore, Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.-LRB-41-RRB-
<p/>Since great Achilles and Atrides strove, Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!-LRB-42-RRB- Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour-LRB-43-RRB-
<p/>Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power Latona's son a dire contagion spread,-LRB-44-RRB- And heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead; The king of men his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) reverent priest defied,-LRB-45-RRB-
<p/>And for the king's offence the people died. For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) captive daughter from the victor's chain.
<p/>Suppliant the venerable father stands; Apollo's awful ensigns grace his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hands By these he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) begs; and lowly bending down, Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sued to all, but chief implored for grace The brother-kings, of Atreus' royal race-LRB-46-RRB- '' Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be
<p/>crown'd, And Troy's proud walls lie level with the ground. May Jove restore you when your toils are o'er Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
<p/>But, oh! relieve a wretched parent's pain, And give Chryseis to these arms again; If mercy fail, yet let my presents move, And dread avenging Phoebus, son of Jove.
<p/>Not so Atrides; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), with kingly pride, Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied: <div class="bookquote">``Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains, Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the sire</b></font>)</div>The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare, The priest to reverence, and release the fair. Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod, Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.
<p/>Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain; And prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain; Till time shall rifle every youthful grace, And age dismiss her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) from my cold embrace,
<p/>In daily labours of the loom employ'd, Or doom'd to deck the bed she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) once enjoy'd Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,

<p/>'' O sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear; Refuse, or grant; for what has Jove to fear? Or oh! declare, of all the powers above

<p/>Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful vision to Agamemnon, persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) to lead the army to battle, in order to make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles.
<p/>The general, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) assistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) absence, and the late plague, as well as by the length of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) first communicates his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) design to the princes in council, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run to prepare the ships.
<p/>The assembly is recalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed, which was to make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them into their several nations, before they proceeded to battle.
<p/>This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and Trojans, and in a large catalogue.
<p/>They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day.
<p/>The scene lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end it removes to Troy. Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,
<p/>Stretch'd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie : The immortals slumber'd on their thrones above; All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.-LRB-76-RRB-
<p/>To honour Thetis' son he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bends his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) care, And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war: Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight, And thus commands the vision of the night.

<p/>First on his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) limbs a slender vest he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) drew, Around him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) next the regal mantle threw, The embroider'd sandals on his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) feet were tied;

<p/>The king despatch'd his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heralds with commands To range the camp and summon all the bands: The gathering hosts the monarch's word obey
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) black ship the Pylian prince he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) found; There calls a senate of the peers around: The assembly placed, the king of men express'd

<p/>Late as I slumber'd in the shades of night, A dream divine appear'd before my sight; Whose visionary form like Nestor came, The same in habit, and in mien the same.-LRB-80-RRB-
<p/>Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides, Directs in council, and in war presides; To whom its safety a whole people owes, To waste long nights in indolent repose.

<p/>Now, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms, Unite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms. But first, with caution, try what yet they dare, Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.
<p/>To move the troops to measure back the main, Be mine; and yours the province to detain. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said, -LRB-Nestor, whom Pylos' sandy realms obey'd,-RRB-

<p/>As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees, Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms, With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms; Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd, And o'er the vale descends the living cloud.-LRB-81-RRB-
<p/>So, from the tents and ships, a lengthen'd train Spreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain: Along the region runs a deafening sound; Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.
<p/>Fame flies before the messenger of Jove, And shining soars, and claps her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wings above. Nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud-LRB-82-RRB-
<p/>The monarch's will, suspend the listening crowd. Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear, And fainter murmurs died upon the ear,
<p/>The king of kings his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) awful figure raised: High in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hand the golden sceptre blazed; The golden sceptre, of celestial flame, By Vulcan form'd, from Jove to Hermes came.
<p/>To Pelops he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the immortal gift resign'd; The immortal gift great Pelops left behind, In Atreus' hand, which not with Atreus ends, To rich Thyestes next the prize descends; And now the mark of Agamemnon's reign, Subjects all Argos, and controls the main.-LRB-83-RRB-
<p/>On this bright sceptre now the king reclined, And artful thus pronounced the speech design'd: <div class="bookquote">``Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader's care, Heroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!
<p/>Of partial Jove with justice I complain, And heavenly oracles believed in vain A safe return was promised to our toils, Renown'd, triumphant, and enrich'd with spoils.
<p/>Now shameful flight alone can save the host, Our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost. So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!
<p/>At whose command whole empires rise or fall: He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shakes the feeble props of human trust, And towns and armies humbles to the dust
<p/>What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage, Oh, lasting shame in every future age! Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow, Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.
<p/>So small their number, that if wars were ceased, And Greece triumphant held a general feast, All rank'd by tens, whole decades when they dine
<p/>Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.-LRB-84-RRB- But other forces have our hopes o'erthrown, And Troy prevails by armies not her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) own.

<p/>Our weeping wives, our tender children call: Love, duty, safety, summon us away, 'Tis nature's voice, and nature we obey, Our shatter'd barks may yet transport us o'er, Safe and inglorious, to our native shore.
<p/>Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run, Haste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall! Fly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ, And dream no more of heaven-defended Troy.
<p/>So roll the billows to the Icarian shore, From east and south when winds begin to roar, Burst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep The whitening surface of the ruffled deep.
<p/>And as on corn when western gusts descend,-LRB-85-RRB- Before the blast the lofty harvests bend: Thus o'er the field the moving host appears, With nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.
<p/>The gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet Beat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet; With long-resounding cries they urge the train To fit the ships, and launch into the main.

<p/>The doubling clamours echo to the skies. E'en then the Greeks had left the hostile plain, And fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain;
<p/>But Jove's imperial queen their flight survey'd, And sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid: <div class="bookquote">``Shall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace!

<p/>The blue-eyed Pallas, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) celestial friend, -LRB-In form a herald,-RRB- bade the crowds attend. The expecting crowds in still attention hung, To hear the wisdom of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) heavenly tongue.
<p/>Then deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) spoke, His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) silence thus the prudent hero broke: <div class="bookquote">``Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race With shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.
<p/>Once all their voice, but ah! forgotten now: Ne'er to return, was then the common cry, Till Troy's proud structures should in ashes lie.
<p/>Not such at Argos was their generous vow: Behold them weeping for their native shore; What could their wives or helpless children more?
<p/>Few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat, When the ship tosses, and the tempests beat: Then well may this long stay provoke their tears, The tedious length of nine revolving years.
<p/>What heart but melts to leave the tender train, And, one short month, endure the wintry main? Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame; But vanquish'd!
<p/>baffled! oh, eternal shame! Expect the time to Troy's destruction given. And try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven. What pass'd at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,-LRB-89-RRB-

<p/>For while around we gazed with wondering eyes, And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice, Full of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) god, the reverend Chalcas cried,-LRB-90-RRB- '
<p/>As many birds as by the snake were slain, So many years the toils of Greece remain; But wait the tenth, for Ilion's fall decreed:' Thus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.
<p/>Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside. This wondrous signal Jove himself displays, Of long, long labours, but eternal praise. Obey, ye Grecians!

<p/>Your leagues concluded, your engagements past? Vow'd with libations and with victims then, Now vanish'd like their smoke: the faith of men!
<p/>While useless words consume the unactive hours, No wonder Troy so long resists our powers. Rise, great Atrides! and with courage sway; We march to war, if thou direct the way.
<p/>But leave the few that dare resist thy laws, The mean deserters of the Grecian cause, To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares, And view with envy our successful wars.
<p/>On that great day, when first the martial train, Big with the fate of Ilion, plough'd the main, Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent, And thunder rolling shook the firmament.
<p/>Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife, Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife, Till Helen's woes at full revenged appear, And Troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.
<p/>Before that day, if any Greek invite His (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) country's troops to base, inglorious flight, Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) sail to fly, And die the dastard first, who dreads to die.
<p/>Among those counsels, let not mine be vain; In tribes and nations to divide thy train: His (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) separate troops let every leader call, Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sharpen'd spear let every Grecian wield, And every Grecian fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) brazen shield, Let all excite the fiery steeds of war, And all for combat fit the rattling car.

<p/>The hardy warriors whom Boeotia bred, Penelius, Leitus, Prothoenor, led: With these Arcesilaus and Clonius stand, Equal in arms, and equal in command.
<p/>These head the troops that rocky Aulis yields, And Eteon's hills, and Hyrie's watery fields, And Schoenos, Scholos, Graea near the main, And Mycalessia's ample piny plain; Those who in Peteon or Ilesion dwell, Or Harma where Apollo's prophet fell; Heleon and Hyle, which the springs o'erflow; And Medeon lofty, and Ocalea low; Or in the meads of Haliartus stray, Or Thespia sacred to the god of day:
<p/>Onchestus, Neptune's celebrated groves; Copae, and Thisbe, famed for silver doves; For flocks Erythrae, Glissa for the vine; Platea green, and Nysa the divine; And they whom Thebe's well-built walls inclose, Where Myde, Eutresis, Corone, rose; And Arne rich, with purple harvests crown'd; And Anthedon, Boeotia's utmost bound.

<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>), as their chief, the chosen troops attend, Which Bessa, Thronus, and rich Cynos send; Opus, Calliarus, and Scarphe's bands; And those who dwell where pleasing Augia stands, And where Boagrius floats the lowly lands, Or in fair Tarphe's sylvan seats reside: In forty vessels cut the yielding tide.
<p/>Euboea next her (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) martial sons prepares, And sends the brave Abantes to the wars: Breathing revenge, in arms they take their way From Chalcis' walls, and strong Eretria; The Isteian fields for generous vines renown'd, The fair Caristos, and the Styrian ground; Where Dios from her (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) towers o'erlooks the plain, And high Cerinthus views the neighbouring main.
<p/>Down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair; Their hands dismiss not the long lance in air; But with protended spears in fighting fields Pierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields.
<p/>These, ranged in order on the floating tide, Close, on the left, the bold Boeotians' side. Twice twenty ships transport the warlike bands, Which bold Elphenor, fierce in arms, commands.

<p/>No chief like thee, Menestheus! Greece could yield, To marshal armies in the dusty field, The extended wings of battle to display, Or close the embodied host in firm array.
<p/>Nestor alone, improved by length of days, For martial conduct bore an equal praise. With these appear the Salaminian bands, Whom the gigantic Telamon commands; In twelve black ships to Troy

<p/>they steer their course, And with the great Athenians join their force. Whom strong Tyrinthe's lofty walls surround, And Epidaure with viny harvests

<p/>Fair Araethyrea, Ornia's fruitful plain, And Ćgion, and Adrastus' ancient reign; And those who dwell along the sandy shore, And where Pellene yields her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) fleecy store, Where Helice and Hyperesia lie, And Gonoessa's spires salute the sky.
<p/>Great Agamemnon rules the numerous band, A hundred vessels in long order stand, And crowded nations wait his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) dread command. High on the deck the king of men appears, And
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) refulgent arms in triumph wears; Proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) host, unrivall'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) reign, In silent pomp he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) moves along the main.
<p/>The hardy Spartans, exercised in arms: Phares and Brysia's valiant troops, and those Whom Lacedaemon's lofty hills inclose; Or Messe's towers for silver doves renown'd, Amyclae, Laas, Augia's happy ground, And those whom OEtylos' low walls contain, And Helos, on the margin of the main:
<p/>Eager and loud from man to man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flies, Revenge and fury flaming in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes; While vainly fond, in fancy oft he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hears The fair one's grief, and sees her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) falling tears.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother follows, and to vengeance warms These, o'er the bending ocean, Helen's cause, In sixty ships with Menelaus draws: In ninety sail, from Pylos' sandy coast, Nestor the sage conducts his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) chosen host:
<p/>From Amphigenia's ever-fruitful land, Where Ćpy high, and little Pteleon stand; Where beauteous Arene her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) structures shows, And Thryon's walls Alpheus' streams inclose: And
<p/>Dorion, famed for Thamyris' disgrace, Superior once of all the tuneful race, Till, vain of mortals' empty praise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) strove To match the seed of cloud-compelling Jove!
<p/>Too daring bard! whose unsuccessful pride The immortal Muses in their art defied. The avenging Muses of the light of day Deprived his (<font color='blue'><b>bard</b></font>) eyes, and snatch'd
<p/>Where under high Cyllene, crown'd with wood, The shaded tomb of old Ćpytus stood; From Ripe, Stratie, Tegea's bordering towns, The Phenean fields, and Orchomenian downs, Where the fat herds in plenteous pasture rove; And Stymphelus with her (<font color='blue'><b>mortals</b></font>) surrounding grove; Parrhasia, on her (<font color='blue'><b>mortals</b></font>) snowy cliffs reclined, And high Enispe shook by wintry wind, And fair Mantinea's ever-pleasing site; In sixty sail the Arcadian bands unite.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>bard</b></font>) voice away; No more his (<font color='blue'><b>bard</b></font>) heavenly voice was heard to sing, His (<font color='blue'><b>bard</b></font>) hand no more awaked the silver string.

<p/>Their ships, supplied by Agamemnon's care, Through roaring seas the wondering warriors bear; The first to battle on the appointed plain, But new to all the dangers of the main.
<p/>Those, where fair Elis and Buprasium join; Whom Hyrmin, here, and Myrsinus confine, And bounded there, where o'er the valleys rose The Olenian rock; and where Alisium flows; Beneath four chiefs -LRB-a numerous army-RRB- came: The strength and glory of the Epean name.
<p/>In separate squadrons these their train divide, Each leads ten vessels through the yielding tide. One was Amphimachus, and Thalpius one;
<p/>But those who view fair Elis o'er the seas From the blest islands of the Echinades, In forty vessels under Meges move, Begot by Phyleus, the beloved of Jove: To strong Dulichium from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) sire he (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) fled, And thence to Troy his (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) hardy warriors led.
<p/>-LRB-Eurytus' this, and that Teatus' son;-RRB- Diores sprung from Amarynceus' line; And great Polyxenus, of force divine. Ulysses follow'd through the watery road,
<p/>With those whom Cephalenia's line inclosed, Or till their fields along the coast opposed; Or where fair Ithaca o'erlooks the floods, Where high Neritos shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) waving woods, Where Ćgilipa's rugged sides are seen, Crocylia rocky, and Zacynthus green.
<p/>A chief, in wisdom equal to a god. These in twelve galleys with vermilion prores, Beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) conduct sought the Phrygian shores.
<p/>Thoas came next, Andraemon's valiant son, From Pleuron's walls, and chalky Calydon, And rough Pylene, and the Olenian steep, And Chalcis, beaten by the rolling deep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) led the warriors from the Ćtolian shore, For now the sons of OEneus were no more! The glories of the mighty race were fled!
<p/>Next, eighty barks the Cretan king commands, Of Gnossus, Lyctus, and Gortyna's bands; And those who dwell where Rhytion's domes arise, Or white Lycastus glitters to the skies, Or where by Phaestus silver Jardan runs; Crete's hundred cities pour forth all her (<font color='blue'><b>bands</b></font>) sons.
<p/>OEneus himself, and Meleager dead! To Thoas' care now trust the martial train, His (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) forty vessels follow through the main. These march'd, Idomeneus, beneath thy care, And Merion, dreadful as the god of war.
<p/>Tlepolemus, the sun of Hercules, Led nine swift vessels through the foamy seas, From Rhodes, with everlasting sunshine bright, Jalyssus, Lindus, and Camirus white.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rhodes</b></font>) captive mother fierce Alcides bore From Ephyr's walls and Selle's winding shore, Where mighty towns in ruins spread the plain, And saw their blooming warriors early slain.
<p/>The hero, when to manly years he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) grew, Alcides' uncle, old Licymnius, slew; For this, constrain'd to quit his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) native place, And shun the vengeance of the Herculean race, A fleet he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) built, and with a numerous train Of willing exiles
<p/>wander'd o'er the main; Where, many seas and many sufferings past, On happy Rhodes the chief arrived at last: There in three tribes divides his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) native band, And rules them peaceful in a foreign land; Increased and prosper'd in their new abodes By mighty Jove, the sire of men and gods; With joy they saw the growing empire rise, And showers of wealth descending from the skies.
<p/>Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shore, Nireus, whom Aglae to Charopus bore, Nireus, in faultless shape and blooming grace,
<p/>The loveliest youth of all the Grecian race;-LRB-104-RRB- Pelides only match'd his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) early charms; But few his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) troops, and small his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) strength in arms.
<p/>Next thirty galleys cleave the liquid plain, Of those Calydnae's sea-girt isles contain; With them the youth of Nisyrus repair, Casus the strong, and Crapathus the fair;
<p/>Cos, where Eurypylus possess'd the sway, Till great Alcides made the realms obey: These Antiphus and bold Phidippus bring, Sprung from the god by Thessalus the king.
<p/>Now, Muse, recount Pelasgic Argos' powers, From Alos, Alope, and Trechin's towers: From Phthia's spacious vales; and Hella, bless'd With female beauty far beyond the rest.
<p/>Full fifty ships beneath Achilles' care, The Achaians, Myrmidons, Hellenians bear; Thessalians all, though various in their name; The same their nation, and their chief the same.
<p/>stretch'd along the shore, They hear the brazen voice of war no more; No more the foe they face in dire array: Close in his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) fleet the angry leader lay; Since fair Briseis from his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) arms was torn, The noblest spoil from sack'd Lyrnessus borne, Then, when the chief the Theban walls o'erthrew, And the bold sons of great Evenus slew.
<p/>But now inglorious, There mourn'd Achilles, plunged in depth of care, But soon to rise in slaughter, blood, and war. To these the youth of Phylace succeed, Itona, famous for her (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) fleecy breed, And grassy Pteleon deck'd with cheerful greens,
<p/>The bowers of Ceres, and the sylvan scenes. Sweet Pyrrhasus, with blooming flowerets crown'd, And Antron's watery dens, and cavern'd ground.
<p/>The first who boldly touch'd the Trojan shore, And dyed a Phrygian lance with Grecian gore; There lies, far distant from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) native plain; Unfinish'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) proud palaces remain, And his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sad consort beats her (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) breast in vain.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) troops in forty ships Podarces led, Iphiclus' son, and brother to the dead; Nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) unworthy to command the host; Yet still they mourn'd their ancient leader lost.
<p/>The men who Glaphyra's fair soil partake, Where hills incircle Boebe's lowly lake, Where Phaere hears the neighbouring waters fall, Or proud Iolcus lifts her (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) airy wall,
<p/>In ten black ships embark'd for Ilion's shore, With bold Eumelus, whom Alceste bore: All Pelias' race Alceste far outshined, The grace and glory of the beauteous kind, The troops Methone or Thaumacia yields, Olizon's rocks, or Meliboea's fields, With Philoctetes sail'd whose matchless art From the tough bow directs the feather'd dart.
<p/>These own'd, as chief, Protesilas the brave, Who now lay silent in the gloomy grave: Seven were his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) ships; each vessel fifty row, Skill'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) science of the dart and bow.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) lay raging on the Lemnian ground, A poisonous hydra gave the burning wound; There groan'd the chief in agonizing pain, Whom Greece at length shall wish, nor wish in vain.
<p/>The OEchalian race, in those high towers contain'd Where once Eurytus in proud triumph reign'd, Or where her (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) humbler turrets Tricca rears, Or where Ithome, rough with rocks, appears,
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) forces Medon led from Lemnos' shore, Oileus' son, whom beauteous Rhena bore. In thirty sail the sparkling waves divide, Which Podalirius and Machaon guide.

<p/>Fierce in the fight their nostrils breathed a flame, Their height, their colour, and their age the same; O'er fields of death they whirl the rapid car, And break the ranks, and thunder through the war.
<p/>Ajax in arms the first renown acquired, While stern Achilles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) wrath retired: -LRB-His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) was the strength that mortal might exceeds, And his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) the unrivall'd race of heavenly steeds:-RRB-
<p/>Say next, O Muse! of all Achaia breeds, Who bravest fought, or rein'd the noblest steeds? But Thetis' son now shines in arms no more; His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) troops, neglected on the sandy shore.
<p/>Unstain'd with blood his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cover'd chariots stand; The immortal coursers graze along the strand; But the brave chiefs the inglorious life deplored,
<p/>In empty air their sportive javelins throw, Or whirl the disk, or bend an idle bow: And, wandering o'er the camp, required their lord.
<p/>Now, like a deluge, covering all around, The shining armies sweep along the ground; Swift as a flood of fire, when storms arise, Floats the wild field, and blazes to the skies.
<p/>Earth groan'd beneath them; as when angry Jove Hurls down the forky lightning from above, On Arime when he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) the thunder throws, And fires Typhoeus with redoubled blows, Where Typhon, press'd beneath the burning load, Still feels the fury of the avenging god.
<p/>But various Iris, Jove's commands to bear, Speeds on the wings of winds through liquid air; In Priam's porch the Trojan chiefs she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) found, The old consulting, and the youths around.
<p/>Polites' shape, the monarch's son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) chose, Who from Ćsetes' tomb observed the foes,-LRB-105-RRB- High on the mound; from whence in prospect lay The fields, the tents, the navy, and the bay.
<p/>In this dissembled form, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) hastes to bring The unwelcome message to the Phrygian king. '' Cease to consult, the time for action calls; War, horrid war, approaches to your walls!
<p/>But ne'er till now such numbers charged a field: Thick as autumnal leaves or driving sand, The moving squadrons blacken all the strand.
<p/>Assembled armies oft have I beheld; Thou, godlike Hector! all thy force employ, Assemble all the united bands of Troy; In just array let every leader call The foreign troops: this day demands them all!''
<p/>The gates unfolding pour forth all their train, Nations on nations fill the dusky plain, Men, steeds, and chariots, shake the trembling ground: The tumult thickens, and the skies resound.
<p/>Amidst the plain, in sight of Ilion, stands A rising mount, the work of human hands; -LRB-This for Myrinne's tomb the immortals know, Though

<p/>The godlike Hector, high above the rest, Shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) huge spear, and nods his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) plumy crest: In throngs around his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) native bands repair, And groves of lances glitter in the air.
<p/>Divine Ćneas brings the Dardan race, Anchises' son, by Venus' stolen embrace, Born in the shades of Ida's secret grove; -LRB-A mortal mixing with the queen of love;-RRB- Archilochus and Acamas divide The warrior's toils, and combat by his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) side.

<p/>From rich Apaesus and Adrestia's towers, High Teree's summits, and Pityea's bowers; From these the congregated troops obey Young Amphius and Adrastus' equal sway;
<p/>Who fair Zeleia's wealthy valleys till,-LRB-106-RRB- Old Merops' sons; whom, skill'd in fates to come, The sire forewarn'd, and prophesied their doom: Fate urged them on!
<p/>the sire forewarn'd in vain, They rush'd to war, and perish'd on the plain. From Practius' stream, Percote's pasture lands, And Sestos and Abydos' neighbouring strands, From great Arisba's walls and Selle's coast,
<p/>Asius Hyrtacides conducts his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) host: High on his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) car he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) shakes the flowing reins, His (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) fiery coursers thunder o'er the plains.
<p/>The fierce Pelasgi next, in war renown'd, March from Larissa's ever-fertile ground: In equal arms their brother leaders shine, Hippothous bold, and Pyleus the divine.
<p/>Next Acamas and Pyrous lead their hosts, In dread array, from Thracia's wintry coasts; Round the bleak realms where Hellespontus roars, And Boreas beats the hoarse-resounding shores.
<p/>Pyraechmes the Paeonian troops attend, Skill'd in the fight their crooked bows to bend; From Axius' ample bed he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) leads them on, Axius, that laves the distant Amydon, Axius, that swells with all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) neighbouring rills, And wide around the floating region fills.
<p/>The Paphlagonians Pylaemenes rules, Where rich Henetia breeds her (<font color='blue'><b>Axius</b></font>) savage mules, Where Erythinus' rising cliffs are seen, Thy groves of box, Cytorus! ever green, And where Ćgialus and Cromna lie, And lofty
<p/>With great Euphemus the Ciconians move, Sprung from Troezenian Ceus, loved by Jove. Sesamus invades the sky, And where Parthenius, roll'd through banks of flowers, Reflects her (<font color='blue'><b>Axius</b></font>) bordering palaces and bowers.
<p/>Here march'd in arms the Halizonian band, Whom Odius and Epistrophus command, From those far regions where the sun refines The ripening silver in Alybean mines.
<p/>There mighty Chromis led the Mysian train, And augur Ennomus, inspired in vain; For stern Achilles lopp'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sacred head, Roll'd down Scamander with the vulgar dead.
<p/>Of those who round Maeonia's realms reside, Or whom the vales in shades of Tmolus hide, Mestles and Antiphus the charge partake, Born on the banks of Gyges' silent lake.
<p/>There, from the fields where wild Maeander flows, High Mycale, and Latmos' shady brows, And proud Miletus, came the Carian throngs, With mingled clamours and with barbarous tongues.-LRB-107-RRB-
<p/>, Naustes the bold, Amphimachus the vain, Who, trick'd with gold, and glittering on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scamander</b></font>) car, Rode like a woman to the field of war.
<p/>Phorcys and brave Ascanius here unite The Ascanian Phrygians, eager for the fight. Amphimachus and Naustes guide the train Fool that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>) was!
<p/>by fierce Achilles slain, The river swept him (<font color='blue'><b>Fool</b></font>) to the briny main: There whelm'd with waves the gaudy warrior lies The valiant victor seized the golden prize.
<p/>The forces last in fair array succeed, Which blameless Glaucus and Sarpedon lead The warlike bands that distant Lycia yields, Where gulfy Xanthus foams along the fields.
<p/>The armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon between Menelaus and Paris -LRB-by the intervention of Hector-RRB- for the determination of the war.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) leads her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) counsellers observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom Helen gives an account of the chief of them.
<p/>BOOK III. ARGUMENT. THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS. Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the fight. The kings on either part take the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat.
<p/>The duel ensues; wherein Paris being overcome, he (<font color='blue'><b>MENELAUS</b></font>) is snatched away in a cloud by Venus, and transported to his (<font color='blue'><b>MENELAUS</b></font>) apartment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) then calls Helen from the walls, and brings the lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the Grecians, demands the restoration of Helen, and the performance of the articles.
<p/>The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in Troy itself.
<p/>Thus by their leaders' care each martial band Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land. With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar, Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war
<p/>With noise, and order, through the midway sky; To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring, And all the war descends upon the wing,
<p/>So when inclement winters vex the plain With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain, To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,-LRB-108-RRB- But silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill'd-LRB-109-RRB-
<p/>By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field, Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around Darkening arises from the labour'd ground.
<p/>Thus from his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) flaggy wings when Notus sheds A night of vapours round the mountain heads, Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade, To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;
<p/>While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey, Lost and confused amidst the thicken'd day: So wrapp'd in gathering dust, the Grecian train, A moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.
<p/>Now front to front the hostile armies stand, Eager of fight, and only wait command; When, to the van, before the sons of fame Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:
<p/>: His (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) bended bow across his (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) shoulders flung, His (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) sword beside him (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) negligently hung; Two pointed spears he (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) shook with gallant grace, And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.
<p/>As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain, He (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) boldly stalk'd, the foremost on the plain, Him (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies, With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:
<p/>So joys a lion, if the branching deer, Or mountain goat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) bulky prize, appear; Eager he (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) seizes and devours the slain, Press'd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.
<p/>Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound, In clanging arms he (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) leaps upon the ground From his (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) high chariot: him (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>), approaching near,
<p/>The beauteous champion views with marks of fear, Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind, And shuns the fate he (<font color='blue'><b>Smit</b></font>) well deserved to find.
<p/>As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees-LRB-110-RRB- Shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees, Trembling and pale, he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) starts with wild affright
<p/>In form a god! the panther's speckled hide Flow'd o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) armour with an easy pride And all confused precipitates his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) flight:
<p/>So from the king the shining warrior flies, And plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies. As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat, He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) thus upbraids him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) with a generous heat: <div class="bookquote">``Unhappy Paris!
<p/>but to women brave!-LRB-111-RRB- So fairly form'd, and only to deceive! Oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw`st the light, Or died at least before thy nuptial rite!

<p/>In former days, in all thy gallant pride, When thy tall ships triumphant stemm'd the tide, When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow, And crowds stood wondering at the passing show, Say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien, You met the approaches of the Spartan queen, Thus from her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) realm
<p/>Thy figure promised with a martial air, But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair. convey'd the beauteous prize, And both her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) warlike lords outshined in Helen's eyes?
<p/>This deed, thy foes' delight, thy own disgrace, Thy father's grief, and ruin of thy race; This deed recalls thee to the proffer'd fight; Or hast thou injured
<p/>whom thou dar`st not right? Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know Thou keep`st the consort of a braver foe.
<p/>Thy graceful form instilling soft desire, Thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre, Beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust, When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust: Troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow Crush the dire author of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) country's woe.
<p/>Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks: But who like thee can boast a soul sedate, So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?
<p/>Thy force, like steel, a temper'd hardness shows, Still edged to wound, and still untired with blows, Like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain, With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.
<p/>Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms With which a lover golden Venus arms; Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show, No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.
<p/>Yet, would`st thou have the proffer'd combat stand, The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand; Then let a midway space our hosts divide,
<p/>And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried: By Paris there the Spartan king be fought, For beauteous Helen and the wealth she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) brought; And who his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) rival can in arms subdue, His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) be the fair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the treasure too.

<p/>Thus may the Greeks review their native shore, Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) said. Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried: <div class="bookquote">``Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:

<p/>While from the centre Hector rolls his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) eyes On either host, and thus to both applies: <div class="bookquote">``Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands, What Paris, author of the war, demands.

<p/>Your shining swords within the sheath restrain, And pitch your lances in the yielding plain. Let these the brave triumphant victor grace, And different nations part in leagues of peace.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Hector/HECTOR/Stern</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) spoke: in still suspense on either side Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied: ``Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right
<p/>A world engages in the toils of fight. To me the labour of the field resign; Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.
<p/>Fall he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) that must, beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) rival's arms; And live the rest, secure of future harms. Two lambs, devoted by your country's rite,
<p/>To earth a sable, to the sun a white, Prepare, ye Trojans! while a third we bring Select to Jove, the inviolable king.
<p/>Let reverend Priam in the truce engage, And add the sanction of considerate age; His (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) sons are faithless, headlong in debate, And youth itself an empty wavering state; Cool age advances, venerably wise,
<p/>Turns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes; Sees what befell, and what may yet befall, Concludes from both, and best provides for all.
<p/>The nations hear with rising hopes possess'd, And peaceful prospects dawn in every breast. Within the lines they drew their steeds around,
<p/>And from their chariots issued on the ground; Next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore, Laid their bright arms along the sable shore.
<p/>On either side the meeting hosts are seen With lances fix'd, and close the space between. Two heralds now, despatch'd to Troy, invite The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.
<p/>Meantime to beauteous Helen, from the skies The various goddess of the rainbow flies: -LRB-Like fair Laodice in form and face, The loveliest nymph of Priam's royal race:-RRB- Her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) in the palace, at her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) loom she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) found; The golden web her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) own sad story crown'd, The Trojan wars she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) weaved -LRB-herself the prize-RRB- And the dire triumphs of her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) fatal eyes.

<p/>Deprived of thee, the heartless Greeks no more Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore; Troy seized of Helen, and our glory lost, Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast; While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries, -LRB-And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies,-RRB- '

<p/>And dared to combat all those chiefs around: Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord; For Pallas strung his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) arm and edged his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) sword.
<p/>To bar his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) passage fifty warriors lay; Two heroes led the secret squadron on, Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon; Those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy vale.

<p/>In impious acts the guilty father died; The sons subdued, for Heaven was on their side. Far more than heirs of all our parents' fame, Our glories darken their diminish'd name.
<p/>: His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) high concern may well excuse this rage, Whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage: His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the first praise, were Ilion's towers o'erthrown, And, if we fail, the chief disgrace his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) own.

<p/>As when the winds, ascending by degrees,-LRB-138-RRB- First move the whitening surface of the seas, The billows float in order to the shore, The wave behind rolls on the wave before; Till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise, Foam o'er the rocks, and thunder to the skies.
<p/>So to the fight the thick battalions throng, Shields urged on shields, and men drove men along Sedate and silent move the numerous bands;
<p/>No sound, no whisper, but the chief's commands, Those only heard; with awe the rest obey, As if some god had snatch'd their voice away.
<p/>As when the fleecy flocks unnumber'd stand In wealthy folds, and wait the milker's hand, The hollow vales incessant bleating fills, The lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills: Such clamours rose from various nations round, Mix'd was the murmur, and confused the sound.
<p/>Each host now joins, and each a god inspires, These Mars incites, and those Minerva fires, Pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign; And discord raging bathes the purple plain; Discord!
<p/>Not so the Trojans; from their host ascends A general shout that all the region rends. dire sister of the slaughtering power,
<p/>Small at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) birth, but rising every hour, While scarce the skies her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) horrid head can bound, She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;-LRB-139-RRB-
<p/>The nations bleed, where'er her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) steps she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) turns, The groan still deepens, and the combat burns. Now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed, To armour armour, lance to lance opposed,
<p/>Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew, The sounding darts in iron tempests flew, Victors and vanquish'd join'd promiscuous cries, And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise; With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed, And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
<p/>As torrents roll, increased by numerous rills, With rage impetuous, down their echoing hills Rush to the vales, and pour'd along the plain.
<p/>Roar through a thousand channels to the main: The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound; So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.
<p/>The bold Antilochus the slaughter led, The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead: At great Echepolus the lance arrives, Razed his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) high crest, and through his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) helmet drives; Warm'd in the brain the brazen weapon lies, And shades eternal settle o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood Of force and fire , its walls besmear'd with blood. Him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), the bold leader of the Abantian throng,-LRB-140-RRB- Seized to despoil, and dragg'd the corpse along:
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) flank, unguarded by his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) ample shield, Admits the lance: he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) falls, and spurns the field; The nerves, unbraced, support his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) limbs no more; The soul comes floating in a tide of gore.
<p/>Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain; The war renews, the warriors bleed again: As o'er their prey rapacious wolves engage, Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.
<p/>But while he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) strove to tug the inserted dart, Agenor's javelin reach'd the hero's heart. In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell, Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;
<p/>Fair Simoisius, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) mother bore Amid the flocks on silver Simois' shore: The nymph descending from the hills of Ide, To seek her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) parents on his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) flowery side, Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy, And thence from Simois named the lovely boy.
<p/>So falls a poplar, that in watery ground Raised high the head, with stately branches crown'd, -LRB-Fell'd by some artist with his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) shining steel, To shape the circle of the bending wheel,-RRB- Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread, With all its beauteous honours on its head There, left a subject to the wind and rain, And scorch'd by suns, it withers on the plain
<p/>Short was his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) date! by dreadful Ajax slain, He (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) falls, and renders all their cares in vain! Thus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius lies
<p/>Stretch'd on the shore, and thus neglected dies. At Ajax, Antiphus his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) javelin threw; The pointed lance with erring fury flew, And Leucus, loved by wise Ulysses, slew.
<p/>This saw Ulysses, and with grief enraged, Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged; Arm'd with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) spear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) meditates the wound,
<p/>In act to throw; but cautious look'd around, Struck at his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) sight the Trojans backward drew, And trembling heard the javelin as it flew.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) drops the corpse of Simoisius slain, And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain. A chief stood nigh, who from Abydos came, Old Priam's son, Democoon was his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name.
<p/>The weapon entered close above his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ear, Cold through his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) temples glides the whizzing spear;-LRB-141-RRB- With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) breath, His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eye-balls darken with the shades of death; Ponderous he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) falls;
<p/>Seized with affright the boldest foes appear; E'en godlike Hector seems himself to fear; Slow he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) gave way, the rest tumultuous fled; The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead: But Phoebus now from Ilion's towering height Shines forth reveal'd, and animates the fight.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) clanging arms resound, And his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) broad buckler rings against the ground. '' Trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;
<p/>Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes! Nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb'd with steel; Your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.
<p/>Have ye forgot what seem'd your dread before? The great, the fierce Achilles fights no more. '' Apollo thus from Ilion's lofty towers, Array'd in terrors, roused the Trojan powers:
<p/>While war's fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe, And shouts and thunders in the fields below. Then great Diores fell, by doom divine, In vain his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) valour and illustrious line.
<p/>A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw, -LRB-Who from cold Ćnus led the Thracian crew,-RRB--LRB-142-RRB- Full on his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) ankle dropp'd
<p/>Supine he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) tumbles on the crimson sands, Before his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) helpless friends, and native bands, And spreads for aid his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) unavailing hands.
<p/>the ponderous stone, Burst the strong nerves, and crash'd the solid bone. The foe rush'd furious as he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) pants for breath,
<p/>And through his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) navel drove the pointed death: His (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) gushing entrails smoked upon the ground, And the warm life came issuing from the wound.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent, Deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) breast above the pap it went, Amid the lungs was fix'd the winged wood, And quivering in his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) heaving bosom stood:
<p/>Till from the dying chief, approaching near, The Ćtolian warrior tugg'd his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) weighty spear: Then sudden waved his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) flaming falchion round,
<p/>To spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) arms the victor strove in vain; The Thracian bands against the victor press'd, A grove of lances glitter'd at his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) breast.
<p/>And gash'd his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) belly with a ghastly wound; The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain, Stern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes, In sullen fury slowly quits the prize.
<p/>Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace, And one the leader of the Epeian race; Death's sable shade at once o'ercast their eyes, In dust the vanquish'd and the victor lies.
<p/>Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld, By Pallas guarded through the dreadful field; Might darts be bid to turn their points away, And swords around him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) innocently play; The war's whole art with wonder had he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) seen, And counted heroes where he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) counted men.
<p/>With copious slaughter all the fields are red, And heap'd with growing mountains of the dead. So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,
<p/>And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired. -LSB-Illustration: Map of the Plain of Troy.-RSB- Map of the Plain of Troy. BOOK V. ARGUMENT.
<p/>Pandarus wounds him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) with an arrow, but the goddess cures him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>), enables him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) from contending with any of the former, excepting Venus.
<p/>Ćneas joins Pandarus to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>); Pandarus is killed, and Ćneas in great danger but for the assistance of Venus; who, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) is removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) son from the fight, is wounded on the hand by Diomed.
<p/>Apollo seconds her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rescue, and at length carries off Ćneas to Troy, where he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is healed in the temple of Pergamus.
<p/>THE ACTS OF DIOMED. Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day's battle. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand.
<p/>In the meantime Ćneas is restored to the field, and they overthrow several of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon.
<p/>Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed to go against that god; he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) wounds him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), and sends him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) groaning to heaven.
<p/>The first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as in the former. But Pallas now Tydides' soul inspires,-LRB-143-RRB-
<p/>Fills with her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) force, and warms with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) fires, Above the Greeks his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) deathless fame to raise, And crown her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) hero with distinguish'd praise.
<p/>High on his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) helm celestial lightnings play, His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) beamy shield emits a living ray; The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies, Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies, When fresh he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) rears his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) radiant orb to sight, And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.
<p/>Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow'd, Such, from his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) arms, the fierce effulgence flow'd: Onward she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) drives him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), furious to engage, Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.
<p/>The sons of Dares first the combat sought, A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault; In Vulcan's fane the father's days were led, The sons to toils of glorious battle bred; These singled from their troops the fight maintain, These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.
<p/>Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near, And first bold Phegeus cast his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sounding spear, Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course, And spent in empty air its erring force.
<p/>Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain, But pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) breast, and stretch'd him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on the plain. Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled, Left the rich chariot, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brother dead.
<p/>And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid, He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too had sunk to death's eternal shade; But in a smoky cloud the god of fire Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.
<p/>Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew, Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view; When by the blood-stain'd hand Minerva
<p/>The steeds and chariot, to the navy led, Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed. press'd The god of battles, and this speech address'd: <div class="bookquote">``Stern power of war!
<p/>Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide; And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide: While we from interdicted fields retire, Nor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) words allay the impetuous warrior's heat, The god of arms and martial maid retreat; Removed from fight, on Xanthus' flowery bounds They sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.
<p/>Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue, And some bold chieftain every leader slew: First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) death ennobled by Atrides' hand: As he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) to flight his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) wheeling car address'd, The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.
<p/>by whom the mighty fall, Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall! ''  (<font color='red'><b>The god address</b></font>)</div>In dust the mighty Halizonian lay, His (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) arms resound, the spirit wings its way.
<p/>Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom'd to feel The great Idomeneus' protended steel; Whom Borus sent -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) son and only joy-RRB-
<p/>The Cretan javelin reach'd him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) from afar, And pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) mounts his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) car; Back from the car he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) tumbles to the ground, And everlasting shades his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) eyes surround.
<p/>Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase, In woods and wilds to wound the savage race; Diana taught him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) sylvan arts, To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:
<p/>But vainly here Diana's arts he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) tries, The fatal lance arrests him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) flies; From Menelaus' arm the weapon sent, Through his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) broad back and heaving bosom went:
<p/>From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy. Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound, His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) brazen armour rings against the ground.
<p/>Next artful Phereclus untimely fell; Bold Merion sent him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) to the realms of hell. Thy father's skill, O Phereclus! was thine
<p/>, The graceful fabric and the fair design; For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart To him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the shipwright's and the builder's art.
<p/>The fatal cause of all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) country's woes; But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), the mystic will of heaven unknown, Nor saw his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) country's peril, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own.
<p/>Beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand the fleet of Paris rose, The hapless artist, while confused he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fled, The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.
<p/>Through his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) right hip, with forceful fury cast, Between the bladder and the bone it pass'd; Prone on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knees he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) falls with fruitless cries, And death in lasting slumber seals his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>From Meges' force the swift Pedaeus fled, Antenor's offspring from a foreign bed, Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair, Nursed the young stranger with a mother's care.
<p/>How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear Full in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) nape infix'd the fatal spear; Swift through his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) crackling jaws the weapon glides, And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.
<p/>Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine, Sprung from the brave Dolopion's mighty line, Who near adored Scamander made abode, Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.
<p/>On him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), amidst the flying numbers found, Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound; On his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) broad shoulders fell the forceful brand, Thence glancing downwards, lopp'd his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) holy hand, Which stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand.
<p/>Down sunk the priest : the purple hand of death Closed his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) dim eye, and fate suppress'd his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) breath. Thus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engaged.
<p/>In every quarter fierce Tydides raged; Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train, Rapt through the ranks he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) thunders o'er the plain; Now here, now there, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) darts from place to place,
<p/>Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face. Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,
<p/>Through ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds, O'erwhelm's the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds; The yellow harvests of the ripen'd year, And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!-LRB-144-RRB-
<p/>While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain, And all the labours of mankind are vain. So raged Tydides, boundless in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) ire, Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.
<p/>With grief the leader of the Lycian band Saw the wide waste of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) destructive hand: His (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) bended bow against the chief he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) drew; Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew, Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,
<p/>Deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) shoulder pierced, and drank the gore: The rushing stream his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) brazen armour dyed, While the proud archer thus exulting cried: <div class="bookquote">``Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!
<p/>by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds, Not long the deathful dart he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) can sustain; Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain.
<p/>Lo! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the archer</b></font>)</div>So spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Lo</b></font>), boastful: but the winged dart Stopp'd short of life, and mock'd the shooter's art. The wounded chief, behind his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) car retired, The helping hand of Sthenelus required;
<p/>Swift from his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) seat he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) leap'd upon the ground, And tugg'd the weapon from the gushing wound; When thus the king his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) guardian power address'd, The purple current wandering o'er
<p/>If e'er my godlike sire deserved thy aid, If e'er I felt thee in the fighting field; Now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) vest: <div class="bookquote">``O progeny of Jove! unconquer'd maid! O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight, Whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard`st in fight
<p/>Thus pray'd Tydides, and Minerva heard, His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) nerves confirm'd, his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) languid spirits cheer'd; He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) feels each limb with wonted vigour light;
<p/>; And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore, That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) beating bosom claim'd the promised fight.
<p/>in every combat shine, War be thy province, thy protection mine; Rush to the fight, and every foe control; Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul: Strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me, And all thy godlike father breathes in thee; Yet more, from mortal mists
<p/>'' Be bold, -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) cried-RRB-, I purge thy eyes,-LRB-145-RRB- And set to view the warring deities. These see thou shun, through all the embattled plain; Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.
<p/>If Venus mingle in the martial band, Her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command. '' With that, the blue-eyed virgin wing'd her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) flight;
<p/>The hero rush'd impetuous to the fight; With tenfold ardour now invades the plain, Wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.
<p/>As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls, Amidst the field a brindled lion falls; If chance some shepherd with a distant dart The savage wound, he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) rouses at the smart,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) foams, he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) roars; the shepherd dares not stay, But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey; Heaps fall on heaps; he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) bathes with blood the ground, Then leaps victorious o'er the lofty mound.
<p/>And two brave leaders at an instant slew; Astynous breathless fell, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) side, His (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) people's pastor, good Hypenor, died; Astynous' breast the deadly lance receives, Hypenor's shoulder his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) broad falchion cleaves.
<p/>Those slain he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) left, and sprung with noble rage Abas and Polyidus to engage; Sons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old, Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold; The youths return'd not from the doubtful plain, And the sad father tried his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arts in vain; No mystic dream could make their fates appear, Though now determined by Tydides' spear.
<p/>Young Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) rage; The joy and hope of Phaenops' feeble age: Vast was his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) wealth, and these the only heirs Of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) labours and a life of cares.
<p/>Cold death o'ertakes them in their blooming years, And leaves the father unavailing tears: To strangers now descends his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heapy store, The race forgotten, and the name no more.
<p/>Not with less fury stern Tydides flew; Two sons of Priam in one chariot ride, Glittering in arms, and combat side by side.
<p/>As when the lordly lion seeks his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) food Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood, He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) leaps amidst them with a furious bound,
<p/>Bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground: So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn, Their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.
<p/>The foe prevailing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) friends pursued; Through the thick storm of singing spears he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) flies, Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) found Lycaon's mighty son; To whom the chief of Venus' race begun: ``Where, Pandarus, are all thy honours now, Thy winged arrows and unerring bow, Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall'd fame, And boasted glory of the Lycian name?
<p/>O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call That wondrous force by which whole armies fall; Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice; -LRB-Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!
<p/>With deep concern divine Ćneas view'd For what so dreadful as celestial hate-RRB-? Whoe'er he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) be, propitiate Jove with prayer; If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) the Lycian: <div class="bookquote">``Whom your eyes behold, If right I judge, is Diomed the bold: Such coursers whirl him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) o'er the dusty field, So towers his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) helmet, and so flames his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) shield.
<p/>If 'tis a god, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) wears that chief's disguise: Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies, Involved in clouds, protects him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) in the fray, And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I wing'd an arrow, which not idly fell, The stroke had fix'd him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) to the gates of hell; And, but some god, some angry god withstands, His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fate was due to these unerring hands.
<p/>Skill'd in the bow, on foot I sought the war, Nor join'd swift horses to the rapid car. Ten polish'd chariots I possess'd at home,
<p/>And still they grace Lycaon's princely dome: There veil'd in spacious coverlets they stand; And twice ten coursers wait their lord's command.
<p/>The good old warrior bade me trust to these, When first for Troy I sail'd the sacred seas; In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide, And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.
<p/>But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined, I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) counsels with unheedful mind, And thought the steeds -LRB-your large supplies unknown-RRB- Might fail of forage in the straiten'd town
<p/>; So took my bow and pointed darts in hand And left the chariots in my native land. '' Too late, O friend!
<p/>my rashness I deplore ; These shafts, once fatal, carry death no more. Tydeus' and Atreus' sons their points have found, And undissembled gore pursued the wound.
<p/>In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe. In evil hour these bended horns I strung, And seized the quiver where it idly hung.
<p/>Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field Without a warrior's arms, the spear and shield! If e'er with life I quit the Trojan plain,
<p/>If e'er I see my spouse and sire again, This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims, Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames.
<p/>'' To whom the leader of the Dardan race: <div class="bookquote">``Be calm, nor Phoebus' honour'd gift disgrace. The distant dart be praised, though here we need The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.
<p/>Now mount my seat, and from the chariot's height Observe my father's steeds, renown'd in fight; Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase, To dare the shock, or urge the rapid race; Secure with these, through fighting fields we go; Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.
<p/>Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein; The warrior's fury let this arm sustain; Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline, Take thou the spear, the chariot's care be mine.

<p/>And now both heroes mount the glittering car; The bounding coursers rush amidst the war; Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,

<p/>At this the hero cast a gloomy look, Fix'd on the chief with scorn; and thus he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) spoke: <div class="bookquote">``Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?

<p/>I hate the cumbrous chariot's slow advance, And the long distance of the flying lance; But while my nerves are strong, my force entire, Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.
<p/>Know, 'tis not honest in my soul to fear, Nor was Tydides born to tremble here. Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;
<p/>But if she (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) dooms, and if no god withstand, That both shall fall by one victorious hand, Then heed my words: my horses here detain, Fix'd to the chariot by the straiten'd rein; Swift to Ćneas' empty seat proceed, And seize the coursers of ethereal breed; The race of those, which once the thundering god-LRB-146-RRB-
<p/>One chief at least beneath this arm shall die; So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly. For ravish'd Ganymede on

<p/>Through the wide world should make our glory known. '' Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on, And stern Lycaon's warlike race begun: ``Prince, thou art met.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung; On his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) broad shield the sounding weapon rung, Pierced the tough orb, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) cuirass hung, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) bleeds!

<p/>Full in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) face it enter'd, and betwixt The nose and eye-ball the proud Lycian fix'd; Crash'd all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) jaws, and cleft the tongue within, Till the bright point look'd out beneath the chin.
<p/>Headlong he (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) falls, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) helmet knocks the ground: Earth groans beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) arms resound; The starting coursers tremble with affright; The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.
<p/>To guard his (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) slaughter'd friend, Ćneas flies, His (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) spear extending where the carcase lies; Watchful he (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) wheels, protects it every way,

<p/>the Greeks with longing eyes Behold at distance, but forbear the prize. Then fierce Tydides stoops; and from the fields Heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.

<p/>There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway'd, Oppress'd had sunk to death's eternal shade, But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love She (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) bore Anchises in the Idaean grove, His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) danger views with anguish and despair, And guards her (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) offspring with a mother's care.

<p/>Strong as thou art, some god may yet be found, To stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground; Thy distant wife, Ćgiale the fair,-LRB-151-RRB- Starting from sleep with a distracted air, Shall rouse thy slaves, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lost lord deplore, The brave, the great, the glorious now no more!''
<p/>This said, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wiped from Venus' wounded palm The sacred ichor, and infused the balm. Juno and Pallas with a smile survey'd,
<p/>to tell How this mischance the Cyprian queen befell, As late she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) tried with passion to inflame The tender bosom of a Grecian dame
<p/>; Allured the fair, with moving thoughts of joy, To quit her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) country for some youth of Troy; The clasping zone, with golden buckles bound, Razed her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) soft hand with this lamented wound.
<p/>The sire of gods and men superior smiled, And, calling Venus, thus address'd his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) child: ``Not these, O daughter are thy proper cares, Thee milder arts befit, and softer wars; Sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms; To Mars and Pallas leave the deeds of arms.
<p/>Thus they in heaven: while on the plain below The fierce Tydides charged his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) Dardan foe, Flush'd with celestial blood pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) way, And fearless dared the threatening god of day; Already in his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) kill'd, Though screen'd behind Apollo's mighty shield.
<p/>Thrice rushing furious, at the chief he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) strook; His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook: He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud, A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.
<p/>And thus to Jove began the blue-eyed maid: <div class="bookquote">``Permit thy daughter, gracious Jove! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>'' '' O son of Tydeus, cease! be wise and see How vast the difference of the gods and thee;
<p/>Distance immense! between the powers that shine Above, eternal, deathless, and divine, And mortal man! a wretch of humble birth, A short-lived reptile in the dust of earth.
<p/>'' So spoke the god who darts celestial fires: He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) dreads his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fury, and some steps retires. Then Phoebus bore the chief of Venus' race To Troy's high fane, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) holy place;
<p/>This done, the patron of the silver bow A phantom raised, the same in shape and show With great Ćneas; such the form he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) bore, And such in fight the radiant arms he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) wore.
<p/>Latona there and Phoebe heal'd the wound, With vigour arm'd him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), and with glory crown'd. Around the spectre bloody wars are waged, And Greece and Troy with clashing shields engaged.
<p/>``Stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall; Who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall, Rise in thy wrath!
<p/>Meantime on Ilion's tower Apollo stood, And calling Mars, thus urged the raging god: to hell's abhorr'd abodes Despatch yon Greek, and vindicate the gods.
<p/>First rosy Venus felt his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) brutal rage; Me next he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) charged, and dares all heaven engage: The wretch would brave high heaven's immortal sire, His (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) triple thunder, and his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) bolts of fire.
<p/>The god of battle issues on the plain, Stirs all the ranks, and fires the Trojan train; In form like Acamas, the Thracian guide, Enraged to Troy's retiring chiefs he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) cried: <div class="bookquote">``How long, ye sons of Priam! will ye fly, And
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>unrevenged see Priam's people die? Still unresisted shall the foe destroy, And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?
<p/>Lo, brave Ćneas sinks beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Lo</b></font>) wound, Not godlike Hector more in arms renown'd: Haste all, and take the generous warrior's part.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) said;--new courage swell'd each hero's heart. Sarpedon first his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) ardent soul express'd, And, turn'd to Hector, these bold words address'd: <div class="bookquote">``Say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?
<p/>Where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast, That propp'd alone by Priam's race should stand Troy's sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?
<p/>Now, now thy country calls her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) wonted friends, And the proud vaunt in just derision ends. Remote they stand while alien troops engage, Like trembling hounds before the lion's rage.
<p/>Far distant hence I held my wide command, Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land; With ample wealth -LRB-the wish of mortals-RRB- bless'd, A beauteous wife, and infant at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breast; With those I left whatever dear could be: Greece, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) conquers, nothing wins from me;
<p/>Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer, And long to meet this mighty man ye fear; While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave Their wives, their infants, and their altars save.
<p/>Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten'd state, Or one vast burst of all-involving fate Full o'er your towers shall fall, and sweep away Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish'd prey.
<p/>Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight; These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night; With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose; Such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hector/HECTOR/Stern</b></font>)</div><p/>Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears, But just reproof with decent silence bears. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) proud car the prince impetuous springs, On earth he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) leaps, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) brazen armour rings.
<p/>Two shining spears are brandish'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) hands; Thus arm'd, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) animates his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) drooping bands, Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight, And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.
<p/>As when, on Ceres' sacred floor, the swain Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain, And the light chaff, before the breezes borne, Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn; The grey dust, rising with collected winds, Drives o'er the barn, and whitens all the hinds: So white with dust the Grecian host appears.
<p/>From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers; The dusky clouds from labour'd earth arise, And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.
<p/>They turn, they stand; the Greeks their fury dare, Condense their powers, and wait the growing war. Mars hovers o'er them with his (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) sable shield, And adds new horrors to the darken'd field:
<p/>Pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) charge, and ardent to fulfil, In Troy's defence, Apollo's heavenly will: Soon as from fight the blue-eyed maid retires, Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) fires.
<p/>And now the god, from forth his (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) sacred fane, Produced Ćneas to the shouting train; Alive, unharm'd, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) peers around,
<p/>Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day No pause of words admits, no dull delay; Fierce Discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims, Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field's in flames.
<p/>Erect he (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) stood, and vigorous from his (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) wound: Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood, And great Ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.
<p/>Embodied close, the labouring Grecian train The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain. Unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait Serenely dreadful, and as fix'd as fate.
<p/>So when the embattled clouds in dark array, Along the skies their gloomy lines display; When now the North his (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) boisterous rage has spent, And peaceful sleeps the liquid element:
<p/>The low-hung vapours, motionless and still, Rest on the summits of the shaded hill; Till the mass scatters as the winds arise, Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.
<p/>Nor was the general wanting to his (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) train; From troop to troop he (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) toils through all the plain, <div class="bookquote">``Ye Greeks, be men!
<p/>the charge of battle bear; Your brave associates and yourselves revere! Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire, And catch from breast to breast the noble fire!
<p/>On valour's side the odds of combat lie, The brave live glorious, or lamented die; The wretch who trembles in the field of fame, Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>These words he (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) seconds with his (<font color='blue'><b>hinds</b></font>) flying lance, To meet whose point was strong Deicoon's chance: Ćneas' friend, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) native place Honour'd and loved like Priam's royal race: Long had he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) fought the foremost in the field, But now the monarch's lance transpierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) shield: His (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) shield too weak the furious dart to stay, Through his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) broad belt the weapon forced its way:
<p/>The grisly wound dismiss'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) soul to hell, His (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) arms around him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) rattled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) fell. Then fierce Ćneas, brandishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) blade, In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid, Whose sire Diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,
<p/>In well-built Pherae held his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) lofty seat:-LRB-152 -RRB- Sprung from Alpheus' plenteous stream, that yields Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields.
<p/>In sable ships they left their native soil, To avenge Atrides: now, untimely slain, They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) got Orsilochus, Diocleus he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>), And these descended in the third degree. Too early expert in the martial toil, So two young mountain lions, nursed with blood
<p/>In deep recesses of the gloomy wood, Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll'd Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:
<p/>Till pierced at distance from their native den, O'erpowered they fall beneath the force of men. Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay, Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.
<p/>Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes, Lifts his (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) bright lance, and at the victor flies; Mars urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) on; yet, ruthless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) hate,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) thus advancing, Nestor's valiant son Shakes for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) danger, and neglects his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own; Struck with the thought, should Helen's lord be slain, And all his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) country's glorious labours vain.
<p/>The god but urged him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to provoke his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) fate. Already met, the threatening heroes stand; The spears already tremble in their hand: In rush'd
<p/>Antilochus, his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) aid to bring, And fall or conquer by the Spartan king. These seen, the Dardan backward turn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) course, Brave as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was, and shunn'd unequal force.
<p/>The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew, Then mix in combat, and their toils renew. First, Pylaemenes, great in battle, bled,
<p/>Who sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led. Atrides mark'd him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) where sublime he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) stood; Fix'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) throat the javelin drank his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) blood.
<p/>The faithful Mydon, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) turn'd from fight His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) flying coursers, sunk to endless night; A broken rock by Nestor's son was thrown: His (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) bended arm received the falling stone; From his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) numb'd hand the ivory-studded reins, Dropp'd in the dust, are trail'd along the plains:
<p/>Meanwhile his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) temples feel a deadly wound; He (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground: Deep drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) helmet in the sands, and there The head stood fix'd, the quivering legs in air,
<p/>Till trampled flat beneath the coursers' feet: The youthful victor mounts his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) empty seat, And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.
<p/>the Trojan troops pursue: He (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) fires his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) host with animating cries, And brings along the furies of the skies, Mars, stern destroyer!
<p/>Great Hector saw, and, raging at the view, Pours on the Greeks: and Bellona dread, Flame in the front, and thunder at their head
<p/>: This swells the tumult and the rage of fight; That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light. Where Hector march'd, the god of battles shined, Now storm'd before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), and now raged behind.
<p/>As when some simple swain his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) cot forsakes, And wide through fens an unknown journey takes: If chance a swelling brook his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) passage stay, And foam impervious `cross the wanderer's way, Confused he (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) stops, a length of country pass'd, Eyes the rough waves, and tired, returns at last.
<p/>Tydides paused amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) full career; Then first the hero's manly breast knew fear. Amazed no less the great Tydides stands:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No wonder, Greeks! that all to Hector yield; Secure of favouring gods, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) takes the field; His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) strokes they second, and avert our spears.

<p/>Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew; And first two leaders valiant Hector slew: His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) force Anchialus and Mnesthes found,

<p/>Shook with his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) fall his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) brazen armour rung, And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung; Around his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) head an iron tempest rain'd; A wood of spears his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) ample shield sustain'd:
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) massy spear with matchless fury sent, Through Amphius' belt and heaving belly went; Amphius Apaesus' happy soil Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) press'd,
<p/>And drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) javelin from the bleeding breast: He (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) could no more; the showering darts denied To spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) glittering arms, and plumy pride.
<p/>Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields, With bristling lances, and compacted shields; Till in the steely circle straiten'd round, Forced he (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) gives way, and sternly quits the ground.
<p/>While thus they strive, Tlepolemus the great,-LRB-153-RRB- Urged by the force of unresisted fate, Burns with desire Sarpedon's strength to prove
<p/>; Alcides' offspring meets the son of Jove. Sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on. Jove's great descendant, and his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) greater son.
<p/>Prepared for combat, ere the lance he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) toss'd, The daring Rhodian vents his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) haughty boast: <div class="bookquote">``What brings this Lycian counsellor so far, To tremble at our arms, not mix in war!

<p/>But what art thou, who deedless look`st around, While unrevenged thy Lycians bite the ground! Small aid to Troy thy feeble force can be;

<p/>But you, unworthy the high race you boast, Shall raise my glory when thy own is lost: Now meet thy fate, and by Sarpedon slain, Add one more ghost to Pluto's gloomy reign.
<p/>Nor so content, the generous chief defied, With base reproaches and unmanly pride. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The king</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) said: both javelins at an instant flew; Both struck, both wounded, but Sarpedon's slew:

<p/>Yet not in vain, Tlepolemus, was thrown Thy angry lance; which piercing to the bone Sarpedon's thigh, had robb'd the chief of breath;

<p/>The generous Greeks recede with tardy pace, Though Mars and Hector thunder in their face; None turn their backs to mean ignoble flight, Slow they retreat, and even retreating fight.
<p/>But Boreas rising fresh, with gentle breath, Recall'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) spirit from the gates of death. Who first, who last, by Mars' and Hector's hand, Stretch'd in their blood, lay gasping on the sand?

<p/>-LSB-Illustration: JUNO.-RSB- JUNO. BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. THE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED, AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE. The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail.
<p/>Helenus, the chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the temple of Minerva, to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) to remove Diomed from the fight.
<p/>The battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have an interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of the friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they make exchange of their arms.
<p/>Hector, having performed the orders of Helenus, prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a tender leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.
<p/>Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield To human force and human skill the field: Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes; Now here, now there, the tide of combat flows; While Troy's famed streams, that bound the deathful plain On either side, run purple to the main.
<p/>The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois and Scamander, and then changes to Troy. Great Ajax
<p/>first to conquest led the way, Broke the thick ranks, and turn'd the doubtful day. The Thracian Acamas his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) falchion found,
<p/>Where the black horse-hair nodded o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) crest; Fix'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) front the brazen weapon lies, And seals in endless shades his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) swimming eyes.
<p/>Next Teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood, Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good: In fair Arisbe's walls -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) native place-RRB--LRB-161-RRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) seat!
<p/>And hew'd the enormous giant to the ground; His (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) thundering arm a deadly stroke impress'd a friend to human race. Fast by the road, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ever-open door Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.
<p/>To stern Tydides now he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) falls a prey, No friend to guard him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in the dreadful day! Breathless the good man fell, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faithful servant, old Calesius died.
<p/>Two twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young, From a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung: -LRB-Laomedon's white flocks Bucolion fed, That monarch's first-born by a foreign bed; In secret woods he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) won the naiad's grace, And two fair infants crown'd his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) strong embrace:-RRB- Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms; The ruthless victor stripp'd their shining arms.
<p/>Astyalus by Polypoetes fell; Ulysses' spear Pidytes sent to hell; By Teucer's shaft brave Aretaon bled, And Nestor's son laid stern Ablerus dead; Great Agamemnon, leader of the brave, The mortal wound of rich Elatus gave, Who held in Pedasus his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) proud abode,-LRB-162-RRB- And till'd the banks where silver Satnio flow'd. Melanthius by Eurypylus was slain; And Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.
<p/>By great Euryalus was Dresus slain, And next he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) laid Opheltius on the plain. Unbless'd Adrastus next at mercy lies Beneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) headlong steeds, precipitate in flight, Rush'd on a tamarisk's strong trunk, and broke The shatter'd chariot from the crooked yoke; Wide o'er the field, resistless as the wind, For Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.
<p/>Atrides o'er him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) vengeful steel; The fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd The victor's knees, and thus his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) prayer address'd:

<p/>thus the vigorous combat wage; No son of Mars descend, for servile gains, To touch the booty, while a foe remains.

<p/>on whom the immortals lay The cares and glories of this doubtful day; On whom your aids, your country's hopes depend; Wise to consult, and active to defend!
<p/>Here, at our gates, your brave efforts unite, Turn back the routed, and forbid the flight, Ere yet their wives' soft arms the cowards gain, The sport and insult of the hostile train.
<p/>When your commands have hearten'd every band, Ourselves, here fix'd, will make the dangerous stand; Press'd as we are, and sore of former fight, These straits demand our last remains of might.
<p/>Meanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire, And teach our mother what the gods require: Direct the queen to lead the assembled train Of Troy's chief matrons to Minerva's fane;-LRB-166-RRB- Unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power, With offer'd vows, in Ilion's topmost tower.

<p/>If so the power, atoned by fervent prayer, Our wives, our infants, and our city spare, And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire, That mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire; Not thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread, Sprung though he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) was from more than mortal bed; Not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,
<p/>Hector obedient heard: and, with a bound, Leap'd from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) trembling chariot to the ground; Through all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) host inspiring force he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) flies, And bids the thunder of the battle rise.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye generous chiefs! In rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Trojans</b></font>)</div>With rage recruited the bold Trojans glow, And turn the tide of conflict on the foe:

<p/>And think`st thou not how wretched we shall be, A widow I, a helpless orphan he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? For sure such courage length of life denies, And thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice.
<p/>Greece in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) single heroes strove in vain; Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain. O grant me, gods, ere Hector meets his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) doom,
<p/>All I can ask of heaven, an early tomb! So shall my days in one sad tenor run, And end with sorrows as they first begun.
<p/>No parent now remains my griefs to share, No father's aid, no mother's tender care. The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire, Laid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire!
<p/>Stern as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) yet revered the dead, His (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil, And laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) decent on the funeral pile; Then raised a mountain where his (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) bones were burn'd, The mountain-nymphs the rural tomb adorn'd, Jove's sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow
<p/>By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell; In one sad day beheld the gates of hell; While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed, Amid their fields the hapless heroes bled!
<p/>My mother lived to wear the victor's bands, The queen of Hippoplacia's sylvan lands: Redeem'd too late, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) scarce beheld again Her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) pleasing empire and her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) native plain, When ah! oppress'd by life-consuming woe, She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) fell a victim to Diana's bow.

<p/>my parents, brothers, kindred, all Once more will perish, if my Hector fall, Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share:
<p/>That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy, Where yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy; Thou, from this tower defend the important post; There Agamemnon points his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) dreadful host, That pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain,

<p/>As thine, Andromache! Thy griefs I dread: I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led! In Argive looms our battles to design, And woes, of which so large a part was thine!
<p/>To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring The weight of waters from Hyperia's spring. There while you groan beneath the load of life, They cry, `Behold the mighty Hector's wife!'
<p/>Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see, Imbitters all thy woes, by naming me. The thoughts of glory past, and present shame, A thousand griefs shall waken at the name!
<p/>May I lie cold before that dreadful day, Press'd with a load of monumental clay! Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep, Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep.

<p/>With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled, And Hector hasted to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) child, The glittering terrors from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) brows unbound, And placed the beaming helmet on the ground;

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) spoke, and fondly gazing on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) charms, Restored the pleasing burden to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms; Soft on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fragrant breast the babe she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laid, Hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.

<p/>And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued: <div class="bookquote">``Andromache! my soul's far better part, Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?
<p/>No hostile hand can antedate my doom, Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb. Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth;
<p/>And such the hard condition of our birth: No force can then resist, no flight can save, All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.
<p/>No more--but hasten to thy tasks at home, There guide the spindle, and direct the loom: Me glory summons to the martial scene, The field of combat is the sphere for men.
<p/>Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim, The first in danger as the first in fame. ''  (<font color='red'><b>chief</b></font>)</div>Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) towery helmet, black with shading plumes.

<p/>There, while her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) tears deplored the godlike man, Through all her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) train the soft infection ran; The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed, And mourn the living Hector, as the dead.
<p/>But now, no longer deaf to honour's call, Forth issues Paris from the palace wall. In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray, Swift through the town the warrior bends his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) way.
<p/>Breaks from his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) stall, and beats the trembling ground; Pamper'd and proud, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) seeks the wonted tides, And laves, in height of blood his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) shining sides; His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) head now freed, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) tosses to the skies; His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) mane dishevell'd o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) shoulders flies; He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) snuffs the females in the distant plain, And springs, exulting, to his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) fields again.
<p/>In arms refulgent as the god of day, The son of Priam, glorying in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might, Rush'd forth with Hector to the fields of fight.
<p/>The wanton courser thus with reins unbound-LRB-176-RRB- With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay, And now, the warriors passing on the way, The graceful Paris first excused his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stay.
<p/>To whom the noble Hector thus replied: <div class="bookquote">``O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied! Thy power in war with justice none contest

<p/>The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector, Minerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) descend from Olympus, joins her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) near the Scaean gate.
<p/>They agree to put off the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge the Greeks to a single combat.
<p/>Nine of the princes accepting the challenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after several attacks, are parted by the night.
<p/>The Trojans calling a council, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which Paris will not consent, but offers to restore them her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) riches.
<p/>Priam sends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning the dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon.
<p/>When the funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor, erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades.
<p/>Neptune testifies his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans with thunder, and other signs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) wrath.
<p/>The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax, the next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral rites of the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships.
<p/>So that somewhat about three days is employed in this book. The scene lies wholly in the field. So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state, Then rush'd impetuous through the Scaean gate.
<p/>As when to sailors labouring through the main, That long have heaved the weary oar in vain, Jove bids at length the expected gales arise; The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>sailors</b></font>) Paris follow'd to the dire alarms; Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms. So welcome these to Troy's desiring train, The bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again.
<p/>Bold Paris first the work of death begun On great Menestheus , Areithous' son, Sprung from the fair Philomeda's embrace, The pleasing Arne was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arne</b></font>) native place.
<p/>Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below, Beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Arne</b></font>) steely casque he (<font color='blue'><b>Arne</b></font>) felt the blow-LRB-177-RRB- Full on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arne</b></font>) neck, from Hector's weighty hand; And roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land.
<p/>By Glaucus' spear the bold Iphmous bleeds, Fix'd in the shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) mounts his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) steeds; Headlong he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) tumbles: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) slack nerves unbound,
<p/>Drop the cold useless members on the ground. When now Minerva saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) Argives slain, From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain
<p/>Fierce she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) descends: Apollo marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) flight, Nor shot less swift from Ilion's towery height. Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade; When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:
<p/>``What cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove! Thus wings thy progress from the realms above? Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way, To give to Greece the long divided day?
<p/>Too much has Troy already felt thy hate, Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate; This day, the business of the field suspend; War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend; Since vengeful goddesses confederate join To raze her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) walls, though built by hands divine.
<p/>To whom the progeny of Jove replies: ``I left, for this, the council of the skies: But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear, What art shall calm the furious sons of war?
<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the god: <div class="bookquote">``Great Hector's soul incite To dare the boldest Greek to single fight, Till Greece, provoked, from all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) numbers show A warrior worthy to be Hector's foe.

<p/>In form of vultures, on the beech's height They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight. The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields, Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.
<p/>The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps, And a still horror saddens all the deeps; Thus in thick orders settling wide around, At length composed they sit, and shade the ground.
<p/>Great Hector first amidst both armies broke The solemn silence, and their powers bespoke: <div class="bookquote">``Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands, What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.
<p/>Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose, O'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes; War with a fiercer tide once more returns, Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.
<p/>You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear; 'Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear: From all your troops select the boldest knight,
<p/>As when a general darkness veils the main, -LRB-Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat`ry plain,-RRB- And him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), the boldest, Hector dares to fight.

<p/>The breathless carcase to your navy sent, Greece on the shore shall raise a monument; Which when some future mariner surveys, Wash'd by broad Hellespont's resounding seas, Thus shall he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) say, 'A valiant Greek lies there,

<p/>But when old age had dimm'd Lycurgus' eyes, To Ereuthalion he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) consign'd the prize. Till I, the youngest of the host, appear'd, And, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.
<p/>I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown'd: Prone fell the giant o'er a length of ground. What then I was, O were your Nestor now!

<p/>With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly; The huge stone thundering through his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) buckler broke: His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke; Great Hector falls extended on the field, His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield: Nor wanted heavenly aid:
<p/>Spouts the black gore, and dims his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) shining shield. Apollo's might Confirm'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sinews, and restored to fight. And now both heroes their broad falchions drew
<p/>In flaming circles round their heads they flew; But then by heralds' voice the word was given. The sacred ministers of earth and heaven: Divine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ.

<p/>Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires, And I but move what every god requires: Let Sparta's treasures be this hour restored, And Argive Helen own her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) ancient lord.
<p/>Antenor, rising, thus demands their ear: <div class="bookquote">``Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear! ' The ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke, Our impious battles the just gods provoke.

<p/>Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore, Hew'd the green forests, and the bodies bore. In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.
<p/>Scarce could the friend his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) slaughter'd friend explore, With dust dishonour'd, and deformed with gore. The wounds they wash'd, their pious tears they shed, And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.

<p/>Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed, And decent on the pile dispose the dead; The cold remains consume with equal care; And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.
<p/>Now, ere the morn had streak'd with reddening light The doubtful confines of the day and night, About the dying flames
<p/>Sage Priam check'd their grief the Greeks appear'd, And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd. Then, to secure the camp and naval powers, They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:-LRB-186-RRB-

<p/>The rest they purchased at their proper cost, And well the plenteous freight supplied the host: Each, in exchange, proportion'd treasures gave;-LRB-188-RRB- Some, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave.
<p/>But Jove averse the signs of wrath display'd, And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade: Humbled they stood; pale horror seized on all, While the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.
<p/>All night they feast, the Greek and Trojan powers: Those on the fields, and these within their towers. Each pour'd to Jove before the bowl was
<p/>crown'd; And large libations drench'd the thirsty ground: Then late, refresh'd with sleep from toils of fight, Enjoy'd the balmy blessings of the night.
<p/>-LSB-Illustration: GREEK AMPHORA--WINE VESSELS.-RSB- GREEK AMPHORA--WINE VESSELS. BOOK VIII. ARGUMENT. THE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS. Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the pains of Tartarus if they assist either side:
<p/>Minerva only obtains of him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) may direct the Greeks by her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) counsels.-LRB-189-RRB- his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) balances the fates of both, and affrights the Greeks with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) thunders and lightnings.
<p/>Nestor alone continues in the field in great danger: Diomed relieves him (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>); whose exploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described.
<p/>Juno endeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and carried off.
<p/>Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are restrained by Iris, sent from Jupiter. The night puts an end to the battle.
<p/>Hector continues in the field, -LRB-the Greeks being driven to their fortifications before the ships,-RRB- and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the camp, to prevent the enemy from re-embarking and escaping by flight.
<p/>The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the poem to the end of this book.
<p/>They kindle fires through all the fields, and pass the night under arms. The scene here -LRB-except of the celestial machines-RRB- lies in the field towards the seashore.
<p/>Aurora now, fair daughter of the dawn, Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn; When Jove convened the senate of the skies,
<p/>Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise, The sire of gods his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) awful silence broke; The heavens attentive trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) spoke: ``Celestial states!
<p/>give ear, Hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear; The fix'd decree which not all heaven can move; Thou, fate!
<p/>What god but enters yon forbidden field, Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield, Back to the skies with shame he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) shall be driven, Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven; Or far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown, Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan, With burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors,
<p/>And lock'd by hell's inexorable doors; As deep beneath the infernal centre hurl'd,-LRB-190-RRB- As from that centre to the ethereal world. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) who tempts me, dread those dire abodes: And know, the Almighty is the god of gods.
<p/>immortal gods! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve! League all your forces, then, ye powers above, Join all, and try the omnipotence of Jove.
<p/>Whose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth, To drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth Ye strive in vain!
<p/>if I but stretch this hand, I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land; I fix the chain to great Olympus' height, And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!
<p/>Let down our golden everlasting chain-LRB-191-RRB- For such I reign, unbounded and above; And such are men, and gods, compared to Jove.
<p/>A reverend horror silenced all the sky; Trembling they stood before their sovereign's look; At length his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) best-beloved, the power of wisdom, spoke: <div class="bookquote">``O first and greatest!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>reverend</b></font>)</div>The all-mighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply: God, by gods adored We own thy might, our father and our lord!
<p/>From fields forbidden we submiss refrain, With arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain; Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move, Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove.
<p/>The cloud-compelling god her (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) suit approved, And smiled superior on his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) best beloved; Then call'd his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) coursers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) chariot took; The stedfast firmament beneath them shook:
<p/>But, ah! permit to pity human state: If not to help, at least lament their fate. '' Rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll'd
<p/>; Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold: Of heaven's undrossy gold the gods array, Refulgent, flash'd intolerable day.
<p/>But when to Ida's topmost height he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) came, -LRB-Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,-RRB- Where o'er her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) pointed summits proudly raised, His (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) fane breathed odours, and his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) altar blazed: There, from his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) radiant car, the sacred sire Of gods and men released the steeds of fire: Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced; High on the cloudy point his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) seat he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) placed; Thence his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) broad eye the subject world surveys, The town, and tents, and navigable seas.
<p/>High on the throne he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) shines: his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) coursers fly Between the extended earth and starry sky. Now had the Grecians snatch'd a short repast, And buckled on their shining arms with haste.
<p/>The gates unfolding pour forth all their train; Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain: Men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground, The tumult thickens, and the skies resound; And now with shouts the shocking armies closed, To lances lances, shields to shields opposed, Host against host with shadowy legends drew, The sounding darts in iron tempests flew; Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries, Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise; With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed, And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
<p/>Long as the morning beams, increasing bright, O'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light, Commutual death the fate of war confounds, Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.
<p/>Troy roused as soon; for on this dreadful day The fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay. But when the sun the height of heaven ascends, The sire of gods his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) golden scales suspends,-LRB-192-RRB-
<p/>With equal hand: in these explored the fate Of Greece and Troy, and poised the mighty weight: Press'd with its load, the Grecian balance lies Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.
<p/>Then Jove from Ida's top his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) horrors spreads; The clouds burst dreadful o'er the Grecian heads; Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls; Their strength he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) withers, and unmans their souls.
<p/>Before his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) wrath the trembling hosts retire; The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire. Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear, Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:
<p/>Nor he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>), the king of war, the alarm sustain'd Nestor alone, amidst the storm remain'd. Unwilling he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) remain'd, for Paris' dart
<p/>Had pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) courser in a mortal part; Fix'd in the forehead, where the springing man Curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the brain; Mad with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) anguish, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) begins to rear, Paw with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) hoofs aloft, and lash the air.
<p/>Scarce had his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) falchion cut the reins, and freed The encumber'd chariot from the dying steed, When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war, Pour'd to the tumult on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) whirling car.
<p/>That day had stretch'd beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) matchless hand The hoary monarch of the Pylian band, But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) rush'd, and on Ulysses call'd aloud : <div class="bookquote">``Whither, oh whither does Ulysses run? Oh, flight unworthy great Laertes' son! Mix'd
<p/>with the vulgar shall thy fate be found, Pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound? Oh turn and save from Hector's direful rage The glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage.
<p/>But bold Tydides to the rescue goes, A single warrior midst a host of foes; Before the coursers with a sudden spring
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) fruitless words are lost unheard in air, Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) leap'd, and anxious thus bespoke the king:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great perils, father! wait the unequal fight; These younger champions will oppress thy might. Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow, Weak is thy servant, and thy coursers slow.
<p/>Then haste, ascend my seat, and from the car Observe the steeds of Tros, renown'd in war. Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase, To dare the fight, or urge the rapid race:
<p/>These late obey'd Ćneas' guiding rein; Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train; With these against yon Trojans will we go, Nor shall great Hector want an equal foe;
<p/>Fierce as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) is, even he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) may learn to fear The thirsty fury of my flying spear. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>Thus said the chief; and Nestor, skill'd in war, Approves his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) counsel, and ascends the car:
<p/>The steeds he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) left, their trusty servants hold; Eurymedon, and Sthenelus the bold: The reverend charioteer directs the course, And strains his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) aged arm to lash the horse.
<p/>Hector they face; unknowing how to fear, Fierce he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) drove on; Tydides whirl'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) spear. The spear with erring haste mistook its way, But plunged in Eniopeus' bosom lay.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) opening hand in death forsakes the rein; The steeds fly back: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) falls, and spurns the plain. Great Hector sorrows for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) servant kill'd,
<p/>Yet unrevenged permits to press the field; Till, to supply his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) place and rule the car, Rose Archeptolemus, the fierce in war.
<p/>And now had death and horror cover'd all;-LRB-193-RRB- Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall Inclosed had bled: but Jove with awful sound Roll'd the big thunder o'er the vast profound:
<p/>Full in Tydides' face the lightning flew; The ground before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) flamed with sulphur blue; The quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;
<p/>And Nestor's trembling hand confess'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) fright : He (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) dropp'd the reins: and, shook with sacred dread, Thus, turning, warn'd the intrepid Diomed:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O chief! too daring in thy friend's defence Retire advised, and urge the chariot hence. This day, averse, the sovereign of the skies Assists great Hector, and our palm denies.
<p/>Some other sun may see the happier hour, When Greece shall conquer by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) heavenly power. ' Tis not in man his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fix'd decree to move:

<p/>But ah, what grief! should haughty Hector boast I fled inglorious to the guarded coast. Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame, O'erwhelm me, earth; and hide a warrior's shame!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gerenian Nestor</b></font>)</div><p/>To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:-LRB-194-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Gods! can thy courage fear the Phrygian's pride? Hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?
<p/>Not those who felt thy arm, the Dardan host, Nor Troy, yet bleeding in her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) heroes lost; Not even a Phrygian dame, who dreads the sword That laid in dust her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) loved, lamented lord.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) said, and, hasty, o'er the gasping throng Drives the swift steeds: the chariot smokes along; The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind; The storm of hissing javelins pours behind.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Gerenian Nestor</b></font>)</div>Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies, Pleased, Hector braves the warrior as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) flies. '' Go, mighty hero!
<p/>In seats of council and the sumptuous feast: Now hope no more those honours from thy train; Go less than woman, in the form of man!
<p/>To scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames, To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames, Thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled; This arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead.
<p/>graced above the rest '' Now fears dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>), and now hopes invite. To stop his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) coursers, and to stand the fight;
<p/>Thrice turn'd the chief, and thrice imperial Jove On Ida's summits thunder'd from above. Great Hector heard; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) saw the flashing light,
<p/>-LRB-The sign of conquest,-RRB- and thus urged the fight: ``Hear, every Trojan, Lycian, Dardan band, All famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.
<p/>Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won, Your great forefathers' glories, and your own. Heard ye the voice of Jove?
<p/>Success and fame Await on Troy, on Greece eternal shame. In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall, Weak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.
<p/>Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand, Fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand; Till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires, All Greece, encompass'd, in one blaze expires.
<p/>Furious he (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) said; then bending o'er the yoke, Encouraged his (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) proud steeds, while thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) spoke: <div class="bookquote">``Now, Xanthus, Ćthon, Lampus, urge the chase, And thou, Podargus!

<p/>Swift as he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) moved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) lifted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) hand His (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) purple robe, bright ensign of command. High on the midmost bark the king
<p/>appear'd: There, from Ulysses' deck, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) voice was heard: To Ajax and Achilles reach'd the sound, Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.
<p/>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) cried: The hollow vessels to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) voice replied,-RRB- Where now are all your glorious boasts of yore, Your hasty triumphs on the Lemnian shore?
<p/>Each fearless hero dares a hundred foes, While the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows; But who to meet one martial man is found, When the fight rages, and the flames surround?
<p/>'' O Argives! shame of human race! O mighty Jove! O sire of the distress'd! Was ever king like me, like me oppress'd?
<p/>With power immense, with justice arm'd in vain; My glory ravish'd, and my people slain! To thee my vows were breathed from every shore;
<p/>What altar smoked not with our victims' gore? With fat of bulls I fed the constant flame, And ask'd destruction to the Trojan name.
<p/>Now, gracious god! far humbler our demand; Give these at least to `scape from Hector's hand, And save the relics of the Grecian land!''
<p/>Thus pray'd the king, and heaven's great father heard His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) vows, in bitterness of soul preferr'd: The wrath appeased, by happy signs declares, And gives the people to their monarch's prayers.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) sent, A fawn his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) talons truss'd, -LRB-divine portent!-RRB- High o'er the wondering hosts he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) soar'd above
<p/>, Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove; Then let the prey before his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) altar fall; The Greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:
<p/>Tydides first, of all the Grecian force, O'er the broad ditch impell'd his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) foaming horse, Pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore, And dyed his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) javelin red with Trojan gore.
<p/>Encouraged by the sign, the troops revive, And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive. Young Agelaus -LRB-Phradmon was his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) sire-RRB-
<p/>With flying coursers shunn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) dreadful ire; Struck through the back, the Phrygian fell oppress'd; The dart drove on, and issued at his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) breast: Headlong he (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) quits the car: his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) arms resound; His (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.
<p/>Forth rush a tide of Greeks, the passage freed; The Atridae first, the Ajaces next succeed: Meriones, like Mars in arms renown'd, And godlike Idomen, now passed the mound; Evaemon's son next issues to the foe, And last young Teucer with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bended bow.
<p/>Secure behind the Telamonian shield The skilful archer wide survey'd the field , With every shaft some hostile victim slew, Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:
<p/>The conscious infant so, when fear alarms, Retires for safety to the mother's arms. Thus Ajax guards his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) brother in the field,
<p/>Moves as he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) moves, and turns the shining shield. Who first by Teucer's mortal arrows bled? Orsilochus; then fell Ormenus dead:
<p/>The godlike Lycophon next press'd the plain, With Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes slain: Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground; The bloody pile great Melanippus crown'd.
<p/>Heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) art, A Trojan ghost attending every dart. Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye

Hector with grief his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) charioteer beheld All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:
<p/>Then bids Cebriones direct the rein, Quits his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) bright car, and issues on the plain. Dreadful he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) shouts: from earth a stone he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) took, And rush'd on Teucer with the lifted rock.
<p/>the forceful yew; The shaft already to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) shoulder drew; The feather in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) hand, just wing'd for flight, Touch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite; There, where the juncture knits the channel bone, The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fell: but Ajax his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) broad shield display'd, And screen'd his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) brother with the mighty shade; Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore The batter'd archer groaning to the shore.
<p/>The youth already strain'd The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow, And his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) numb'd hand dismiss'd his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) useless bow. Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) arm'd their hands, and fill'd their breasts with fire. The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall, Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.
<p/>First of the foe, great Hector march'd along, With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong. As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase, With beating bosom, and with eager pace,
<p/>Hangs on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) haunch, or fastens on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) heels, Guards as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) turns, and circles as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) wheels; Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;
<p/>Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew. When flying they had pass'd the trench profound, And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;
<p/>Before the ships a desperate stand they made, And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid. Fierce on his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) rattling chariot Hector came: His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame
<p/>That wither'd all their host: like Mars he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stood: Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god! Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey'd;
<p/>Then pensive thus, to war's triumphant maid: ``O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield The avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!

<p/>Averse to me of all his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) heaven of gods, At Thetis' suit the partial Thunderer nods; To grace her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) gloomy, fierce, resenting son, My hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.
<p/>Some future day, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) may be moved To call his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) blue-eyed maid his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) best beloved.

<p/>-LSB-Illustration: THE SHIELD OF ACHILLES.-RSB- THE SHIELD OF ACHILLES. BOOK IX. ARGUMENT. THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES. Agamemnon, after the last day's defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit the siege, and return to their country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) orders the guard to be strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are to be followed in this emergency.
<p/>Agamemnon pursues this advice, and Nestor further prevails upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) to send ambassadors to Achilles, in order to move him (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) to a reconciliation.
<p/>Diomed opposes this, and Nestor seconds him (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>), praising his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) wisdom and resolution. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice of, who are accompanied by old Phoenix.
<p/>They make, each of them, very moving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by Achilles, who notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) tent.
<p/>This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night, which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem.
<p/>The ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake themselves to sleep. The scene lies on the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.
<p/>Thus joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night; While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,-LRB-199-RRB- And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part, Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.
<p/>As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth, A double tempest of the west and north Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore, Heaps waves on waves, and bids the Ćgean roar:
<p/>This way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd: Such various passions urged the troubled host, Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;
<p/>; Himself his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) orders to the heralds bears, To bid to council all the Grecian peers, But bid in whispers: these surround their chief, In solemn sadness and majestic grief.
<p/>Superior sorrows swell'd his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) royal breast The king amidst the mournful circle rose: Down his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) wan cheek a briny torrent flows.
<p/>With more than vulgar grief he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) stood oppress'd; Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) breast: ``Ye sons of Greece!
<p/>So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head, In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed. partake your leader's care; Fellows in arms and princes of the war!
<p/>Of partial Jove too justly we complain, And heavenly oracles believed in vain. A safe return was promised to our toils, With conquest honour'd and
<p/>enrich'd with spoils: Now shameful flight alone can save the host; Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost. So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!
<p/>Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall, Who shakes the feeble props of human trust, And towers and armies humbles to the dust.
<p/>Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields, Haste to the joys our native country yields; Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ, Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.
<p/>till Tydeus' warlike son Roll'd on the king his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) eyes, and thus begun: <div class="bookquote">``When kings advise us to renounce our fame, First let him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) speak who first has suffer'd shame.

<p/>thy wrath withhold, The laws of council bid my tongue be bold. Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight, Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:
<p/>Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear'd, The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard. The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring, The gods have made thee but
<p/>by halves a king : They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command; They gave dominion o'er the seas and land;
<p/>The noblest power that might the world control They gave thee not--a brave and virtuous soul. Is this a general's voice, that would suggest Fears like his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) own to every Grecian breast?
<p/>from the embattled plain; Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main; A noble care the Grecians shall employ, To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.
<p/>Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire, Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire; Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame; God bade us fight, and 'twas with God we came.
<p/>Confiding in our want of worth, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stands; And if we fly, 'tis what our king commands. Go thou, inglorious! ''

Wise Nestor then his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) reverend figure These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves, Applauding Greece with common voice approves.
<p/>Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth: And blame even kings with praise, because with truth. And yet those years that since thy birth have run Would hardly style thee Nestor's youngest son.

<p/>This night, refresh and fortify thy train; Between the trench and wall let guards remain: Be that the duty of the young and bold;
<p/>But thou, O king, to council call the old; Great is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares; Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.
<p/>With Thracian wines recruit thy honour'd guests, For happy counsels flow from sober feasts. Wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress'd, And such a monarch as can choose the best.
<p/>See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires, How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires! Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?
<p/>What eye beholds them, and can close to-night? This dreadful interval determines all; To-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>Thus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey; Swift through the gates the guards direct their way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) son was first to pass the lofty mound, The generous Thrasymed, in arms renown'd:
<p/>Next him (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>), Ascalaphus, Ialmen, stood, The double offspring of the warrior-god: Deipyrus, Aphareus, Merion join, And Lycomed of Creon's noble line.
<p/>Seven were the leaders of the nightly bands, And each bold chief a hundred spears commands. The fires they light, to short repasts they fall, Some line the trench, and others man the wall.
<p/>The king of men, on public counsels bent, Convened the princes in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ample tent, Each seized a portion of the kingly feast, But stay'd his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hand when thirst and hunger ceased.
<p/>whose superior sway Assembled states, and lords of earth obey, The laws and sceptres to thy hand are given, And millions own the care of thee and Heaven.
<p/>Then Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved, And slowly rising, thus the council moved. '' Monarch of nations! O king! the counsels of my age attend; With thee my cares begin, with thee must end.
<p/>it fits alike to speak and hear, Pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear, To see no wholesome motion be withstood, And ratify the best for public good.
<p/>Thee, prince! Nor, though a meaner give advice, repine, But follow it, and make the wisdom thine. Hear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,

<p/>The Myrmidonian tents and vessels lay; Amused at ease, the godlike man they found, Pleased with the solemn harp's harmonious sound.
<p/>And now, arrived, where on the sandy bay -LRB-The well wrought harp from conquered Thebae came; Of polish'd silver was its costly frame.-RRB-
<p/>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soothes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) angry soul, and sings The immortal deeds of heroes and of kings. Patroclus only of the royal train, Placed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tent, attends the lofty strain:
<p/>Full opposite he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat, and listen'd long, In silence waiting till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ceased the song. Unseen the Grecian embassy proceeds To his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) high tent; the great Ulysses leads.
<p/>Achilles starting, as the chiefs he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) spied, Leap'd from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) seat, and laid the harp aside. With like surprise arose Menoetius' son: Pelides grasp'd their hands, and thus begun:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Princes, all hail! whatever brought you here. Or strong necessity, or urgent fear; Welcome, though Greeks! for not as foes ye came; To me more dear than all that bear the name.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Menoetius son</b></font>)</div>With that, the chiefs beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) roof he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) led, And placed in seats with purple carpets spread. Then thus--<div class="bookquote">``Patroclus, crown a larger bowl, Mix purer wine, and open every soul.
<p/>Of all the warriors yonder host can send, Thy friend most honours these, and these thy friend. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said: Patroclus o'er the blazing fire Heaps in a brazen vase
<p/>three chines entire: The brazen vase Automedon sustains, Which flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains. Achilles at the genial feast presides, The parts transfixes, and with skill divides.
<p/>Then, when the languid flames at length subside, He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) strows a bed of glowing embers wide, Above the coals the smoking fragments turns And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns; With bread the glittering canisters they load, Which round the board Menoetius' son bestow'd; Himself, opposed to Ulysses full in sight, Each portion parts, and orders every rite.
<p/>The first fat offering to the immortals due, Amidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw; Then each, indulging in the social feast, His (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) thirst and hunger soberly repress'd. That done, to Phoenix Ajax gave the sign: Not unperceived; Ulysses crown'd with wine The foaming bowl, and instant thus began, His (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) speech addressing to the godlike man.
<p/>Meanwhile Patroclus sweats, the fire to raise; The tent is brighten'd with the rising blaze: '' Health to Achilles! happy are thy guests!
<p/>Not those more honour'd whom Atrides feasts: Though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards, That, Agamemnon's regal tent affords; But greater cares sit heavy on our souls, Nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.
<p/>The dead we mourn, and for the living fear; Greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands, And owns no help
<p/>: Troy and her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aids for ready vengeance call; Their threatening tents already shade our wall: Hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim, And point at every ship their vengeful flame!
<p/>What scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear! but from thy saving hands For them the father of the gods declares, Theirs are his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) omens, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thunder theirs.
<p/>See, full of Jove, avenging Hector rise! See! heaven and earth the raging chief defies; What fury in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) breast, what lightning in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) eyes!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) waits but for the morn, to sink in flame The ships, the Greeks, and all the Grecian name. Heavens! how my country's woes distract my mind, Lest Fate accomplish all his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) rage design'd!
<p/>: oh return, though late, To save thy Greeks, and stop the course of Fate; If in that heart or grief or courage lies, Rise to redeem; ah, yet to conquer, rise!
<p/>And must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay In Trojan dust, and this the fatal day? Return, Achilles The day may come, when, all our warriors slain, That heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain:
<p/>When Peleus in his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) aged arms embraced His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) parting son, these accents were his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) last: ''`My child! with strength, with glory, and success, Thy arms may Juno and Minerva bless!
<p/>Regard in time, O prince divinely brave! Those wholesome counsels which thy father gave. Trust that to Heaven: but thou, thy cares engage To calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage:
<p/>From gentler manners let thy glory grow, And shun contention, the sure source of woe; That young and old may in thy praise combine, The virtues of humanity be thine--' This now-despised advice thy father gave; Ah! check thy anger; and be truly brave.
<p/>If thou wilt yield to great Atrides' prayers, Gifts worthy thee his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) royal hand prepares; If not--but hear me, while I number o'er
<p/>The proffer'd presents, an exhaustless store. Ten weighty talents of the purest gold, And twice ten vases of refulgent mould; Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame
<p/>; Twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force, And still victorious in the dusty course; -LRB-Rich were the man, whose ample stores exceed The prizes purchased by their winged speed;-RRB- Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line, Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd
<p/>Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame in form divine, The same he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) chose for more than vulgar charms, When Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms.
<p/>All these, to buy thy friendship shall be paid, And, join'd with these, the long-contested maid; With all her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) charms, Briseis he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>)'ll resign, And solemn swear those charms were only thine;
<p/>Untouch'd she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) stay'd, uninjured she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) removes, Pure from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) arms, and guiltless of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) loves. These instant shall be thine; and
<p/>if the powers Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers, Then shalt thou store -LRB-when Greece the spoil divides-RRB- With gold and brass thy loaded navy's sides.
<p/>Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race With copious love shall crown thy warm embrace; Such as thyself shall chose; who yield to none, Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.
<p/>Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er, If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore, There shalt thou live his (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) son, his (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) honour share,
<p/>And with Orestes' self divide his (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) care. Yet more--three daughters in his (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) court are bred, And each well worthy of a royal bed:
<p/>whom most thy eyes approve; He (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) asks no presents, no reward for love: Himself will give the dower; so vast a store
<p/>Laodice and Iphigenia fair, And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair: Her (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) shalt thou wed As never father gave a child before.
<p/>Seven ample cities shall confess thy sway, The Enope and Pherae thee obey, Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd, And sacred Pedasus, for vines renown'd:
<p/>Ćpea fair, the pastures Hira yields, And rich Antheia with her (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) flowery fields; The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain, Along the verdant margin of the main.
<p/>There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil; Bold are the men, and generous is the soil. There shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown'd, And rule the tributary realms around.
<p/>But if all this, relentless, thou disdain, If honour and if interest plead in vain, Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford, And be, amongst her (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) guardian gods, adored.
<p/>Such are the proffers which this day we bring, Such the repentance of a suppliant king. If no regard thy suffering country claim, Hear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:
<p/>For now that chief, whose unresisted ire Made nations tremble, and whole hosts retire, Proud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands, And only triumphs to deserve thy hands.
<p/>'' Then thus the goddess-born: <div class="bookquote">``Ulysses, hear A faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear; What in my secret soul is understood, My tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.
<p/>Let Greece then know, my purpose I retain: Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain. Who dares think one thing, and another tell, My heart detests him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) as the gates of hell.
<p/>Then thus in short my fix'd resolves attend, Which nor Atrides nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) Greeks can bend; Long toils, long perils in their cause I bore,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But now the unfruitful glories charm no more. Fight or not fight, a like reward we claim, The wretch and hero find their prize the same.
<p/>Alike regretted in the dust he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) lies, Who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies. Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains, A life of labours, lo!
<p/>As the bold bird her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) helpless young attends, From danger guards them, and from want defends; In search of prey she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wings the spacious air,
<p/>For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved, Her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wives, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) infants, by my labours saved; Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood, And sweat laborious days in dust and blood.
<p/>And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain: Then at Atrides' haughty feet were laid The wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.
<p/>what fruit remains? And with the untasted food supplies her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) care: I sack'd twelve ample cities on the main,-LRB-207-RRB- Your mighty monarch these in peace possess'd; Some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.
<p/>Some present, too, to every prince was paid; And every prince enjoys the gift he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) made: I only must refund, of all his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) train; See what pre-eminence our merits gain!
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) greedy soul delights: My spouse alone must bless his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) lustful nights: The woman, let him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) may-RRB- enjoy; But what's the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?
<p/>My spoil alone What to these shores the assembled nations draws, What calls for vengeance but a woman's cause? Are fair endowments and a beauteous face
<p/>Beloved by none but those of Atreus' race? The wife whom choice and passion doth approve, Sure every wise and worthy man will love.
<p/>Nor did my fair one less distinction claim; Slave as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was, my soul adored the dame. Wrong'd in my love, all proffers I disdain; Deceived for once, I trust not kings again.
<p/>Ye have my answer--what remains to do, Your king, Ulysses, may consult with you. What needs he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) the defence this arm can make?
<p/>Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) not walls no human force can shake? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) not fenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) guarded navy round With piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?
<p/>And will not these -LRB-the wonders he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) has done-RRB- Repel the rage of Priam's single son? There was a time -LRB-'twas when for Greece I fought-RRB-
<p/>When Hector's prowess no such wonders wrought; He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait Achilles' fury at the Scaean gate; He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.
<p/>But now those ancient enmities are o'er ; To-morrow we the favouring gods implore; Then shall you see our parting vessels crown'd, And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.
<p/>The third day hence shall Pthia greet our sails,-LRB-208-RRB- If mighty Neptune send propitious gales; Pthia to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) Achilles shall restore The wealth he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) left for this detested shore:
<p/>The ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass: My beauteous captives thither I'll convey, And all that rests of my unravish'd prey.
<p/>Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass, One only valued gift your tyrant gave, And that resumed--the fair Lyrnessian slave.
<p/>Then tell him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>): loud, that all the Greeks may hear, And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear; -LRB-For arm'd in impudence, mankind he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) braves, And meditates new cheats on all his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) slaves; Though shameless as he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is, to face these eyes Is what he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) dares not: if he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) dares he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) dies;-RRB- Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), all terms, all commerce I decline, Nor share his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) council, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) battle join; For once deceiv'd, was his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>); but twice were mine,
<p/>; His (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind Stand but as slaves before a noble mind, Not though he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) proffer'd all himself
<p/>possess'd, And all his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) rapine could from others wrest: Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown The many-peopled Orchomenian town;-LRB-209-RRB-
<p/>Thebes' unrivall'd walls contain, The world's great empress on the Egyptian plain -LRB-That spreads her (<font color='blue'><b>empress</b></font>) conquests o'er a thousand states, And pours her (<font color='blue'><b>empress</b></font>) heroes through a hundred gates, Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars From each wide portal issuing to the wars-RRB-;-LRB-210-RRB-
<p/>Though bribes were heap'd on bribes, in number more Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore; Should all these offers for my friendship call, 'Tis he (<font color='blue'><b>empress</b></font>) that offers, and I scorn them all.
<p/>Atrides' daughter never shall be led -LRB-An ill-match'd consort-RRB- to Achilles' bed; Like golden Venus though she (<font color='blue'><b>Venus</b></font>) charm'd the heart, And vied with Pallas in the works of art; Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace, I hate alliance with a tyrant's race.
<p/>If heaven restore me to my realms with life, The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife; Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine, And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.
<p/>Bless'd in kind love, my years shall glide away, Content with just hereditary sway; There, deaf for ever to the martial strife, Enjoy the dear prerogative of life.
<p/>No--let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives Of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives Not all proud Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold.
<p/>Not all Apollo's Pythian treasures hold, Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway, Can bribe the poor possession of a day!
<p/>Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain, And steeds unrivall'd on the dusty plain: But from our lips the vital spirit fled, Returns no more to wake the silent dead.
<p/>My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed, And each alternate, life or fame, proposed; Here, if I stay, before the Trojan town, Short is my date, but deathless my renown: If I return, I quit immortal praise For years on years, and long-extended days.
<p/>Convinced, though late, I find my fond mistake, And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make; To quit these shores, their native seats enjoy, Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.
<p/>Go then to Greece, report our fix'd design; Bid all your counsels, all your armies join, Let all your forces, all your arts conspire, To save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.
<p/>Jove's arm display'd asserts her (<font color='blue'><b>troops</b></font>) from the skies! Her (<font color='blue'><b>troops</b></font>) hearts are strengthen'd, and her (<font color='blue'><b>troops</b></font>) glories rise. One stratagem has fail'd, and others will: Ye find, Achilles is unconquer'd still.
<p/>Go then--digest my message as ye may-- But here this night let reverend Phoenix stay: His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) tedious toils and hoary hairs demand A peaceful death in Pthia's friendly land.
<p/>But whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) remain or sail with me, His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) age be sacred, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) will be free.'' -LSB-Illustration: GREEK GALLEY.-RSB- GREEK GALLEY.
<p/>The son of Peleus ceased: the chiefs around In silence wrapt, in consternation drown'd, Attend the stern reply. Then Phoenix rose; -LRB-Down his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) white beard a stream of sorrow flows;-RRB-
<p/>And while the fate of suffering Greece he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mourn'd, With accent weak these tender words return'd. -LSB-Illustration: PROSERPINE.-RSB- PROSERPINE. '' Divine Achilles!
<p/>wilt thou then retire, And leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire? If wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sent thee early to the Achaian host; Thy youth as then in sage debates unskill'd, And new to perils of the direful field: He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) bade me teach thee all the ways of war, To shine in councils, and in camps to dare.
<p/>, How shall thy friend, thy Phoenix, stay behind? The royal Peleus, when from Pthia's coast Never, ah, never let me leave thy side!
<p/>No time shall part us, and no fate divide, Not though the god, that breathed my life, restore The bloom I boasted, and the port I bore, When Greece of old beheld my youthful flames -LRB-Delightful Greece, the land of lovely dames-RRB-, My father faithless to my mother's arms, Old as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, adored a stranger's charms.
<p/>I tried what youth could do -LRB-at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) desire-RRB- To win the damsel, and prevent my sire. My sire with curses loads my hated head, And cries, `Ye furies!
<p/>barren be his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) bed.' Infernal Jove, the vengeful fiends below, And ruthless Proserpine, confirm'd his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) vow. Despair and grief distract my labouring mind!
<p/>To plunge the poniard in my father's breast; Then meditate my flight: my friends in vain With prayers entreat me, and with force detain.
<p/>On fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine, They daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine; Strong guards they placed, and watch'd nine nights entire; The roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.
<p/>Gods! what a crime my impious heart design'd! I thought -LRB-but some kind god that thought suppress'd-RRB- The tenth, I forced the gates, unseen of all: And,
<p/>favour'd by the night, o'erleap'd the wall, My travels thence through spacious Greece extend; In Phthia's court at last my labours end.
<p/>Your sire received me, as his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) son caress'd, With gifts enrich'd, and with possessions bless'd. The strong Dolopians thenceforth own'd my reign, And all the coast that runs along the main.
<p/>By love to thee his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) bounties I repaid, And early wisdom to thy soul convey'd : Great as thou art, my lessons made thee brave:
<p/>A child I took thee, but a hero gave. Thy infant breast a like affection show'd; Still in my arms -LRB-an ever-pleasing load-RRB-
<p/>I pass my watchings o'er thy helpless years, The tender labours, the compliant cares, The gods -LRB-I thought-RRB- reversed their hard decree, And Phoenix felt a father's joys in thee
<p/>Or at my knee, by Phoenix wouldst thou stand ; No food was grateful but from Phoenix' hand.-LRB-211-RRB- : Thy growing virtues justified my cares, And promised comfort to my silver hairs.
<p/>The gods -LRB-the only great, and only wise-RRB- Are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice; Offending man their high compassion wins, And daily prayers atone for daily sins.
<p/>Prayers are Jove's daughters, of celestial race, Lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face; With humble mien, and with dejected eyes, Constant they follow, where injustice flies.
<p/>Injustice swift, erect, and unconfined, Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind, While Prayers, to heal her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrongs, move slow behind.
<p/>Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove, For him (<font color='blue'><b>almighty</b></font>) they mediate to the throne above When man rejects the humble suit they make, The sire revenges for the daughters' sake;
<p/>Now be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign'd; A cruel heart ill suits a manly mind: From Jove commission'd, fierce injustice then Descends to punish unrelenting men.
<p/>O let not headlong passion bear the sway These reconciling goddesses obey Due honours to the seed of Jove belong, Due honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.
<p/>Were these not paid thee by the terms we bring, Were rage still harbour'd in the haughty king; Nor Greece nor all her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) fortunes should engage Thy friend to plead against so just a rage.
<p/>But since what honour asks the general sends, And sends by those whom most thy heart commends; The best and noblest of the Grecian train; Permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!
<p/>Let me -LRB-my son-RRB- an ancient fact unfold, A great example drawn from times of old; Hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,
<p/>Once fought the Ćtolian and Curetian bands; To guard it those; to conquer, these advance; And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.
<p/>Who conquer'd their revenge in former days. '' Where Calydon on rocky mountains stands-LRB-212-RRB- The silver Cynthia bade contention rise, In vengeance of neglected sacrifice; On OEneus fields she (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) sent a monstrous boar, That levell'd harvests, and whole forests tore:
<p/>This beast -LRB-when many a chief his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) tusks had slain-RRB- Great Meleager stretch'd along the plain, Then, for his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) spoils, a new debate arose, The neighbour nations thence commencing foes.

<p/>-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Cynthia</b></font>) from Marpessa sprung, divinely fair, And matchless Idas, more than man in war: The god of day adored the mother's charms; Against the god the father bent his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms: The afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim, From Cleopatra changed their daughter's name, And

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the chief retired from stern debate, But found no peace from fierce Althaea's hate: Althaea's hate the unhappy warrior drew,
<p/>Whose luckless hand his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) royal uncle slew; She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beat the ground, and call'd the powers beneath On her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own son to wreak her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother's death; Hell heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) curses from the realms profound, And the red fiends that walk the nightly round.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sent ambassadors, a chosen band, Priests of the gods, and elders of the land; Besought the chief to save the sinking state: Their prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:
<p/>In vain Ćtolia her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deliverer waits, War shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walls, and thunders at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gates. -LRB-Full fifty acres of the richest ground,

<p/>Meanwhile the victor's shouts ascend the skies; The walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise; At length his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) wife -LRB-a form divine-RRB- appears, With piercing cries, and supplicating tears; She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) paints the horrors of a conquer'd town, The heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown, The matrons ravish'd
<p/>Half pasture green, and half with vineyards crown'd:-RRB- His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) suppliant father, aged OEneus, came; , the whole race enslaved: The warrior heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) vanquish'd, and he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) saved.
<p/>Learn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire, Nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire; Accept the presents; draw thy conquering sword; And be amongst our guardian gods adored.
<p/>The Ćtolians, long disdain'd, now took their turn, And left the chief their broken faith to mourn. ''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>): the stern Achilles thus replied:

<p/>Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner.

<p/>'' -LSB-Illustration: ACHILLES.-RSB- ACHILLES. BOOK X. ARGUMENT. THE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, and Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains.
<p/>They call a council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies' camp, to learn their posture, and discover their intentions.
<p/>Diomed undertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians.
<p/>From him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) they are informed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and particularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were lately arrived.
<p/>They pass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) officers, and seize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in triumph to the camp.
<p/>All night the chiefs before their vessels lay, And lost in sleep the labours of the day: All but the king: with various thoughts oppress'd,-LRB-215-RRB-
<p/>As when by lightnings Jove's ethereal power Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower, Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore, Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar; By fits one flash succeeds as one expires, And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:
<p/>The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps. His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) country's cares lay rolling in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) breast. So bursting frequent from Atrides' breast, Sighs following sighs his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) inward fears confess'd.
<p/>Now o'er the fields, dejected, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) surveys From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze; Hears in the passing wind their music blow, And marks distinct the voices of the foe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) rends his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) hair, in sacrifice to Jove, And sues to him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) that ever lives above: Inly he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) groans; while glory and despair Divide his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) heart, and wage a double war.
<p/>A thousand cares his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) labouring breast revolves; To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves, With him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), in wholesome counsels, to debate What yet remains to save the afflicted state.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) rose, and first he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) cast his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) mantle round, Next on his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) feet the shining sandals bound; A lion's yellow spoils
<p/>Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast, Anxious he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) sorrows for the endangered host. his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) back conceal'd; His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) warlike hand a pointed javelin held.
<p/>Alike denied the gifts of soft repose, Laments for Greece, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) cause before So much had suffer'd and must suffer more.
<p/>: A brazen helmet glitter'd on his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) head: Thus -LRB-with a javelin in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) hand-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) went To wake Atrides in the royal tent.
<p/>Meanwhile his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) brother, press'd with equal woes, A leopard's spotted hide his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) shoulders spread Already waked, Atrides he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) descried, His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) armour buckling at his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) vessel's side.
<p/>Joyful they met; the Spartan thus begun: ``Why puts my brother his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) bright armour on? Sends he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) some spy, amidst these silent hours, To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?
<p/>But say, what hero shall sustain that task? Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask; Guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go, And midst a hostile camp explore the foe.
<p/>To whom the king: <div class="bookquote">``In such distress we stand, No vulgar counsel our affairs demand; Greece to preserve, is now no easy part, But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.

<p/>Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet, There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete; Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair; To keep the guards on duty be his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) care, -LRB-For Nestor's influence best that quarter guides, Whose son with Merion

<p/>Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise, Urge by their fathers' fame their future praise. Forget we now our state and lofty birth; Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.
<p/>To labour is the lot of man below; And when Jove gave us life, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave us woe. '' This said, each parted to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) several cares:
<p/>The king to Nestor's sable ship repairs; The sage protector of the Greeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) found Stretch'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) bed with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) arms around The various-colour'd scarf, the shield he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) rears, The shining helmet, and the pointed spears; The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage, That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.
<p/>Then, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) hand his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) watchful head, The hoary monarch raised his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) eyes and said: <div class="bookquote">``What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown, While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;
<p/>Seek`st thou some friend or nightly sentinel? Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The monarch</b></font>)</div>'' O son of Neleus, -LRB-thus the king rejoin'd,-RRB-
<p/>Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands, The unhappy general of the Grecian bands, Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend, And woes, that only with his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) life shall end!
<p/>Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind! Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain, And scarce my heart support its load of pain.
<p/>No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known, Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone, With fears distracted, with no fix'd design; And all my people's miseries are mine.
<p/>If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest, -LRB-Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,-RRB- Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend; Now let us jointly to the trench descend,
<p/>Tired with the toils of day and watch of night; Else may the sudden foe our works invade, So near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade.
<p/>At every gate the fainting guard excite, '' To him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) thus Nestor: ``Trust the powers above, Nor think proud Hector's hopes confirm'd by Jove:
<p/>Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain That great Achilles rise and rage again, What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!
<p/>How ill agree the views of vain mankind, And the wise counsels of the eternal mind! Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys
<p/>; The care is next our other chiefs to raise: Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need; Meges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.
<p/>Some other be despatch'd of nimbler feet, To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet, Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.-LRB-216-RRB-
<p/>I myself decree; Dear as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is to us, and dear to thee, Yet must I tax his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sloth, that claims no share With his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) great brother in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) martial care:
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) it behoved to every chief to sue, Preventing every part perform'd by you; For strong necessity our toils demands, Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands.
<p/>To whom the king: <div class="bookquote">``With reverence we allow Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now: My generous brother is of gentle kind, He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind; Through too much deference to our sovereign sway, Content to follow when we lead the way: But now, our ills industrious to prevent, Long ere the rest he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) rose, and sought my tent.

<p/>Without his (<font color='blue'><b>Wise</b></font>) tent, bold Diomed they found, All sheathed in arms, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wise</b></font>) brave companions round: Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field, His (<font color='blue'><b>Wise</b></font>) head reclining on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wise</b></font>) bossy shield.
<p/>A wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright, Shot from their flashing points a quivering light. A bull's black hide composed the hero's bed;
<p/>A splendid carpet roll'd beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) head. Then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) foot, old Nestor gently shakes The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes: ``Rise, son of Tydeus!
<p/>to the brave and strong Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long. But sleep`st thou now, when from yon hill the foe Hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?
<p/>At this, soft slumber from his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) eyelids fled; The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows, Though years and honours bid thee seek repose, Let younger Greeks

<p/>This said, the hero o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) shoulders flung A lion's spoils, that to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) ankles hung; Then seized his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) ponderous lance, and strode along.

<p/>With toil protected from the prowling train; When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold, Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold: Through breaking woods her (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) rustling course they hear; Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,

<p/>Contending leaders at the word arose; Each generous breast with emulation glows; So brave a task each Ajax strove to share, Bold Merion strove, and Nestor's valiant heir; The Spartan wish'd the second place to gain, And great Ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.

<p/>So distant they, and such the space between, As when two teams of mules divide the green, -LRB-To whom the hind like shares of land allows,-RRB-
<p/>Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd; Hector -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) thought-RRB- had sent, and check'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) haste, Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw, No voice succeeding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) perceived the foe.

<p/>Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance, And snatch the glory from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) lifted lance. Then thus aloud: <div class="bookquote">``Whoe'er thou art, remain; This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.

<p/>A radiant baldric, o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) shoulder tied, Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) side: Gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased The shining blade, and golden hangers graced.

<p/>Last o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) brows his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) fourfold helm he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) placed, With nodding horse-hair formidably graced; And in his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) hands two steely javelins wields, That blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.
<p/>That instant Juno, and the martial maid, In happy thunders promised Greece their aid; High o'er the chief they clash'd their arms in air, And, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.
<p/>Close to the limits of the trench and mound, The fiery coursers to their chariots bound The squires restrain'd: the foot, with those who wield The lighter arms, rush forward to the field.

<p/>As the red star now shows his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sanguine fires Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires, Thus through the ranks
<p/>appear'd the godlike man, Plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van; While streamy sparkles, restless as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flies, Flash from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, as lightning from the skies.
<p/>As sweating reapers in some wealthy field, Ranged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield, Bear down the furrows, till their labours meet; Thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:
<p/>So Greece and Troy the field of war divide, And falling ranks are strow'd on every side. None stoop'd a thought to base inglorious flight;-LRB-221-RRB-
<p/>But horse to horse, and man to man they fight, Not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey; Each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.
<p/>Discord alone, of all the immortal train, Swells the red horrors of this direful plain: The gods in peace their golden mansions fill, Ranged in bright order on the Olympian hill:
<p/>Discord with joy the scene of death descries, And drinks large slaughter at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sanguine eyes: But general murmurs told their griefs above, And each accused the partial will of Jove.
<p/>Meanwhile apart, superior, and alone, The eternal Monarch, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Monarch</b></font>) awful throne, Wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate; And fix'd, fulfill'd the just decrees of fate.
<p/>On earth he (<font color='blue'><b>Monarch</b></font>) turn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Monarch</b></font>) all-considering eyes, And mark'd the spot where Ilion's towers arise; The sea with ships, the fields with armies spread, The victor's rage, the dying, and the dead.
<p/>Thus while the morning-beams, increasing bright, O'er heaven's pure azure spread the glowing light, Commutual death the fate of war confounds, Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.
<p/>But now -LRB-what time in some sequester'd vale The weary woodman spreads his (<font color='blue'><b>woodman</b></font>) sparing meal, When his (<font color='blue'><b>woodman</b></font>) tired arms refuse the axe to rear, And claim a respite from the sylvan war; But not till half the prostrate forests lay Stretch'd in long ruin, and exposed to day-RRB-
<p/>Great Agamemnon then the slaughter led, And slew Bienor at his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) people's head: Whose squire Oileus, with a sudden spring, Leap'd from the chariot to revenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) king; But in his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) front he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) felt the fatal wound, Which pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) brain, and stretch'd him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) on the ground.
<p/>Then, nor till then, the Greeks' impulsive might Pierced the black phalanx, and let in the light. Atrides spoil'd, and left them on the plain: Vain was their youth,
<p/>their glittering armour vain: Now soil'd with dust, and naked to the sky, Their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie. Two sons of Priam next to battle move, The product, one of marriage, one of love:-LRB-222-RRB-
<p/>In the same car the brother-warriors ride; This took the charge to combat, that to guide: Far other task, than when they wont to keep, On Ida's tops, their father's fleecy sheep.
<p/>These on the mountains once Achilles found, And captive led, with pliant osiers bound; Then to their sire for ample sums restored; But now to perish by Atrides' sword: Pierced in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds:
<p/>Cleft through the head his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) brother's fate succeeds, Swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls, And, stript, their features to his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) mind recalls.
<p/>The Trojans see the youths untimely die, But helpless tremble for themselves, and fly. So when a lion ranging o'er the lawns.
<p/>Finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns, Their bones he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) cracks, their reeking vitals draws, And grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws; The frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay, But swift through rustling thickets bursts her (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) way; All drown'd in sweat, the panting mother flies, And the big tears roll trickling from her (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Amidst the tumult of the routed train, The sons of false Antimachus were slain; He (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) who for bribes his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) faithless counsels sold, And voted Helen's stay for Paris' gold.
<p/>Atrides mark'd, as these their safety sought, And slew the children for the father's fault; Their headstrong horse unable to restrain, They shook with fear, and dropp'd the silken rein; Then in the chariot on their knees they fall, And thus with lifted hands for mercy call: ``O spare our youth, and for the life we owe, Antimachus shall copious gifts bestow: Soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hears, that, not in battle slain, The Grecian ships his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) captive sons detain, Large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told, And steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold.
<p/>These words, attended with the flood of tears, The youths address'd to unrelenting ears: The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply: <div class="bookquote">``If from Antimachus ye spring, ye die; The daring wretch who once in council stood To shed Ulysses' and my brother's blood, For proffer'd peace! and sues his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) seed for grace?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The monarch</b></font>)</div>No, die, and pay the forfeit of your race. '' This said, Pisander from the car he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) cast, And pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) breast: supine he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) breathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) last.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) brother leap'd to earth; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) lay, The trenchant falchion lopp'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) hands away; His (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) sever'd head was toss'd among the throng, And, rolling, drew a bloody train along.
<p/>Then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew; The king's example all his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) Greeks pursue. Now by the foot the flying foot were slain, Horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.
<p/>The brass-hoof'd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound, And the thick thunder beats the labouring ground, Still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds; The distanced army wonders at his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) deeds, As when the winds with raging flames conspire, And o'er the forests roll the flood of fire,
<p/>In blazing heaps the grove's old honours fall, And one refulgent ruin levels all: Before Atrides' rage so sinks the foe, Whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.
<p/>The steeds fly trembling from his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) waving sword, And many a car, now lighted of its lord, Wide o'er the field with guideless fury rolls, Breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls; While his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) keen falchion drinks the warriors' lives; More grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!
<p/>From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise, Shade the black host, and intercept the skies. Perhaps great Hector then had found his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fate, But Jove and destiny prolong'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) date.
<p/>Safe from the darts, the care of heaven he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stood, Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood. Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay, Through the mid field the routed urge their way:
<p/>Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown, The path they take, and speed to reach the town. As swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued, Hot with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) toil, and bathed in hostile blood.
<p/>Now near the beech-tree, and the Scaean gates, The hero halts, and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) associates waits. Meanwhile on every side around the plain, Dispersed, disorder'd, fly the Trojan train.
<p/>The lion's roaring through the midnight shade; On heaps they tumble with successless haste; The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.
<p/>So flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay'd Not with less fury stern Atrides flew, Still press'd the rout, and still the hindmost slew;
<p/>Hurl'd from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd, And rage, and death, and carnage load the field. Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall; Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.
<p/>But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills, And down their summits pour'd a hundred rills: The unkindled lightning in his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) took, And thus the many-coloured maid bespoke: <div class="bookquote">``Iris, with haste thy golden wings display, To godlike Hector this our word convey--

<p/>But when, or wounded by the spear or dart, That chief shall mount his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) chariot, and depart, Then Jove shall string his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) arm, and fire his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) breast, Then to her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) ships shall flying Greece be press'd,

<p/>While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around, Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground, Abstain from fight; yet issue forth commands, And trust the war to less important hands: But when, or wounded by the spear or dart, The chief shall mount his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) chariot, and depart, Then Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast, Then to her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) ships shall flying Greece be press'd,
<p/>The goddess then: <div class="bookquote">``O son of Priam, hear! From Jove I come, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) high mandate bear. Till to the main the burning sun descend, And sacred night her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) awful shade extend.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The goddess</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) said, and vanish'd. Hector, with a bound, Springs from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) chariot on the trembling ground, In clanging arms: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) grasps in either hand
<p/>A pointed lance, and speeds from band to band ; Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight, And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.
<p/>New force, new spirit, to each breast returns; The fight renew'd with fiercer fury burns: The king leads on: all fix on him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) their eye, And learn from him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to conquer, or to die.
<p/>They stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare, Condense their powers, and wait the coming war. Ye sacred nine! celestial Muses!
<p/>tell, Who faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) first, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) prowess fell? The great Iphidamas, the bold and young, From sage Antenor and Theano sprung;
<p/>Scarce did the down his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) rosy cheeks invest, And early honour warm his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) generous breast, When the kind sire consign'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) daughter's charms -LRB-Theano's sister-RRB- to his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) youthful arms.
<p/>But call'd by glory to the wars of Troy, He (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) leaves untasted the first fruits of joy; From his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) loved bride departs with melting eyes, And swift to aid his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) dearer country flies.
<p/>Whom from his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) youth his (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) grandsire Cisseus bred, And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed. With twelve black ships
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) reach'd Percope's strand, Thence took the long laborious march by land. Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) springs, Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.
<p/>Atrides first discharged the missive spear; The Trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air. Then near the corslet, at the monarch's heart, With all his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) strength, the youth directs his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) dart:
<p/>But the broad belt, with plates of silver bound, The point rebated, and repell'd the wound. Encumber'd with the dart, Atrides stands, Till, grasp'd with force, he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) wrench'd
<p/>it from his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) hands; At once his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) weighty sword discharged a wound Full on his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) neck, that fell'd him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) to the ground.
<p/>Stretch'd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies, And sleep eternal seals his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) swimming eyes. Oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!
<p/>Thy country's friend; and virtuous, though in vain! No more the youth shall join his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) consort's side, At once a virgin, and at once a bride!
<p/>No more with presents her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) embraces meet, Or lay the spoils of conquest at her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) feet, On whom his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) passion, lavish of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) store, Bestow'd so much, and vainly promised more!
<p/>Unwept, uncover'd, on the plain he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lay, While the proud victor bore his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) arms away. Coon, Antenor's eldest hope, was nigh:
<p/>Tears, at the sight, came starting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) eye, While pierced with grief the much-loved youth he (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) view'd, And the pale features now deform'd with blood.
<p/>Then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) spear, unseen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) time he (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) took, Aim'd at the king, and near his (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) elbow strook. The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part, And through his (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) arm stood forth the barbed dart.
<p/>On Coon rushes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) lifted spear: His (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) brother's corpse the pious Trojan draws, And calls his (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) country to assert his (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) cause; Defends him (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) breathless on the sanguine field, And o'er the body spreads his (<font color='blue'><b>Coon</b></font>) ample shield.
<p/>Atrides, marking an unguarded part, Transfix'd the warrior with his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) brazen dart; Prone on his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) brother's bleeding breast he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) lay, The monarch's falchion lopp'd
<p/>Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) head away: The social shades the same dark journey go, And join each other in the realms below.
<p/>With every weapon art or fury yields: By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone, Whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o'erthrown.
<p/>This, while yet warm distill'd the purple flood; But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood, Then grinding tortures his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) strong bosom rend, Less keen those darts
<p/>The vengeful victor rages round the fields, the fierce Ilythiae send: -LRB-The powers that cause the teeming matron's throes, Sad mothers of unutterable woes!-RRB-
<p/>Stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain, He (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) mounts the car, and gives his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) squire the rein; Then with a voice which fury made more strong, And pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng: <div class="bookquote">``O friends!
<p/>O Greeks! assert your honours won; Proceed, and finish what this arm begun: Lo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay, And envies half the glories of the day.
<p/>Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow, And from their sides the foam descends in snow; Shot through the battle in a moment's space,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>squire rein</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) said: the driver whirls his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) lengthful thong; The horses fly; the chariot smokes along. The wounded monarch at his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) tent they place.
<p/>No sooner Hector saw the king retired, But thus his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) Trojans and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) aids he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fired: <div class="bookquote">``Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!
<p/>Famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face: Now call to mind your ancient trophies won, Your great forefathers' virtues, and your own.
<p/>Behold, the general flies! deserts his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) powers! Lo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours! Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds; And, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds.
<p/>As the bold hunter cheers his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hounds to tear The brindled lion, or the tusky bear: With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart, And springs the foremost with his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) lifted dart: So godlike Hector prompts his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) troops to dare; Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.
<p/>On the black body of the foe he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) pours; As from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers, A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps, Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With words like these the fiery chief alarms His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fainting host, and every bosom warms. Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan's glory crown'd, Beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Muse</b></font>) arm what heroes bit the ground?
<p/>Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died, Opites next was added to their side; Then brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight, Opheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night; Ćsymnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name; The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.
<p/>As when a western whirlwind, charged with storms, Dispels the gather'd clouds that Notus forms: The gust continued, violent and strong, Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along; Now to the skies the foaming billows rears, Now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:
<p/>Now the last ruin the whole host appals; Now Greece had trembled in her (<font color='blue'><b>chiefs</b></font>) wooden walls; But wise Ulysses call'd Tydides forth, His (<font color='blue'><b>chiefs</b></font>) soul rekindled, and awaked his (<font color='blue'><b>chiefs</b></font>) worth.
<p/>Thus, raging Hector, with resistless hands, O'erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands. '' And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!
<p/>Till Hector's arm involve the ships in flame? Haste, let us join, and combat side by side. '' The warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No martial toil I shun, no danger fear; Let Hector come; I wait his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fury here. But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:

<p/>And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sigh'd There slain, they left them in eternal night, Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.
<p/>So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds, Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds. Stern Hector's conquests in the middle plain Stood check'd awhile, and Greece respired again.
<p/>The sons of Merops shone amidst the war; Towering they rode in one refulgent car: In deep prophetic arts their father skill'd, Had warn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children from the Trojan field.
<p/>They rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain; Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms; The stern Tydides strips their shining arms.
<p/>Fate urged them on: the father warn'd in vain; Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies, And rich Hippodamus becomes his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) prize. Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) sight, And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.
<p/>Agastrophus was slain, The far-famed hero of Paeonian strain; Wing'd with his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) fears, on foot he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) strove to fly, His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh: Through broken orders, swifter than the wind, He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) fled, but flying left his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) life behind.
<p/>By Tydeus' lance This Hector sees, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) experienced eyes Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies; Shouts, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) pass'd, the crystal regions rend, And moving armies on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) march attend.
<p/>Great Diomed himself was seized with fear, And thus bespoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) brother of the war: <div class="bookquote">``Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!
<p/>Swift at the word his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) ponderous javelin fled; Nor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.

<p/>Tydides followed to regain his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) lance; While Hector rose, recover'd from the trance, Remounts his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) car, and herds amidst the crowd:
<p/>The Greek pursues him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), and exults aloud: <div class="bookquote">``Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath, Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.

<p/>Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave, A coward's weapon never hurts the brave. Not so this dart, which thou may`st one day feel
<p/>; Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel: Where this but lights, some noble life expires; Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires, Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air, And leaves such objects as distract the fair.
<p/>Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart, Before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) steps, and bending draws the dart: Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds; Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.
<p/>Now on the field Ulysses stands alone, The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on; But stands collected in himself, and whole, And questions thus his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) own unconquer'd soul: <div class="bookquote">``What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?

<p/>Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice, The brave meets danger, and the coward flies. To die or conquer, proves a hero's heart; And, knowing this, I know a soldier's part.
<p/>Such thoughts revolving in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) careful breast, Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd; These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose; And round him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) deep the steely circle grows.
<p/>So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds; He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) grinds his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) ivory tusks; he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) foams with ire; His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire; By these, by those, on every part is plied; And the red slaughter spreads on every side.
<p/>Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell; Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell; Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust, Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
<p/>Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near; Ulysses reach'd him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) with the fatal spear; But to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) aid his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) brother Socus flies, Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.

<p/>As when some huntsman, with a flying spear, From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer; Down his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) cleft side, while fresh the blood distils, He (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills, Till life's warm vapour issuing through the wound, Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround: Just as their jaws his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) prostrate limbs invade, The lion rushes through the woodland shade, The wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away; The lordly savage vindicates his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) prey.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, where the cry directs, his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) course he (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) bends; Ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) pains, A single warrior half a host sustains:
<p/>But soon as Ajax leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) tower-like shield, The scattered crowds fly frighted o'er the field ; Atrides' arm the sinking hero stays, And, saved from numbers, to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) car conveys.
<p/>Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew; And first Doryclus, Priam's son, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) slew, On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound, And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.
<p/>As when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains, Pours from the mountains o'er the deluged plains, And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn, A country's ruins!
<p/>But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far, Raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war: Loud groans proclaim his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) progress through the plain, And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.
<p/>There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose The warrior's fury; there the battle glows; There fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height, His (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.
<p/>to the seas are borne: Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng; Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along. The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around, Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound:
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd, And trembling Greece for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) physician fear'd. To Nestor then Idomeneus begun: <div class="bookquote">``Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son!
<p/>Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away, And great Machaon to the ships convey; A wise physician skill'd our wounds to heal, Is more than armies to the public weal.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Nestor/Wise Nestor/Wise</b></font>)</div>Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) rode The wounded offspring of the healing god. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.
<p/>But now Cebriones, from Hector's car, Survey'd the various fortune of the war: <div class="bookquote">``While here -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) cried-RRB- the flying Greeks are slain, Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.

<p/>Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds, There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds; There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite, And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.
<p/>Thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds; Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds; Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields, O'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.
<p/>The horses' hoofs are bathed in heroes' gore, And, dashing, purple all the car before; The groaning axle sable drops distils, And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.
<p/>Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight, Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light: -LRB-By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone.

<p/>But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part, Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart; Confused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown, Amazed he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stood, with terrors not his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) own.
<p/>Thus the grim lion his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) retreat maintains, Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains; Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls, Though rage impels him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), and though hunger calls, Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires; Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires: So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd, While his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) swoln heart at every step rebell'd.
<p/>As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued, In some wide field by troops of boys pursued, Though round his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) sides a wooden tempest rain, Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain; Thick on his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) hide the hollow blows resound
<p/>, The patient animal maintains his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) ground, Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased, And stirs but slowly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) stirs at last: On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung, The strokes redoubled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) buckler rung;
<p/>Confiding now in bulky strength he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) stands, Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands; Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,
<p/>O'er his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) broad back his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) moony shield he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) threw, And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew. And threats his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) followers with retorted eye.
<p/>While hissing darts descend in iron showers: In his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) broad buckler many a weapon stood, Its surface bristled with a quivering wood; And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain, Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.
<p/>But bold Eurypylus his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) aid imparts, And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts; Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe, Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow; From his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) torn liver the red current flow'd, And his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) slack knees desert their dying load.
<p/>The victor rushing to despoil the dead, From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled; Fix'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) nervous thigh the weapon stood, Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.
<p/>Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired, Yet thus retreating, his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) associates fired: <div class="bookquote">``What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?

<p/>Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine; With goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows, And last with flour the smiling surface strows

<p/>A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>), When the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim. Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent, Unheard approached, and stood before the tent.
<p/>Old Nestor, rising then, the hero led To his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) high seat: the chief refused and said: '''Tis now no season for these kind delays; The great Achilles with impatience stays.
<p/>To great Achilles this respect I owe; Who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe, Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?
<p/>With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds. This to report, my hasty course I bend; Thou know`st the fiery temper of my friend.''

<p/>There first to Jove our solemn rites were paid; An untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid; A bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain To the blue monarch of the watery main.
<p/>In arms we slept, beside the winding flood, While round the town the fierce Epeians stood. Soon as the sun, with all-revealing ray, Flamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.
<p/>The first who fell, beneath my javelin bled; King Augias' son, and spouse of Agamede: -LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) that all simples' healing virtues knew, And every herb that drinks the morning dew:-RRB-

<p/>Two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain. Then Actor's sons had died, but Neptune shrouds The youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.
<p/>O'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng, Collecting spoils, and slaughtering all along, Through wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes, Where o'er the vales the Olenian rocks arose; Till Pallas stopp'd us where Alisium flows.
<p/>Even there the hindmost of the rear I slay, And the same arm that led concludes the day; Then back to Pyle triumphant take my way.
<p/>There to high Jove were public thanks assign'd, As first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind. Such then I was, impell'd by youthful blood; So proved my valour for my country's good.

<p/>'' Achilles with unactive fury glows, And gives to passion what to Greece he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) owes. A bull to Jove he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) slew in sacrifice, And pour'd libations on the flaming thighs.
<p/>Thyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire Menoetius, turn'd the fragments on the fire. Achilles sees us, to the feast invites; Social we sit, and share the genial rites.
<p/>We then explained the cause on which we came, Urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame. Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave; Peleus said only this:--`My son! be brave.'
<p/>Menoetius thus: `Though great Achilles shine In strength superior, and of race divine, Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend; Let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'
<p/>Ah! try the utmost that a friend can say: Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey; Some favouring god Achilles' heart may move; Though deaf to glory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) may yield to love.
<p/>Thus spoke your father at Thessalia's court: Words now forgot, though now of vast import. If some dire oracle his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) breast alarm, If aught from Heaven withhold his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) saving arm,
<p/>If thou but lead the Myrmidonian line; Clad in Achilles' arms, if thou appear, Proud Troy may tremble, and desist from war; Press'd by fresh forces, her (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>) o'er-labour'd train

<p/>Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine, Shall seek their walls, and Greece respire again. '' The sable blood in circles mark'd the ground.
<p/>As faintly reeling he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) confess'd the smart, Weak was his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pace, but dauntless was his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart. Divine compassion touch'd Patroclus' breast,

<p/>The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas advises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot.
<p/>HERCULES. BOOK XII. ARGUMENT. THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL. The Trojans follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) counsel; and having divided their army into five bodies of foot, begin the assault.
<p/>But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) talons, which appeared on the left hand of the Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again.
<p/>Hector also, casting a stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters at the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to their ships.
<p/>While thus the hero's pious cares attend The cure and safety of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) wounded friend, Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage, And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.
<p/>Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose; With gods averse the ill-fated works arose; Their powers neglected, and no victim slain, The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.
<p/>This Hector opposes, and continues the attack; in which, after many actions, Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall. Without the gods, how short a period stands The proudest monument of mortal hands!
<p/>While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged; But when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarpedon</b></font>) sons were slain, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarpedon</b></font>) city burn'd, And what survived of Greece to Greece return'd; Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,
<p/>Then Ida's summits pour'd their watery store; Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills, Caresus roaring down the stony hills, Ćsepus, Granicus, with mingled force, And Xanthus foaming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sarpedon</b></font>) fruitful source; And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main-LRB-224-RRB-
<p/>These, turn'd by Phoebus from their wonted ways, Deluged the rampire nine continual days; The weight of waters saps the yielding wall, And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.
<p/>This stood while Hector and Achilles raged. Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain: Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours, And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.
<p/>The god of ocean, marching stern before, With his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) huge trident wounds the trembling shore, Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves, And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.
<p/>Now smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the flood, No fragment tells where once the wonder stood; In their old bounds the rivers roll again, Shine `twixt the hills, or wander o'er the plain.-LRB-225-RRB-
<p/>But this the gods in later times perform; As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm; The strokes yet echoed of contending powers; War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd
<p/>the towers. Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay, Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay: Hector's approach in every wind they hear, And Hector's fury every moment fear.
<p/>So `midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands, Fierce of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) might, a boar or lion stands; Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form, And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) powers untamed, their bold assault defy, And where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) turns the rout disperse or die: He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) foams, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) glares, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) bounds against them all,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng, Mingled the troops, and drove the field along. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) falls, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) courage makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fall.
<p/>The panting steeds impatient fury breathe, And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath; Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground, And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.
<p/>With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows; Exhorts his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) armies, and the trenches shows. Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep, Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep; The bottom bare, -LRB-a formidable show!-RRB-
<p/>And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below. The foot alone this strong defence could force, And try the pass impervious to the horse.
<p/>This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave, Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave: <div class="bookquote">``O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!
<p/>And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands! What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find, The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?
<p/>No pass through those, without a thousand wounds, No space for combat in yon narrow bounds. Proud of the favours mighty
<p/>Jove has shown, On certain dangers we too rashly run: If 'tis will our haughty foes to tame, Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!
<p/>Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall, And one great day destroy and bury all! But should they turn, and here oppress our train, What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?
<p/>Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused, In one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised, All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail, Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.
<p/>Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed; Back from the trenches let your steeds be led; Then all alighting, wedged in firm array, Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.
<p/>So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power, And this -LRB-if Jove consent-RRB- her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fatal hour.''  (<font color='red'><b>this counsel</b></font>)</div>-LSB-Illustration: POLYDAMAS ADVISING HECTOR.-RSB- POLYDAMAS ADVISING HECTOR.
<p/>This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung Swift from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) seat; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) clanging armour rung. The chief's example follow'd by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) train
<p/>, Each quits his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) car, and issues on the plain, By orders strict the charioteers enjoin'd Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.
<p/>The forces part in five distinguish'd bands, And all obey their several chiefs' commands. The best and bravest in the first conspire, Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:

<p/>The sons of Priam with the third appear, Deiphobus, and Helenas the seer; In arms with these the mighty Asius stood, Who drew from Hyrtacus his (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) noble blood, And whom Arisba's yellow coursers bore
<p/>, The coursers fed on Selle's winding shore. Antenor's sons the fourth battalion guide, And great Ćneas, born on fountful Ide.
<p/>Divine Sarpedon the last band obey'd, Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid. Next him (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>), the bravest, at their army's head, But he (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) more brave than all the hosts he (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) led.
<p/>Now with compacted shields in close array, The moving legions speed their headlong way: Already in their hopes they fire the fleet, And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.
<p/>While every Trojan thus, and every aid, The advice of wise Polydamas obey'd, Asius alone, confiding in his (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) car, His (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.
<p/>and advised in vain; Those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain; No more those coursers with triumphant joy Restore their master to the gates of Troy!
<p/>Fierce to the left he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) drives, where from the plain The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain; Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass'd, The gates half-open'd to receive the last.
<p/>Thither, exulting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) force, he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) flies: His (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) following host with clamours rend the skies: To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main, Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!
<p/>Unhappy hero! Black death attends behind the Grecian wall, And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall! To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,
<p/>As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise; Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies: Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown'd, Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground; High on the hills appears their stately form, And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.
<p/>Who from the Lapiths' warlike race descend; This Polypoetes, great Perithous' heir, And that Leonteus, like the god of war. So graceful these, and so the shock they stand Of raging Asius, and his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) furious band.
<p/>In vain around them beat their hollow shields; The fearless brothers on the Grecians call, To guard their navies, and defend the wall.
<p/>Orestes, Acamas, in front appear, And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear: In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields, Even when they saw Troy's sable troops impend, And Greece tumultuous from her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) towers descend,
<p/>So two wild boars spring furious from their den, Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men; On every side the crackling trees they tear, And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare
<p/>Forth from the portals rush'd the intrepid pair, Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war. ; They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll, Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.
<p/>Around their heads the whistling javelins sung, With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung; Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers Maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers: To save their fleet their last efforts they try, And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.
<p/>As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings The dreary winter on his (<font color='blue'><b>mann</b></font>) frozen wings; Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow Descend, and whiten all the fields below: So fast the darts on either army pour, So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower: Heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields, And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.
<p/>With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven, The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven: <div class="bookquote">``In powers immortal who shall now believe?
<p/>Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive? What man could doubt but Troy's victorious power Should humble Greece, and this her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fatal hour?
<p/>But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive, To guard the entrance of their common hive, Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings
<p/>They strike the assailants, and infix their stings; A race determined, that to death contend: So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.
<p/>These empty accents mingled with the wind, Nor moved great Jove's unalterable mind; To godlike Hector and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) matchless might Was owed the glory of the destined fight.
<p/>Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried, And all the gates sustain'd an equal tide; Through the long walls the stony showers were heard
<p/>Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates, Repel an army, and defraud the fates?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>, The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.
<p/>While Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war, Secure of death, confiding in despair; And all her (<font color='blue'><b>warriors</b></font>) guardian gods, in deep dismay, With unassisting arms deplored the day.
<p/>The spirit of a god my breast inspire, To raise each act to life, and sing with fire! Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.
<p/>First Damasus, by Polypoetes' steel, Pierced through his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) helmet's brazen visor, fell; The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore! The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!
<p/>Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death; First through the belt Hippomachus he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) gored, Then sudden waved his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) unresisted sword: Antiphates, as through the ranks he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) broke, The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke: Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled; And round him (<font color='blue'><b>Menon</b></font>) rose a monument of dead.
<p/>Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew, Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue; Fierce with impatience on the works to fall, And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.
<p/>Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath: These on the farther bank now stood and gazed, By Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:
<p/>A signal omen stopp'd the passing host, Their martial fury in their wonder lost. Jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies
<p/>; A bleeding serpent of enormous size, His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) talons truss'd; alive, and curling round, He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stung the bird, whose throat received the wound: Mad with the smart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) drops the fatal prey,
<p/>In airy circles wings his (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) painful way, Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries: Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.
<p/>Then first Polydamas the silence broke, Long weigh'd the signal, and to Hector spoke: <div class="bookquote">``How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear, For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?
<p/>They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd, And Jove's portent with beating hearts behold. True to those counsels which I judge the best, I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.
<p/>In peace, in war, in council, and in fight; And all I move, deferring to thy sway, But tends to raise that power which I obey.
<p/>Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain; For sure, to warn us, Jove his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) omen sent, And thus my mind explains its clear event:
<p/>The victor eagle, whose sinister flight Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright, Dismiss'd his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) conquest in the middle skies, Allow'd to seize, but not possess the prize;
<p/>Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet, Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet, Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed; More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.
<p/>To speak his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) thoughts is every freeman's right, Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain! So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise; For thus a skilful seer would read the skies.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Hector/HECTOR/Stern</b></font>)</div>To him (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) then Hector with disdain return'd: -LRB-Fierce as he (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>seer</b></font>) eyes with fury burn'd:-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?
<p/>Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong: Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent, Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.
<p/>What coward counsels would thy madness move Against the word, the will reveal'd of Jove? The leading sign, the irrevocable nod, And happy thunders of the favouring god
<p/>, These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind By wandering birds that flit with every wind? Ye vagrants of the sky!
<p/>your wings extend, Or where the suns arise, or where descend; To right, to left, unheeded take your way, While I the dictates of high heaven obey.
<p/>Without a sign his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sword the brave man draws, And asks no omen but his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) country's cause. But why should`st thou suspect the war's success?
<p/>None fears it more, as none promotes it less: Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire, Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.
<p/>Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests Spread their cold poison through our soldiers' breasts, My javelin can revenge so base a part, And free the soul that quivers in thy heart.
<p/>Furious he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) spoke, and, rushing to the wall, Calls on his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) host; his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) host obey the call; With ardour follow where their leader flies: Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.
<p/>Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide, And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide; He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) fills the Greeks with terror and dismay, And gives great Hector the predestined day.
<p/>Troy and her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) sons may find a general grave, But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Strong in themselves, but stronger in his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) aid, Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.
<p/>In vain the mounds and massy beams defend, While these they undermine, and those they rend; Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall; And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.
<p/>Greece on her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) ramparts stands the fierce alarms; The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms, Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row; Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.
<p/>The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower, And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power. The generous impulse every Greek obeys; Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.
<p/>'' Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame, And you, whose ardour hopes an equal name! Since not alike endued with force or art;
<p/>Behold a day when each may act his (<font color='blue'><b>Fellows</b></font>) part! A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold, To gain new glories, or augment the old.
<p/>Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite; Drown Hector's vaunts in loud exhorts of fight; Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;
<p/>Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall; So Jove once more may drive their routed train, And Troy lie trembling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) walls again.
<p/>'' Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers; And now the stones descend in heavier showers. As when high Jove his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sharp artillery forms, And opes his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) cloudy magazine of storms;
<p/>In winter's bleak un comfortable reign, A snowy inundation hides the plain; He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep; Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep; And first the mountain-tops are cover'd o'er, Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;
<p/>Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen, And one bright waste hides all the works of men: The circling seas, alone absorbing all, Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:
<p/>So from each side increased the stony rain, And the white ruin rises o'er the plain. Thus godlike Hector and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) troops contend To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:
<p/>Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield, Till great Sarpedon tower'd amid the field; For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) matchless son, and urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) on to fame.
<p/>In arms he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) shines, conspicuous from afar, And bears aloft his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) ample shield in air; Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll'd, Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold: And while two pointed javelins arm his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) hands, Majestic moves along, and leads his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) Lycian bands.
<p/>So press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow Descends a lion on the flocks below ; So stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,
<p/>In sullen majesty, and stern disdain: In vain loud mastiffs bay him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) from afar, And shepherds gall him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) with an iron war; Regardless, furious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) pursues his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) way; He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) foams, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) roars, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) rends the panting prey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) views the towers, and meditates their fall, To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall; Then casting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) friend an ardent look, Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) spoke: <div class="bookquote">``Why boast we, Glaucus!
<p/>Where Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain, Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field, And hills where vines their purple harvest yield, Our foaming bowls with

<p/>Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace; The first in valour, as the first in place; That when with wondering eyes our martial bands Behold our deeds transcending our commands, Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state, Whom those that envy dare not imitate!
<p/>Could all our care elude the gloomy grave, Which claims no less the fearful and the brave, For lust of fame I should not vainly dare In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.
<p/>The life, which others pay, let us bestow, And give to fame what we to nature owe; Brave though we fall, and
<p/>But since, alas! ignoble age must come, Disease, and death's inexorable doom honour'd if we live, Or let us glory gain, or glory give!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) said; his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) words the listening chief inspire With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire; The troops pursue their leaders with delight, Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.
<p/>Menestheus from on high the storm beheld Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field: Around the walls he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) gazed, to view from far What aid appear'd to avert the approaching war, And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood, Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.
<p/>In vain he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) calls; the din of helms and shields Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields, The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound, Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground Then thus to Thoos: <div class="bookquote">``Hence with speed -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) said-RRB-, And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid; Their strength, united, best may help to bear The bloody labours of the doubtful war: Hither the Lycian princes bend their course, The best and bravest of the hostile force.
<p/>But if too fiercely there the foes contend, Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend, And Teucer haste with his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) unerring bow To share the danger, and repel the foe.
<p/>Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng, And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore, Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.
<p/>Your aid -LRB-said Thoos-RRB- Peteus' son demands; Your strength, united, best may help to bear The bloody labours of the doubtful war: Thither the Lycian princes bend their course, The best and bravest of the hostile force.

<p/>Ajax turn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) care, And thus bespoke his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brothers of the war: <div class="bookquote">``Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might, And, brave Oileus, prove your force in fight; To you I trust the fortune of the field,
<p/>Till by this arm the foe shall be repell'd: That done, expect me to complete the day Then with his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) sevenfold shield he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) strode away.
<p/>High on the walls appear'd the Lycian powers, Like some black tempest gathering round the towers: The Greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite, Prepared to labour in the unequal fight: The war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise; Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.
<p/>With equal steps bold Teucer press'd the shore, Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore. Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades, And sends the brave Epicles to the shades, Sarpedon's friend.
<p/>Across the warrior's way, Rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay; In modern ages not the strongest swain Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain: He (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high, It flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;
<p/>As skilful divers from some airy steep Headlong descend, and shoot into the deep, So falls Epicles; then in groans expires, And murmuring to the shades the soul retires.
<p/>While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew, From Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew; The bearded shaft the destined passage found, And on his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) naked arm inflicts a wound.
<p/>The chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast Might stop the progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) warlike host, Conceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) height Retired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.
<p/>Full on the Lycian's helmet thundering down , The ponderous ruin crush'd his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) batter'd crown. Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;
<p/>Alcmaon first was doom'd his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) force to feel; Deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) breast he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) plunged the pointed steel; Then from the yawning wound with fury tore The spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) beating breast with generous ardour glows, He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) springs to fight, and flies upon the foes. Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound, His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) brazen armour rings against the ground.
<p/>Swift to the battlement the victor flies, Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies: It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield; The rolling ruins smoke along the field.
<p/>A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare; And, like a deluge, rushes in the war. At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow, And Ajax sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) javelin at the foe; Fix'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) belt
<p/>the feather'd weapon stood, And through his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) buckler drove the trembling wood; But Jove was present in the dire debate, To shield his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) offspring, and avert his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) fate.
<p/>The prince gave back, not meditating flight, But urging vengeance, and severer fight; Then raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms, His (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) fainting squadrons to new fury warms.
<p/>The breach lies open, but your chief in vain Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain: Unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall: The force of powerful union conquers all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>brothers</b></font>)</div>O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast? Your former fame and ancient virtue lost! '' This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew; They join, they thicken, and the assault renew:
<p/>Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare, And fix'd support the weight of all the war; Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,
<p/>As on the confines of adjoining grounds, Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds; They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield, One foot, one inch, of the contended field; Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall; Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.
<p/>Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound, Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound; The copious slaughter covers all the shore, And the high ramparts drip with human gore.
<p/>As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads, From side to side the trembling balance nods, -LRB-While some laborious matron, just and poor, With nice exactness weighs her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) woolly store,-RRB-
<p/>Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers. Till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends Each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:-LRB-227-RRB-
<p/>So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might, With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight. Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) flies, And fires his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) host with loud repeated cries.
<p/>They hear, they run; and, gathering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) call, Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall: Around the works a wood of glittering spears Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.
<p/>A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw, Pointed above, and rough and gross below: Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise, Such men as live in these degenerate days: Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear The snowy fleece, he (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) toss'd, and shook in air; For Jove upheld, and lighten'd of its load The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.
<p/>Thus arm'd, before the folded gates he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) came, Of massy substance, and stupendous frame; With iron bars and brazen hinges strong, On lofty beams of solid timber hung:
<p/>Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway, Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way, The folds are shatter'd; from the crackling door Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.
<p/>'' Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands, Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands! '' Now rushing in, the furious chief appears, Gloomy as night!
<p/>and shakes two shining spears:-LRB-228-RRB- A dreadful gleam from his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) bright armour came, And from his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) eye-balls flash'd the living flame.
<p/>Then pouring after, through the gaping space, A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place; The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly; The shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) moves a god, resistless in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) course, And seems a match for more than mortal force. -LSB-Illustration: GREEK ALTAR.-RSB- GREEK ALTAR.
<p/>Neptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the fortification forced by Hector, -LRB-who had entered the gate near the station of the Ajaces,-RRB- assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires those heroes to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>): then, in the form of one of the generals, encourages the other Greeks who had retired to their vessels.
<p/>BOOK XIII. ARGUMENT. THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS: THE ACTS OF IDOMENEUS. The Ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector and the Trojans.
<p/>Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones, losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent of Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two warriors, who return together to the battle.
<p/>Idomeneus signalizes his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) courage above the rest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous: Deiphobus and Ćneas march against him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), and at length Idomeneus retires.
<p/>The Trojans are repulsed on the left wing; Hector still keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) ground against the Ajaces, till, being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to call a council of war: Hector approves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) advice, but goes first to rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again, and renews the attack.
<p/>Menelaus wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the Grecian wall and the sea-shore.
<p/>When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast Had fix'd great Hector and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) conquering host, He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) left them to the fates, in bloody fray To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.
<p/>To where the Mysians prove their martial force, And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse; And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays, Renown'd for justice and for length of days;-LRB-229-RRB-
<p/>that, innocent of blood, From milk, innoxious, seek their simple food: Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene Of guilty Troy, of arms, and dying men:
<p/>Then turn'd to Thracia from the field of fight Those eyes that shed insufferable light, Thrice happy race! No aid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) deems, to either host is given, While his (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) high law suspends the powers of Heaven.
<p/>In Samothracia, on a mountain's brow, Whose waving woods o'erhung the deeps below, He (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) sat; and round him (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) azure eyes Where Ida's misty tops confusedly rise; Below, fair Ilion's glittering spires were seen; The crowded ships and sable seas between.
<p/>Meantime the monarch of the watery main Observed the Thunderer, nor observed in vain. There, from the crystal chambers of the main Emerged, he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) sat, and mourn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) Argives slain.
<p/>; Fierce as he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) pass'd, the lofty mountains nod, The forest shakes; earth trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) trod, And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.
<p/>At Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung, Prone down the rocky steep he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) rush'd along From realm to realm three ample strides he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) took,
<p/>Far in the bay his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) shining palace stands, Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands: This having reach'd, his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) brass-hoof'd steeds he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) reins, Fleet as the winds, and deck'd with golden manes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) mounts the car, the golden scourge applies, He (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) sits superior, and the chariot flies: His (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep; The enormous monsters rolling o'er the deep Gambol around him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) on the watery way, And heavy whales in awkward measures play; The sea subsiding spreads a level plain, Exults, and owns the monarch of the main; The parting waves before his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) coursers fly; The wondering waters leave his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) axle dry.
<p/>Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave, Between where Tenedos the surges lave, And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave: There the great ruler of the azure round Stopp'd his (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) swift chariot, and his (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) steeds unbound, Fed with ambrosial herbage from his (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) hand,
<p/>And, at the fourth, the distant Ćgae shook. Refulgent arms his (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) mighty limbs infold, Immortal arms of adamant and gold. And link'd their fetlocks with a golden band, Infrangible, immortal: there they stay:
<p/>The father of the floods pursues his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way: Where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around, Or fiery deluge that devours the ground, The impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng, Embattled roll'd, as Hector rush'd along: To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry The heavens re-echo, and the shores reply: They vow destruction to the Grecian name, And in their hopes the fleets already flame.
<p/>But Neptune, rising from the seas profound, The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground, Now wears a mortal form; like Calchas seen, Such his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) loud voice, and such his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) manly mien; His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) shouts incessant every Greek inspire, But
<p/>most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire. -LSB-Illustration: NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA.-RSB- NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA. '' 'Tis yours, O warriors, all our hopes to raise: Oh recollect your ancient worth and praise! '
<p/>Tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear; Flight, more than shameful, is destructive here. On other works though Troy with fury fall,
<p/>And pour her (<font color='blue'><b>'T</b></font>) armies o'er our batter'd wall: There Greece has strength: but this, this part o'erthrown, Her (<font color='blue'><b>'T</b></font>) strength were vain; I dread for you alone:
<p/>Here Hector rages like the force of fire, Vaunts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) gods, and calls high Jove his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sire: If yet some heavenly power your breast excite, Breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight, Greece yet may live, her (<font color='blue'><b>'T</b></font>) threaten'd fleet maintain:
<p/>Then with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sceptre, that the deep controls, He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) touch'd the chiefs, and steel'd their manly souls: Strength, not their own, the touch divine imparts, Prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.
<p/>Then, as a falcon from the rocky height, Her (<font color='blue'><b>'T</b></font>) quarry seen, impetuous at the sight, Forth-springing instant, darts herself from high, Shoots on the wing, and skims along the sky:
<p/>And Hector's force, and Jove's own aid, be vain. '' Such, and so swift, the power of ocean flew; The wide horizon shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) from their view.
<p/>The inspiring god Oileus' active son Perceived the first, and thus to Telamon: <div class="bookquote">``Some god, my friend, some god in human form Favouring descends, and wills to stand the storm.
<p/>Not Calchas this, the venerable seer; Short as he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) turned, I saw the power appear: I mark'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) parting, and the steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) trod; His (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) own bright evidence reveals a god.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the god</b></font>)</div>Full of the god that urged their burning breast, The heroes thus their mutual warmth express'd. Neptune meanwhile the routed Greeks inspired;
<p/>Who, breathless, pale, with length of labours tired, Pant in the ships; while Troy to conquest calls, And swarms victorious o'er their yielding walls:
<p/>Trembling before the impending storm they lie, While tears of rage stand burning in their eye. Greece sunk they thought, and this their fatal hour; But breathe new courage as they feel the power.
<p/>; Then stern Peneleus rises to the fight; Thoas, Deipyrus, in arms renown'd, And Merion next, the impulsive fury found; Last Nestor's son the same bold ardour takes,
<p/>Teucer and Leitus first his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) words excite While thus the god the martial fire awakes: <div class="bookquote">``Oh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace To chiefs of vigorous youth, and manly race!

<p/>Heavens! what a prodigy these eyes survey, Unseen, unthought, till this amazing day! Fly we at length from Troy's oft-conquer'd bands?
<p/>And falls our fleet by such inglorious hands? A rout undisciplined, a straggling train, Not born to glories of the dusty plain
<p/>; Like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued, A prey to every savage of the wood: Shall these, so late who trembled at your name, Invade your camps, involve your ships in flame?
<p/>A change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought? The soldiers' baseness, or the general's fault? Fools! will ye perish for your leader's vice; The purchase infamy, and life the price? '
<p/>Tis not your cause, Achilles' injured fame : Another's is the crime, but yours the shame. Grant that our chief offend through rage or lust, Must you be cowards, if your king's unjust?
<p/>Prevent this evil, and your country save : Small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave. Think, and subdue! on dastards dead to fame I waste no anger, for they feel no shame:
<p/>But you, the pride, the flower of all our host, My heart weeps blood to see your glory lost! Nor deem this day, this battle, all you lose; A day more black, a fate more vile, ensues.
<p/>Let each reflect, who prizes fame or breath, On endless infamy, on instant death: For, lo! the fated time, the appointed shore: Hark!
<p/>the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar! Impetuous Hector thunders at the wall; The hour, the spot, to conquer, or to fall.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the god infamy</b></font>)</div>These words the Grecians' fainting hearts inspire, And listening armies catch the godlike fire. Fix'd at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) post was each bold
<p/>So close their order, so disposed their fight, As Pallas' self might view with fix'd delight; Or had the god of war inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) eyes, The god of war had own'd a just surprise.
<p/>Ajax found, With well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round: A chosen phalanx, firm, resolved as fate, Descending Hector and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) battle wait.
<p/>An iron scene gleams dreadful o'er the fields, Armour in armour lock'd, and shields in shields, Spears lean on spears, on targets targets throng, Helms stuck to helms, and man drove man along.
<p/>As when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove; And levell'd at the skies with pointing rays, Their brandish'd lances at each motion blaze.
<p/>Thus breathing death, in terrible array, The close compacted legions urged their way: Fierce they drove on, impatient to destroy; Troy charged the first, and Hector first of Troy.
<p/>As from some mountain's craggy forehead torn, A rock's round fragment flies, with fury borne, -LRB-Which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends,-RRB- Precipitate the ponderous mass descends:
<p/>From steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds; At every shock the crackling wood resounds; Still gathering force, it smokes; and urged amain, Whirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain: There stops--so Hector.
<p/>On him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) the war is bent, the darts are shed, And all their falchions wave around his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) head: Repulsed he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stands, nor from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stand retires; But with repeated shouts his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) army fires.
<p/>The floating plumes unnumber'd wave above, Their whole force he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) proved,-LRB-230-RRB- Resistless when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) raged, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stopp'd, unmoved. ''
<p/>Trojans! be firm; this arm shall make your way Through yon square body, and that black array: Stand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,
<p/>Strong as they seem, embattled like a tower; For he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) that Juno's heavenly bosom warms, The first of gods, this day inspires our arms.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) said; and roused the soul in every breast: Urged with desire of fame, beyond the rest, Forth march'd Deiphobus; but, marching, held Before his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) wary steps his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) ample shield.
<p/>; The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide; But pierced not through: unfaithful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) hand, The point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.
<p/>'' Bold Merion aim'd a stroke -LRB-nor aim'd it wide-RRB- The Trojan warrior, touch'd with timely fear, On the raised orb to distance bore the spear.
<p/>The Greek, retreating, mourn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) frustrate blow, And cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe; Then to the ships with surly speed he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) went, To seek a surer javelin in his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) tent.
<p/>Meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows, The tumult thickens, and the clamour grows. By Teucer's arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds, The son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds.
<p/>Ere yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led, In fair Pedaeus' verdant pastures bred, The youth had dwelt, remote from war's alarms, And blest in bright Medesicaste's arms:
<p/>-LRB-This nymph, the fruit of Priam's ravish'd joy, Allied the warrior to the house of Troy:-RRB- To Troy, when glory call'd his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) came, And match'd the bravest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) chiefs in fame:
<p/>With Priam's sons, a guardian of the throne, He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) lived, beloved and honour'd as his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) own. Him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) Teucer pierced between the throat and ear: He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) groans beneath the Telamonian spear.
<p/>As from some far-seen mountain's airy crown, Subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down, And soils its verdant tresses on the ground; So falls the youth; his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) arms the fall resound.
<p/>Then Teucer rushing to despoil the dead, From Hector's hand a shining javelin fled: He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) saw, and shunn'd the death; the forceful dart Sung on, and pierced Amphimachus's heart, Cteatus' son, of Neptune's forceful line; Vain was his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) courage, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) race divine!
<p/>To seize his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) beamy helm the victor flies, And just had fastened on the dazzling prize, When Ajax' manly arm a javelin flung; Full on the shield's round boss the weapon rung; He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) felt the shock, nor more was doom'd to feel, Secure in mail, and sheath'd in shining steel.
<p/>Prostrate he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) falls; his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) clanging arms resound, And his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) broad buckler thunders on the ground. Repulsed he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) yields; the victor Greeks obtain The spoils contested, and bear off the slain.
<p/>Between the leaders of the Athenian line, -LRB-Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,-RRB- Deplored Amphimachus, sad object! lies; Imbrius remains the fierce Ajaces' prize.
<p/>In their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood, And sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood; So these, the chief: great Ajax from the dead Strips his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) bright arms; Oileus lops his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) head: Toss'd like a ball, and whirl'd in air away, At Hector's feet the gory visage lay.
<p/>The god of ocean, fired with stern disdain, And pierced with sorrow for his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) grandson slain, Inspires the Grecian hearts, confirms their hands, And breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.
<p/>Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet, He (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) finds the lance-famed Idomen of Crete, His (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) pensive brow the generous care
<p/>With which a wounded soldier touch'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) breast, Whom in the chance of war a javelin tore, And his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) sad comrades from the battle bore; Him (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) to the surgeons of the camp he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) sent: That office paid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) issued from his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) tent Fierce for the fight: to whom the god begun, In Thoas' voice,
<p/>As two grim lions bear across the lawn, Snatch'd from devouring hounds, a slaughter'd fawn. express'd Andraemon's valiant son, Who ruled where Calydon's white rocks arise, And Pleuron's chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:

<p/>But those my ship contains; whence distant far, I fight conspicuous in the van of war, What need I more? If any Greek there be

<p/>And to their owners send them nobly back. '' Swift at the word bold Merion snatch'd a spear And, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.
<p/>So Mars armipotent invades the plain, -LRB-The wide destroyer of the race of man,-RRB- Terror, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best-beloved son, attends his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) course, Arm'd with stern boldness, and enormous force; The pride of haughty warriors to confound, And lay the strength of tyrants on the ground: From Thrace they fly, call'd to the dire alarms Of warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms; Invoked by both, relentless they dispose, To these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.
<p/>So march'd the leaders of the Cretan train, And their bright arms shot horror o'er the plain. Then first spake Merion:

<p/>Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld Rush like a fiery torrent o'er the field, Their force embodied in a tide they pour; The rising combat sounds along the shore.
<p/>As warring winds, in Sirius' sultry reign, From different quarters sweep the sandy plain; On every side the dusty whirlwinds rise, And the dry fields are lifted to the skies:
<p/>Thus by despair, hope, rage, together driven, Met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken'd heaven. All dreadful glared the iron face of war, Bristled with upright spears, that
<p/>flash'd afar; Dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields, And polish'd arms emblazed the flaming fields: Tremendous scene! that general horror gave, But touch'd with joy
<p/>the bosoms of the brave. Saturn's great sons in fierce contention vied, And crowds of heroes in their anger died. The sire of earth and heaven, by Thetis won To crown with glory
<p/>While Neptune, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) azure main, Warr'd on the king of heaven with stern disdain, And breathed revenge, and fired the Grecian train.
<p/>Gods of one source, of one ethereal race, Alike divine, and heaven their native place; But Jove the greater; first-born of the skies, And more than men, or gods, supremely wise.
<p/>Peleus' godlike son, Will'd not destruction to the Grecian powers, But spared awhile the destined Trojan towers; For this, of Jove's superior might afraid, Neptune in human form conceal'd his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) aid.
<p/>These powers enfold the Greek and Trojan train In war and discord's adamantine chain, Indissolubly strong: the fatal tie Is stretch'd on both, and close compell'd they die.
<p/>First by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand Othryoneus was slain, Swell'd with false hopes, with mad ambition vain; Call'd by the voice of war to martial fame, From high Cabesus' distant walls he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) came; Cassandra's love he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sought, with boasts of power, And promised conquest was the proffer'd dower.
<p/>Dreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey, The bold Idomeneus controls the day. The king consented, by his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) vaunts abused; The king consented, but the fates refused.
<p/>Proud of himself, and of the imagined bride, The field he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) measured with a larger stride. Him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) stalk'd, the Cretan javelin found; Vain was his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) breastplate to repel the wound:
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) dream of glory lost, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) plunged to hell; His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) arms resounded as the boaster fell.

<p/>To vengeance rising with a sudden spring, He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) hoped the conquest of the Cretan king. The wary Cretan, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) foe drew near, Full on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) throat discharged the forceful spear:
<p/>As when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall, Or pine, fit mast for some great admiral, Groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound, Then spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground: So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day, And stretch'd before his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) much-loved coursers lay.
<p/>Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide, And glitter'd, extant at the further side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore, And, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.
<p/>Deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear, Stands all aghast his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) trembling charioteer, Nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away, But falls
<p/>transfix'd, an unresisting prey: Pierced by Antilochus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) pants beneath The stately car, and labours out his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) breath. Thus Asius' steeds -LRB-their mighty master gone-RRB-
<p/>Remain the prize of Nestor's youthful son. Stabb'd at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh, And made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.
<p/>Beneath the spacious targe, -LRB-a blazing round, Thick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound, On his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) raised arm by two strong braces stay'd,-RRB-
<p/>The Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance From his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) slope shield the disappointed lance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) lay collected in defensive shade.
<p/>Even then the spear the vigorous arm confess'd, And pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor's breast: Warm'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) liver, to the ground it bore The chief, his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) people's guardian now no more! ''
<p/>O'er his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) safe head the javelin idly sung, And on the tinkling verge more faintly rung. Not unattended -LRB-the proud Trojan cries-RRB-
<p/>Nor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies: For thee, through hell's black portals stand display'd , This mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.
<p/>'' Heart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast, Touch'd every Greek, but Nestor's son the most. Grieved as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pious arms attend, And his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) broad buckler shields his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) slaughter'd friend:
<p/>Nor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws; Resolved to perish in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) country's cause, Or find some foe, whom heaven and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) shall doom To wail his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fate in death's eternal gloom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sees Alcathous in the front aspire: Great Ćsyetes was the hero's sire; His (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) spouse Hippodame, divinely fair, Anchises' eldest hope, and darling care: Who charm'd her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) parents' and her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) husband's heart With beauty, sense, and every work of art: He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) once of Ilion's youth the loveliest boy, The fairest she (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) of all the fair of Troy.
<p/>, Who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes, And fetters every limb: yet bent to meet His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fate he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.
<p/>Till sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) honour'd body to the tented shore. By Neptune now the hapless hero dies Fix'd as some column, or deep-rooted oak,
<p/>While the winds sleep; his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) breast received the stroke. Before the ponderous stroke his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) corslet yields, Long used to ward the death in fighting fields.
<p/>The riven armour sends a jarring sound; His (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound, The long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound; Fast flowing from its source, as prone he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) lay, Life's purple tide impetuous gush'd away.
<p/>Then Idomen, insulting o'er the slain: ``Behold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain: See! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend ;
<p/>This, my third victim, to the shades I send. Approaching now thy boasted might approve, And try the prowess of the seed of Jove.
<p/>, enamour'd of a mortal dame, Great Minos, guardian of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) country, came: Deucalion, blameless prince, was Minos' heir; His (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) first-born I, the third from Jupiter: O'er spacious Crete, and her (<font color='blue'><b>dame</b></font>) bold sons, I reign, And thence my ships transport me through the main: Lord of a host, o'er all my host I shine, A scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line.
<p/>The Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet, Alone, with venturous arms the king of Crete, Or seek auxiliar force; at length decreed To call some hero to partake the deed, Forthwith Ćneas rises to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) thought:
<p/>For him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) in Troy's remotest lines he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) sought, Where he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), incensed at partial Priam, stands, And sees superior posts in meaner hands.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), ambitious of so great an aid, The bold Deiphobus approach'd, and said: <div class="bookquote">``Now, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms, If e'er thy bosom felt fair honour's charms.
<p/>From Jove ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Alcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend; Come, and the warrior's loved remains defend. Beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) cares thy early youth was train'd, One table fed you, and one roof contain'd.
<p/>Ćneas heard, and for a space resign'd To tender pity all his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) manly mind; Then rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) rage, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) burns to fight:
<p/>This deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe; Haste, and revenge it on th' insulting foe. '' The Greek awaits him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) with collected might.
<p/>As the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head, Arm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred, When the loud rustics rise, and shout from far, Attends the tumult, and expects the war; O'er his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) bent back the bristly horrors rise; Fires stream in lightning from his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) sanguine eyes,
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) foaming tusks both dogs and men engage; But most his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) hunters rouse his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) mighty rage: So stood Idomeneus, his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) javelin shook, And met the Trojan with a lowering look.
<p/>The youthful offspring of the god of war, Merion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd: To these the warrior sent his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) voice around.
<p/>Antilochus, Deipyrus, were near, '' Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite; Lo, great Ćneas rushes to the fight: Sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold
<p/>; He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old. Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife, The great dispute, of glory, or of life.
<p/>Ćneas too demands Th' assisting forces of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) native bands; Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join; -LRB-Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;-RRB-
<p/>In order follow all th' embodied train, Like Ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain; Before his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fleecy care, erect and bold, Stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd; Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade Around the chief. With joy the swain surveys them, as he (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) leads To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:
<p/>Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose; On every side the steely circle grows; Now batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,
<p/>So joys Ćneas, as his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) native band Moves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land. And o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.
<p/>Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear, There great Idomeneus, Ćneas here. Like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood, And burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.
<p/>whizz'd along in air; The Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear: Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood
<p/>The forceful spear his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) hollow corslet broke, It ripp'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) belly with a ghastly wound, And roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.
<p/>The Trojan weapon Stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood. But OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke; Stretch'd on the plain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) sobs away his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) breath,
<p/>And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death. The victor from his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) breast the weapon tears; His (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) spoils he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) could not, for the shower of spears.
<p/>Though now unfit an active war to wage, Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age, His (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) listless limbs unable for the course, In standing fight he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) yet maintains his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) force; Till faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,
<p/>Deiphobus beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) pass'd, And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast: The javelin err'd, but held its course along, And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) tired slow steps he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) drags from off the field. The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground, And gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wound.
<p/>Nor knew the furious father of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fall; High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall, On golden clouds th' immortal synod sate; Detain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.
<p/>For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray, Deiphobus to seize his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) helmet flies, And from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) temples rends the glittering prize; Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,
<p/>And on his (<font color='blue'><b>Valiant</b></font>) loaded arm discharged his (<font color='blue'><b>Valiant</b></font>) spear: He (<font color='blue'><b>Valiant</b></font>) drops the weight, disabled with the pain; The hollow helmet rings against the plain.
<p/>Swift as a vulture leaping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) prey, From his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) torn arm the Grecian rent away The reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) friends.
<p/>good Polites tends; Around his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) waist his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) pious arms he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) threw, And from the rage of battle gently drew: Him (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) swift coursers, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) splendid car, Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war; To Troy they drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>), groaning from the shore, And sprinkling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) pass'd, the sands with gore.
<p/>Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay, His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) wounded brother Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground, Heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.
<p/>Bold Aphareus by great Ćneas bled; As toward the chief he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) turn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) daring head, He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) throat; the bending head, depress'd Beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) helmet, nods upon his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) breast; His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies, And everlasting slumber seals his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Antilochus, as Thoon turn'd him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) round, Transpierced his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) back with a dishonest wound: The hollow vein, that to the neck extends Along the chine, his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) eager javelin rends:
<p/>Th' exulting victor, leaping where he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) lay, From his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) broad shoulders tore the spoils away; His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) time observed; for closed by foes around, On all sides thick the peals of arms resound.
<p/>Supine he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) falls, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) social train Spreads his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) imploring arms, but spreads in vain. His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains, But he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) impervious and untouch'd remains.
<p/>In arms intrepid, with the first he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fought, Faced every foe, and every danger sought; His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) winged lance, resistless as the wind, Obeys each motion of the master's mind!
<p/>-LRB-Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage This youth, the joy of Nestor's glorious age.-RRB- Restless it flies, impatient to be free, And meditates the distant enemy.
<p/>The son of Asius, Adamas, drew near, And struck his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) target with the brazen spear Fierce in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) front: but Neptune wards the blow, And blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:
<p/>In the broad buckler half the weapon stood, Splinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood. Disarm'd, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) mingled in the Trojan crew; But Merion's spear o'ertook him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) flew,
<p/>Deep in the belly's rim an entrance found, Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound. Bending he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) fell, and doubled to the ground, Lay panting.
<p/>Thus an ox in fetters tied, While death's strong pangs distend his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) labouring side , His (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) bulk enormous on the field displays; His (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.
<p/>Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid: King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade, And smote his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) temples with an arm so strong, The helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:
<p/>The spear the conqueror from his (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) body drew, And death's dim shadows swarm before his (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) view. There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize; For dark in death the godlike owner lies!
<p/>Raging with grief, great Menelaus burns, And fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns: That shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw; And this stood adverse with the bended bow:
<p/>Full on his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) breast the Trojan arrow fell, But harmless bounded from the plated steel. As on some ample barn's well harden'd floor, -LRB-The winds collected at each open door,-RRB-
<p/>While the broad fan with force is whirl'd around, Light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground: So from the steel that guards Atrides' heart, Repell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.
<p/>Atrides, watchful of the unwary foe, Pierced with his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) lance the hand that grasp'd the bow. And nailed it to the yew:
<p/>the wounded hand Trail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand: But good Agenor gently from the wound The spear solicits, and the bandage bound; A sling's soft wool,
<p/>snatch'd from a soldier's side, At once the tent and ligature supplied. Behold! Pisander, urged by fate's decree, Springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee, Great Menelaus!
<p/>to enchance thy fame: High-towering in the front, the warrior came. First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown; The lance far distant by the winds was blown.
<p/>Not so discouraged, to the future blind, Vain dreams of conquest swell his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) haughty mind; Dauntless he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) rushes where the Spartan lord Like lightning brandish'd his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) far beaming sword.
<p/>Nor pierced Pisander through Atrides' shield: Pisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field. His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) left arm high opposed the shining shield:
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held; -LRB-An olive's cloudy grain the handle made, Distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;-RRB-
<p/>This on the helm discharged a noble blow; The plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below, Shorn from the crest. Atrides waved his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) steel:
<p/>Deep through his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) front the weighty falchion fell; The crashing bones before its force gave way; In dust and blood the groaning hero lay:
<p/>And fierce Atrides spurn'd him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) bled, Tore off his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) arms, and, loud-exulting, said: <div class="bookquote">``Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear; O race perfidious, who delight in war!
<p/>Forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore, The clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore. Already noble deeds ye have perform'd; A princess raped transcends a navy storm'd:
<p/>The violated rites, the ravish'd dame; Our heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame, Crimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down, And whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.
<p/>In such bold feats your impious might approve, Without th' assistance, or the fear of Jove. O thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,
<p/>Above the thought of man, supremely wise! If from thy hand the fates of mortals flow, From whence this favour to an impious foe?
<p/>The best of things, beyond their measure, cloy; Sleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy; The feast, the dance; whate'er mankind desire, Even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.
<p/>A godless crew, abandon'd and unjust, Still breathing rapine, violence, and lust? But Troy for ever reaps a dire delight In thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.
<p/>The bloody armour, which his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) train received: Then sudden mix'd among the warring crew, And the bold son of Pylaemenes slew.
<p/>Following his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) martial father to the war: Through filial love he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) native shore, Never, ah, never to behold it more!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) unsuccessful spear he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) chanced to fling Against the target of the Spartan king; Thus of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lance disarm'd, from death he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) flies, And turns around his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) apprehensive eyes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This said, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seized -LRB-while yet the carcase heaved-RRB- Harpalion had through Asia travell'd far, Him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), through the hip transpiercing as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fled, The shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.
<p/>Beneath the bone the glancing point descends, And, driving down, the swelling bladder rends: Sunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sad companions' arms he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lay, And
<p/>in short pantings sobb'd his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) soul away; -LRB-Like some vile worm extended on the ground;-RRB- While life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) car the Paphlagonian train In slow procession bore from off the plain. The pensive father, father now no more!
<p/>Attends the mournful pomp along the shore; And unavailing tears profusely shed; And, unrevenged, deplored his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) offspring dead. Paris from far the moving sight beheld,
<p/>With pity soften'd and with fury swell'd: His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) honour'd host, a youth of matchless grace, And loved of all the Paphlagonian race!
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) full strength he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) angry bow, And wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe. A chief there was, the brave Euchenor named, For riches much, and more for virtue famed.
<p/>Who held his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) seat in Corinth's stately town; Polydus' son, a seer of old renown. Oft had the father told his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) early doom, By arms abroad, or slow disease at home:
<p/>Beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ear the pointed arrow went; The soul came issuing at the narrow vent: His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground, And everlasting darkness shades him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) round.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) climb'd his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) vessel, prodigal of breath, And chose the certain glorious path to death. Nor knew great Hector how his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) legions yield,
<p/>Wide on the left the force of Greece commands, And conquest hovers o'er th' Achaian bands; With such a tide superior virtue sway'd, And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) that shakes the solid earth gave aid.
<p/>-LRB-Wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field:-RRB- But in the centre Hector fix'd remain'd, Where first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain'd;
<p/>And where low walls confine the beating tides, Whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides; Where late in fight both foot and horse engaged, And all the thunder of the battle raged,-RRB- There join'd, the whole Boeotian strength remains,
<p/>The proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains, Locrians and Phthians, and th' Epaean force; But join'd, repel not Hector's fiery course.
<p/>The flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led; Bias and great Menestheus at their head: Meges the strong the Epaean bands controll'd, And Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold: The Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might, And brave Podarces, active in the fight.
<p/>There, on the margin of the hoary deep, -LRB-Their naval station where the Ajaces keep. This drew from Phylacus his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) noble line;
<p/>Iphiclus' son: and that -LRB-Oileus-RRB- thine: -LRB-Young Ajax' brother, by a stolen embrace; He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) dwelt far distant from his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) native place,
<p/>By his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) fierce step-dame from his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) father's reign Expell'd and exiled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) brother slain:-RRB- These rule the Phthians, and their arms employ, Mix'd with Boeotians, on the shores of Troy.
<p/>Now side by side, with like unwearied care, Each Ajax laboured through the field of war: So when two lordly bulls, with equal toil, Force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil, Join'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear, And trace large furrows with the shining share; O'er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow, And streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.
<p/>A train of heroes followed through the field, Who bore by turns great Ajax' sevenfold shield; Whene'er he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) breathed, remissive of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) might, Tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.
<p/>No following troops his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) brave associate grace: In close engagement an unpractised race, The Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield, Nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield; But skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing, Or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling, Dexterous with these
<p/>Thus in the van the Telamonian train, Throng'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain: Far in the rear the Locrian archers lie, Whose stones and arrows intercept the sky, The mingled tempest on the foes they pour; Troy's scattering orders open to the shower.
<p/>Now had the Greeks eternal fame acquired, And the gall'd Ilians to their walls retired; But sage Polydamas, discreetly brave, Address'd great Hector, and this counsel gave: <div class="bookquote">``Though great in all, thou seem`st averse to lend Impartial audience to a faithful friend; To gods and men thy matchless worth is known,
<p/>they aim a certain wound, Or fell the distant warrior to the ground. And every art of glorious war thy own;
<p/>But in cool thought and counsel to excel, How widely differs this from warring well! Content with what the bounteous gods have given, Seek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.
<p/>To some the powers of bloody war belong, To some sweet music and the charm of song; To few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign'd
<p/>A wise, extensive, all-considering mind; Their guardians these, the nations round confess, And towns and empires for their safety bless. If Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast, Attend, O Hector!
<p/>what I judge the best, See, as thou mov`st, on dangers dangers spread, And war's whole fury burns around thy head.
<p/>Behold! distress'd within yon hostile wall, How many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall! What troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain! And what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!
<p/>Here cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings Convoked to council, weigh the sum of things. Whether -LRB-the gods succeeding our desires-RRB-
<p/>To yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires; Or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away, Contented with the conquest of the day.
<p/>I fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone, Pay the large debt of last revolving sun; Achilles, great Achilles, yet remains On yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!''
 (<font color='red'><b>this counsel</b></font>)</div><p/>The counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound, Leap'd from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) chariot on the trembling ground; Swift as he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) leap'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) clanging arms resound.
<p/>To guard this post -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) cried-RRB- thy art employ, And here detain the scatter'd youth of Troy; Where yonder heroes faint, I bend my way, And hasten back to end the doubtful day.
<p/>This said, the towering chief prepares to go, Shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) white plumes that to the breezes flow, And seems a moving mountain topp'd with snow.
<p/>To Panthus' son, at Hector's high command Haste the bold leaders of the Trojan band: But round the battlements, and round the plain, For many a chief he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) look'd, but look'd in vain; Deiphobus, nor Helenus the seer, Nor Asius' son, nor Asius' self appear: For these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,
<p/>Some cold in death, some groaning on the ground; Some low in dust, -LRB-a mournful object-RRB- lay; High on the wall some breathed their souls away.
<p/>'' '' Through all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) host, inspiring force, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) flies, And bids anew the martial thunder rise. Far on the left, amid the throng he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) found -LRB-Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around-RRB-
<p/>The graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved, Opprobrious thus, th' impatient chief reproved: ``Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind, As smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!
<p/>Where is Deiphobus, where Asius gone? The godlike father, and th' intrepid son? The force of Helenus, dispensing fate; And great Othryoneus, so fear'd of late?
<p/>Black fate hang's o'er thee from th' avenging gods, Imperial Troy from her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) foundations nods; Whelm'd in thy country's ruin shalt thou fall, And one devouring vengeance swallow all.
<p/>When Paris thus: <div class="bookquote">``My brother and my friend, Thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend, In other battles I deserved thy blame, Though then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:
<p/>The chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain; Of all those heroes, two alone remain; Deiphobus, and Helenus the seer
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But since yon rampart by thy arms lay low, I scatter'd slaughter from my fatal bow. , Each now disabled by a hostile spear.
<p/>Go then, successful, where thy soul inspires: This heart and hand shall second all thy fires: What with this arm I can, prepare to know,
<p/>Till death for death be paid, and blow for blow. But 'tis not ours, with forces not our own To combat: strength is of the gods alone.
<p/>Around Polydamas, distain'd with blood, Cebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood, Palmus, with Polypoetes the divine, And two bold brothers of Hippotion's line -LRB-Who reach'd fair Ilion, from Ascania far, The former day; the next engaged in war-RRB-.
<p/>As when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs, That bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful wings, Wide o'er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps; Then, gather'd, settles on the hoary deeps; The afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar; The waves behind impel the waves before, Wide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore:
<p/>'' These words the hero's angry mind assuage: Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage. Thus rank on rank, the thick battalions throng, Chief urged on chief, and man drove man along.
<p/>Far o'er the plains, in dreadful order bright, The brazen arms reflect a beamy light: Full in the blazing van great Hector shined, Like Mars commission'd to confound mankind.
<p/>Before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) flaming his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) enormous shield, Like the broad sun, illumined all the field; His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) nodding helm emits a streamy ray; His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) piercing eyes through all the battle stray, And, while beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) targe he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) flash'd along, Shot terrors round, that
<p/>wither'd e`en the strong. Thus stalk'd he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), dreadful; death was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) look: Whole nations fear'd; but not an Argive shook.
<p/>The towering Ajax, with an ample stride, Advanced the first, and thus the chief defied: ``Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear; '
<p/>Tis not thy arm, 'tis thundering Jove we fear: The skill of war to us not idly given, Lo! Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but
<p/>Heaven. Vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts, To force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts. Long ere in flames our lofty navy fall,
<p/>Your boasted city, and your god-built wall, Shall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground; And spread a long unmeasured ruin round.
<p/>The time shall come, when, chased along the plain, Even thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain; Even thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course, The wings of falcons for thy flying horse; Shalt run, forgetful of a warrior's fame, While clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame.
<p/>To Jove's glad omen all the Grecians rise, And hail, with shouts, his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) progress through the skies: Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side; They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied: <div class="bookquote">``From whence this menace, this insulting strain?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Troy</b></font>)</div>As thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) spoke, behold, in open view, On sounding wings a dexter eagle flew. Enormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.
<p/>So may the gods on Hector life bestow, -LRB-Not that short life which mortals lead below, But such as those of Jove's high lineage born, The blue-eyed maid, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) that gilds the morn,-RRB- As this decisive day shall end the fame Of Greece, and Argos be no more a name.
<p/>The lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate: That giant-corse, extended on the shore, Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) said; and like a lion stalk'd along: With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung, Sent from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) following host: the Grecian train With answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain; A shout that tore heaven's concave, and, above, Shook the fix'd splendours of the throne of Jove.

<p/>Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the increasing clamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) way he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) meets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) informs of the extremity of the danger.
<p/>Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) advice, that, wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence, which advice is pursued.
<p/>Juno, seeing the partiality of Jupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to over-reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sets off her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) charms with the utmost care, and -LRB-the more surely to enchant him (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>)-RRB- obtains the magic girdle of Venus.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) then applies herself to the god of sleep, and, with some difficulty, persuades him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) to seal the eyes of Jupiter:
<p/>this done, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first sight, is ravished with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) beauty, sinks in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) embraces, and is laid asleep.
<p/>Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax, and carried off from the battle: several actions succeed, till the Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the lesser Ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner.
<p/>But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl, Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul; His (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) startled ears the increasing cries attend; Then thus, impatient, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) wounded friend: <div class="bookquote">``What new alarm, divine Machaon, say, What mix'd events attend this mighty day?

<p/>Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care, Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare, Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore; While I the adventures of the day explore.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) said: and, seizing Thrasymedes' shield, -LRB-His (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) valiant offspring,-RRB- hasten'd to the field; -LRB-That day the son his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's buckler bore;-RRB-

<p/>the tumult of the fight, The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight. As when old ocean's silent surface sleeps, The waves just heaving on the purple deeps:
<p/>While yet the expected tempest hangs on high, Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky, The mass of waters will no wind obey; Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.
<p/>While wavering counsels thus his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mind engage, Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage, To join the host, or to the general haste; Debating long, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fixes on the last:
<p/>Yet, as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) moves, the sight his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bosom warms, The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms, The gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly; Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.
<p/>By tardy steps ascending from the fleet: The king of men, Ulysses the divine, And who to Tydeus owes his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) noble line.-LRB-232-RRB-

<p/>Supported on the spears, they took their way, Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day. Nestor's approach alarm'd each Grecian breast, Whom thus the general of the host address'd:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O grace and glory of the Achaian name; What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame? Shall then proud Hector see his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) boast fulfill'd,

<p/>Is this a general's voice that calls to flight, While war hangs doubtful, while his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) soldiers fight? What more could Troy?
<p/>No more the troops -LRB-our hoisted sails in view, Themselves abandon'd-RRB- shall the fight pursue; But thy ships flying, with despair shall see; And owe destruction to a prince like thee.''

<p/>o'er yonder sands Soon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bands Fly diverse; while proud kings, and chiefs renown'd, Driven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around Of rolling dust, their winged wheels employ To hide their ignominious heads in Troy.

 (<font color='red'><b>the hero</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) spoke, then rush'd amid the warrior crew, And sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) voice before him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) flew, Loud, as the shout encountering armies yield When twice ten thousand shake the labouring field; Such was the voice, and such the thundering sound Of him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) whose trident rends the solid ground.
<p/>Meantime Saturnia from Olympus' brow, High-throned in gold, beheld the fields below; With joy the glorious conflict she (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) survey'd, Where her (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) great brother gave the Grecians aid.
<p/>Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fight, And grisly war appears a pleasing sight. But placed aloft, on Ida's shady height She (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) Jove, and trembles at the sight.
<p/>At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) trusts her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) power; resolved to prove The old, yet still successful, cheat of love; Against his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wisdom to oppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) charms, And lull the lord of thunders in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) arms.
<p/>Swift to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) bright apartment she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) repairs, Sacred to dress and beauty's pleasing cares: With skill divine had Vulcan form'd the bower,
<p/>Jove to deceive, what methods shall she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) try, What arts, to blind his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) all-beholding eye? Safe from access of each intruding power.
<p/>Here first she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) bathes; and round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) body pours Soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers: The winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey Through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way: Spirit divine!
<p/>Touch'd with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) secret key , the doors unfold: Self-closed, behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) shut the valves of gold. whose exhalation greets The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.
<p/>Thus while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) breathed of heaven, with decent pride Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) artful hands the radiant tresses tied; Part on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) head in shining ringlets roll'd, Part o'er her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) shoulders waved like melted gold.
<p/>Around her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) next a heavenly mantle flow'd, That rich with Pallas' labour'd colours glow'd: Large clasps of gold the foldings gather'd
<p/>round, A golden zone her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) swelling bosom bound. Far-beaming pendants tremble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) ear, Each gem illumined with a triple star.
<p/>Then o'er her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) head she (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) cast a veil more white Than new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light. Last her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) fair feet celestial sandals grace.

<p/>And flamy crocus made the mountain glow There golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair, Steep'd in soft joys and circumfused with air; Celestial dews, descending o'er the ground, Perfume the mount, and breathe ambrosia round: At length, with love and sleep's soft power oppress'd, The panting thunderer nods, and sinks to rest.
<p/>Now to the navy borne on silent wings, To Neptune's ear soft Sleep his (<font color='blue'><b>Celestial</b></font>) message brings; Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Celestial</b></font>) sudden, unperceived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Celestial</b></font>) stood, And thus with gentle words address'd the god:
<p/>``Now, Neptune! now, the important hour employ, To check a while the haughty hopes of Troy: While Jove yet rests, while yet my vapours shed The golden vision round his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sacred head; For Juno's love, and Somnus' pleasing ties, Have closed those awful and eternal eyes.
<p/>Neptune, with zeal increased, renews his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) care, And towering in the foremost ranks of war, Indignant thus--<div class="bookquote">``Oh once of martial fame!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Thus having said, the power of slumber flew, On human lids to drop the balmy dew. O Greeks! if yet ye can deserve the name!
<p/>This half-recover'd day shall Troy obtain? Shall Hector thunder at your ships again? Lo! still he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) vaunts, and threats the fleet with fires, While stern Achilles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) wrath retires.
<p/>One hero's loss too tamely you deplore, Be still yourselves, and ye shall need no more. Oh yet, if glory any bosom warms, Brace on your firmest helms, and stand to arms:
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brace</b></font>) strongest spear each valiant Grecian wield, Each valiant Grecian seize his (<font color='blue'><b>Brace</b></font>) broadest shield; Let to the weak the lighter arms belong, The ponderous targe be wielded by the strong.
<p/>Thus arm'd, not Hector shall our presence stay; Myself, ye Greeks! myself will lead the way.'' -LSB-Illustration: GREEK SHIELD.-RSB- GREEK SHIELD.
<p/>The troops assent; their martial arms they change: The busy chiefs their banded legions range. The kings, though wounded, and oppress'd with pain, With helpful hands themselves assist the train.
<p/>The strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wield, The weaker warrior takes a lighter shield. Thus sheath'd in shining brass, in bright array The legions march, and Neptune leads the way:
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) brandish'd falchion flames before their eyes, Like lightning flashing through the frighted skies. Clad in his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) might, the earth-shaking power appears; Pale mortals tremble, and confess their fears.
<p/>Troy's great defender stands alone unawed, Arms his (<font color='blue'><b>defender</b></font>) proud host, and dares oppose a god: And lo! the god, and wondrous man, appear: The sea's stern ruler there, and Hector here.
<p/>The roaring main, at her (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) great master's call, Rose in huge ranks, and form'd a watery wall Around the ships: seas hanging o'er the shores, Both armies join: earth thunders, ocean roars.
<p/>the bellowing deeps resound, When stormy winds disclose the dark profound; Less loud the winds that from the Ćolian hall Roar through the woods, and make whole forests fall; Less loud the woods, when flames in torrents pour, Catch the dry mountain, and its shades devour; With such a rage the meeting hosts are driven, And such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven.
<p/>The first bold javelin, urged by Hector's force, Direct at Ajax' bosom winged its course; But there no pass the crossing belts afford,
<p/>Not half so loud -LRB-One braced his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) shield, and one sustain'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sword.-RRB- Then back the disappointed Trojan drew, And cursed the lance that unavailing flew:
<p/>But `scaped not Ajax; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) tempestuous hand A ponderous stone upheaving from the sand, -LRB-Where heaps laid loose beneath the warrior's feet, Or served to ballast, or to prop the fleet,-RRB- Toss'd round and round, the missive marble flings; On the razed shield the fallen ruin rings, Full on his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) breast and throat with force descends; Nor deaden'd there its giddy fury spends, But whirling on, with many a fiery round, Smokes in the dust, and ploughs into the ground.
<p/>As when the bolt, red-hissing from above, Darts on the consecrated plant of Jove, The mountain-oak in flaming ruin lies, Black from the blow, and smokes of sulphur rise; Stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand, And own the terrors of the almighty hand!
<p/>So lies great Hector prostrate on the shore; His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) slacken'd hand deserts the lance it bore; His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) following shield the fallen chief o'erspread;
<p/>Beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) helmet dropp'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fainting head; His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) load of armour, sinking to the ground, Clanks on the field, a dead and hollow sound.
<p/>Loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain; Greece sees, in hope, Troy's great defender slain: All spring to seize him (<font color='blue'><b>defender</b></font>); storms of arrows fly, And thicker javelins intercept the sky.
<p/>In vain an iron tempest hisses round; He (<font color='blue'><b>defender</b></font>) lies protected, and without a wound.-LRB-238-RRB- Polydamas, Agenor the divine, The pious warrior of Anchises' line, And each bold leader of the Lycian band, With covering shields -LRB-a friendly circle-RRB- stand, His (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) mournful followers, with assistant care, The groaning hero to his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) chariot bear; His (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) foaming coursers, swifter than the wind, Speed to the town, and leave the war behind.
<p/>When now they touch'd the mead's enamell'd side, Where gentle Xanthus rolls his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) easy tide, With watery drops the chief they sprinkle round, Placed on the margin of the flowery ground.
<p/>Raised on his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) now ejects the gore; Now faints anew, low-sinking on the shore; By fits he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) breathes, half views the fleeting skies, And seals again, by fits, his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) swimming eyes.
<p/>Soon as the Greeks the chief's retreat beheld, With double fury each invades the field. Oilean Ajax first his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) javelin sped, Pierced by whose point the son of Enops bled;
<p/>-LRB-Satnius the brave, whom beauteous Neis bore Amidst her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) flocks on Satnio's silver shore;-RRB- Struck through the belly's rim, the warrior lies Supine, and shades eternal veil his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>An arduous battle rose around the dead; By turns the Greeks, by turns the Trojans bled. Fired with revenge, Polydamas drew near,
<p/>And at Prothoenor shook the trembling spear; The driving javelin through his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) shoulder thrust, He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) sinks to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
<p/>we rule the field, And thus their arms the race of Panthus wield: From this unerring hand there flies no dart
<p/>'' Lo thus -LRB-the victor cries-RRB- But bathes its point within a Grecian heart. Propp'd on that spear to which thou owest thy fall,
<p/>Go, guide thy darksome steps to Pluto's dreary hall. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) said, and sorrow touch'd each Argive breast: The soul of Ajax burn'd above the rest.
<p/>As by his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) side the groaning warrior fell, At the fierce foe he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) launch'd his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) piercing steel ; The foe, reclining, shunn'd the flying death; But fate, Archilochus, demands thy breath:
<p/>; Swift to perform heaven's fatal will, it fled Full on the juncture of the neck and head, And took the joint, and cut the nerves in twain: The dropping head first tumbled on the plain.
<p/>Thy lofty birth no succour could impart , The wings of death o'ertook thee on the dart So just the stroke, that yet the body stood Erect, then roll'd along the sands in blood.
<p/>'' Here, proud Polydamas, here turn thy eyes! -LRB-The towering Ajax loud-insulting cries:-RRB- Say, is this chief extended on the plain A worthy vengeance for Prothoenor slain?
<p/>Nor speak him (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) vulgar, nor of vulgar race; Some lines, methinks, may make his (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) lineage known, Antenor's brother, or perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) son.

<p/>Troy sadden'd at the view. But furious Acamas avenged his (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) cause ; As Promachus his (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) slaughtered brother draws, He (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>twain</b></font>) heart--<div class="bookquote">``Such fate attends you all, Proud Argives!

<p/>The boaster flies, and shuns superior force. Swift his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) broad falchion fierce Peneleus spread, And from the spouting shoulders struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) head;
<p/>To earth at once the head and helmet fly; The lance, yet sticking through the bleeding eye, The victor seized; and, as aloft he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) shook The gory visage, thus insulting spoke: <div class="bookquote">``Trojans!

''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dreadful he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) spoke, then toss'd the head on high; The Trojans hear, they tremble, and they fly:
<p/>Aghast they gaze around the fleet and wall, And dread the ruin that impends on all. Daughters of Jove! that on Olympus shine, Ye all-beholding, all-recording nine!
<p/>O say, when Neptune made proud Ilion yield, What chief, what hero first embrued the field? Of all the Grecians what immortal name, And whose bless'd trophies, will ye raise to fame?
<p/>Thou first, great Ajax! on the unsanguined plain Laid Hyrtius, leader of the Mysian train. Phalces and Mermer, Nestor's son o'erthrew, Bold Merion, Morys and Hippotion slew.
<p/>Strong Periphaetes and Prothoon bled, By Teucer's arrows mingled with the dead, Pierced in the flank by Menelaus' steel, His (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) people's pastor, Hyperenor fell; Eternal darkness wrapp'd the warrior round, And the fierce soul came rushing through the wound.
<p/>But stretch'd in heaps before Oileus' son, Fall mighty numbers, mighty numbers run; Ajax the less, of all the Grecian race Skill'd in pursuit, and swiftest in the chase.
<p/>Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector in a swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) is highly incensed at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) submissions; she (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) is then sent to Iris and Apollo.
<p/>Juno, repairing to the assembly of the gods, attempts, with extraordinary address, to incense them against Jupiter; in particular she (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) touches Mars with a violent resentment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) is ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva.
<p/>Iris and Apollo obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle, to which, after much reluctance and passion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) consents.
<p/>Apollo reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) back to the battle, marches before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) aegis, and turns the fortune of the fight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the Trojans rush in, and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are, as yet, repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.
<p/>-LSB-Illustration: BACCHUS.-RSB- BACCHUS. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE FIFTH BATTLE AT THE SHIPS; AND THE ACTS OF AJAX. Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound, And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:
<p/>Then stopp'd and panted, where the chariots lie Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye. Meanwhile, awaken'd from his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) dream of love, On Ida's summit sat imperial Jove:
<p/>Round the wide fields he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) cast a careful view, There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue; These proud in arms, those scatter'd o'er the plain
<p/>Not far, great Hector on the dust he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) spies, -LRB-His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sad associates round with weeping eyes,-RRB- Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,
<p/>And, `midst the war, the monarch of the main. His (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) senses wandering to the verge of death. The god beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) with a pitying look, And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno
<p/>spoke: <div class="bookquote">``O thou, still adverse to the eternal will, For ever studious in promoting ill! Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield, And driven his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) conquering squadrons from the field.
<p/>Canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand Our power immense, and brave the almighty hand? Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix'd on high,
<p/>From the vast concave of the spangled sky, I hung thee trembling in a golden chain, And all the raging gods opposed in vain?
<p/>Headlong I hurl'd them from the Olympian hall, Stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall. For godlike Hercules these deeds were done, Nor seem'd the vengeance worthy such a son:
<p/>When, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas toss'd The shipwreck'd hero on the Coan coast, Him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) through a thousand forms of death I bore, And sent to Argos, and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) native shore.
<p/>Hear this, remember, and our fury dread, Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head; Lest arts and blandishments successless prove, Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love.

<p/>If truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will To yon bright synod on the Olympian hill; Our high decree let various Iris know, And call the god that bears the silver bow.
<p/>but when we point the way. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) descend, and from the embattled plain Command the sea-god to his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) watery reign:
<p/>While Phoebus hastes great Hector to prepare To rise afresh, and once more wake the war: His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) labouring bosom re-inspires with breath, And calls his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) senses from the verge of death.
<p/>Greece chased by Troy, even to Achilles' fleet, Shall fall by thousands at the hero's feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), not untouch'd with pity, to

<p/>Vanquish'd at last by Hector's lance he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) lies. Then, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise: And lo! that instant, godlike Hector dies.
<p/>From that great hour the war's whole fortune turns, Pallas assists, and lofty Ilion burns. Not till that day shall Jove relax his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) rage,

<p/>As some wayfaring man, who wanders o'er In thought a length of lands So swift flew Juno to the bless'd abodes,
<p/>If thought of man can match the speed of gods. There sat the powers in awful synod placed; They bow'd, and made obeisance as she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) pass'd
<p/>Through all the brazen dome: with goblets crown'd-LRB-239-RRB- They hail her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) queen; the nectar streams around. Fair Themis first presents the golden bowl, And anxious asks what cares disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) soul?

<p/>Thoas with grief observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) dreadful course, Thoas, the bravest of the Ćtolian force; Skill'd to direct the javelin's distant flight, And bold to combat in the standing fight, Not more in councils famed for solid sense, Than winning words and heavenly eloquence.

<p/>Yet hear my counsel, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) worst withstand: The Greeks' main body to the fleet command; But let the few whom brisker spirits warm, Stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.
<p/>Thus point your arms; and when such foes appear, Fierce as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) is, let Hector learn to fear. '' The warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey, Thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.
<p/>Each Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command, The valiant leader of the Cretan band; And Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite, Approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.
<p/>Behind, unnumber'd multitudes attend, To flank the navy, and the shores defend. Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear, And Hector first came towering to the war.
<p/>Phoebus himself the rushing battle led; A veil of clouds involved his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) radiant head: High held before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), Jove's enormous shield Portentous shone, and shaded all the field;
<p/>Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign'd, To scatter hosts and terrify mankind, The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise From different parts, and mingle in the skies.
<p/>Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung, And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung; These drink the life of generous warriors slain: Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.
<p/>As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield, Sat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field; But when aloft he (<font color='blue'><b>warriors</b></font>) shakes it in the skies, Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes, Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast, Their force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.
<p/>scatter'd wide, No swain to guard them, and no day to guide, When two fell lions from the mountain come, And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.
<p/>So flies a herd of oxen, Impending Phoebus pours around them fear, And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear. Heaps fall on heaps: the slaughter Hector leads, First great Arcesilas, then Stichius bleeds;
<p/>One to the bold Boeotians ever dear, And one Menestheus' friend and famed compeer. Medon and Iasus, Ćneas sped; This sprang from Phelus, and the Athenians led; But hapless Medon from Oileus came;
<p/>A banish'd man, in Phylace he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dwell'd, Press'd by the vengeance of an angry wife; Troy ends at last his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) labours and his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) life.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) Ajax honour'd with a brother's name, Though born of lawless love: from home expell'd, Mecystes next Polydamas o'erthrew; And thee, brave Clonius, great Agenor slew.
<p/>By Paris, Deiochus inglorious dies, Pierced through the shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) basely flies. Polites' arm laid Echius on the plain; Stretch'd on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.
<p/>The Greeks dismay'd, confused, disperse or fall, Some seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall. While these fly trembling, others pant for breath,
<p/>On rush'd bold Hector, gloomy as the night; Forbids to plunder, animates the fight, Points to the fleet: <div class="bookquote">``For, by the gods!

<p/>The wondering crowds the downward level trod; Before them flamed the shield, and march'd the god. Then with his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) shook the mighty wall; And lo!
<p/>Easy as when ashore an infant stands, And draws imagined houses in the sands; The sportive wanton, pleased with some new play, Sweeps the slight works and fashion'd domes away: Thus vanish'd at thy touch, the towers and walls; The toil of thousands in a moment falls.
<p/>The Grecians gaze around with wild despair, Confused, and weary all the powers with prayer: Exhort their men, with praises, threats, commands; And urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.
<p/>the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall: Experienced Nestor chief obtests the skies, And weeps his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) country with a father's eyes. ''
<p/>thy shrine with offer'd gore; If e'er, in hope our country to behold, We paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;
<p/>O Jove! if ever, on his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) native shore, One Greek enrich'd If e'er thou sign`st our wishes with thy nod: Perform the promise of a gracious god!
<p/>This day preserve our navies from the flame, And save the relics of the Grecian name. '' Thus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consent, And peals of thunder shook the firmament.
<p/>As, when black tempests mix the seas and skies, The roaring deeps in watery mountains rise, Above the sides of some tall ship ascend, Its womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend: Thus loudly roaring, and o'erpowering all, Mount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall; Legions on legions from each side arise: Thick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.
<p/>Presumptuous Troy mistook the accepting sign, And catch'd new fury at the voice divine. Fierce on the ships above, the cars below, These wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.
<p/>While thus the thunder of the battle raged, And labouring armies round the works engaged, Still in the tent Patroclus sat to tend The good Eurypylus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Patroclus</b></font>) wounded friend.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Patroclus</b></font>) saw, ascending up the fleet, Victorious Troy; then, starting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Patroclus</b></font>) seat, With bitter groans his (<font color='blue'><b>Patroclus</b></font>) sorrows he (<font color='blue'><b>Patroclus</b></font>)

<p/>'' Though yet thy state require redress -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Patroclus</b></font>) cries-RRB- Depart I must: what horrors strike my eyes! Charged with Achilles' high command I go,
<p/>A mournful witness of this scene of woe ; I haste to urge him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) country's care To rise in arms, and shine again in war.
<p/>Perhaps some favouring god his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) soul may bend; The voice is powerful of a faithful friend. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) spoke; and, speaking, swifter than the wind Sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.
<p/>The embodied Greeks the fierce attack sustain, But strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain: Nor could the Trojans, through that firm array, Force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.
<p/>As when a shipwright, with Palladian art, Smooths the rough wood, and levels every part; With equal hand he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) guides his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) whole design,
<p/>By the just rule, and the directing line: The martial leaders, with like skill and care, Preserved their line, and equal kept the war.
<p/>At one proud bark, high-towering o'er the fleet, Ajax the great, and godlike Hector meet; For one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend, Nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend:
<p/>Brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried, And every ship sustained an equal tide. One kept the shore, and one the vessel trod; That fix'd as fate, this acted by a god.
<p/>The son of Clytius in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) daring hand, The deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand; But, pierced by Telamon's huge lance, expires: Thundering he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) falls, and drops the extinguish'd fires.
<p/>Great Hector view'd him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) with a sad survey, As stretch'd in dust before the stern he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) lay. '' Oh! all of Trojan, all of Lycian race!
<p/>Stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space: Lo! where the son of royal Clytius lies; Ah, save his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) arms, secure his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) obsequies!''
<p/>This said, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eager javelin sought the foe: But Ajax shunn'd the meditated blow. Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown; It stretch'd in dust
<p/>An exile long, sustain'd at Ajax' board, A faithful servant to a foreign lord; In peace, and war, for ever at his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) side, Near his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) loved master, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) died.

<p/>an honour'd name-RRB- Drove through the thickest of the embattled plains The startling steeds, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eager reins. As all on glory ran his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ardent mind, The pointed death arrests him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) from behind:
<p/>Hurl'd from the lofty seat, at distance far, The headlong coursers spurn his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) empty car; Till sad Polydamas the steeds restrain'd, And gave, Astynous, to thy careful hand; Then, fired to vengeance, rush'd amidst the foe:
<p/>Through his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) fair neck the thrilling arrow flies; In youth's first bloom reluctantly he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) dies. Rage edged his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) sword, and strengthen'd every blow.
<p/>Once more bold Teucer, in his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) country's cause, At Hector's breast a chosen arrow draws: And had the weapon found the destined way, Thy fall, great Trojan! had renown'd that day.
<p/>But Hector was not doom'd to perish then: The all-wise disposer of the fates of men -LRB-Imperial Jove-RRB- his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) present death withstands; Nor was such glory due to Teucer's hands.
<p/>At its full stretch as the tough string he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) drew, Struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two; Down dropp'd the bow: the shaft with brazen head Fell innocent,
<p/>Some god, propitious to the Trojan foe, Has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow, And broke the nerve my hands had twined with art, Strong to impel the flight of many a dart.''
<p/>``Since heaven commands it -LRB-Ajax made reply-RRB- Dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by: Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield, And quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.
<p/>and on the dust lay dead. The astonish'd archer to great Ajax cries; <div class="bookquote">``Some god prevents our destined enterprise: In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame, Thy brave example shall the rest inflame.

<p/>The sire of gods, confirming Thetis' prayer, The Grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair; But lifts to glory Troy's prevailing bands, Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.
<p/>Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove, Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove: On Ida's top he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) waits with longing eyes, To view the navy blazing to the skies;
<p/>These fates revolved in his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) almighty mind, He (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) raises Hector to the work design'd, Bids him (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) with more than mortal fury glow, And drives him (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>), like a lightning, on the foe.
<p/>Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn, The Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn. So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call, Shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) huge javelin, and whole armies fall.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) foams with wrath; beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) gloomy brow Like fiery meteors his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) red eye-balls glow: The radiant helmet on his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) temple burns, Waves when he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) nods, and lightens as he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) turns:
<p/>Not with more rage a conflagration rolls, Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles. For Jove his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) splendour round the chief had thrown, And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.
<p/>Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear: Yet Jove deferr'd the death he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) was to pay, And gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!
<p/>Now all on fire for fame, his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) breast, his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) eyes Burn at each foe, and single every prize; Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight, He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) points his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) ardour, and exerts his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) might.
<p/>Unhappy glories! for his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) fate was near, The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower, On all sides batter'd, yet resists his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) power:
<p/>By winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain, Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow, And sees the watery mountains break below.
<p/>Girt in surrounding flames, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) seems to fall Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all: Bursts as a wave
<p/>that from the cloud impends, And, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends; White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud Howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud: Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears; And instant death on every wave appears.
<p/>So some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,-LRB-241-RRB- So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet, The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.
<p/>As when a lion, rushing from his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) den, Amidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen, -LRB-Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed, At large expatiate o'er the ranker mead-RRB-
<p/>Leaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes; The trembling herdsman far to distance flies; Some lordly bull -LRB-the rest dispersed and fled-RRB-
<p/>Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew All Greece in heaps; but one he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) seized, and slew: Mycenian Periphes, a mighty name,
<p/>In wisdom great, in arms well known to fame; The minister of stern Eurystheus' ire Against Alcides, Copreus was his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) sire:
<p/>The son redeem'd the honours of the race, A son as generous as the sire was base; O'er all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) country's youth conspicuous far In every virtue, or of peace or war:
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) singles out; arrests, and lays him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dead. But doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield! Against the margin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) ample shield He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) hasty foot: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) heels up-sprung;
<p/>Supine he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fell; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) brazen helmet rung. On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd, And plunged the pointed javelin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) breast.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) circling friends, who strove to guard too late The unhappy hero, fled, or shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fate. Chased from the foremost line, the Grecian train Now man the next, receding toward the main
<p/>: Wedged in one body at the tents they stand, Wall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band. Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight; Now fear itself confines them to the fight:
<p/>Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most -LRB-The sage preserver of the Grecian host-RRB- Exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores; And by their parents, by themselves implores.
<p/>'' Oh friends! be men: your generous breasts inflame With mutual honour, and with mutual shame! Think of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care Your wives, your infants, and your parents share
<p/>: Think of each living father's reverend head; Think of each ancestor with glory dead; Absent, by me they speak, by me
<p/>they sue, They ask their safety, and their fame, from you: The gods their fates on this one action lay, And all are lost, if you desert the day.
<p/>The mist of darkness Jove around them threw She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) clear'd, restoring all the war to view; A sudden ray shot beaming o'er the plain, And show'd the shores, the navy, and the main: Hector they saw, and all who fly, or fight, The scene wide-opening to the blaze of light, First of the field great
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) spoke, and round him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) breathed heroic fires; Minerva seconds what the sage inspires. Ajax strikes their eyes, His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) port majestic, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) ample size: A ponderous mace with studs of iron crown'd,
<p/>Full twenty cubits long, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) swings around; Nor fights, like others, fix'd to certain stands But looks a moving tower above the bands; High on the decks with vast gigantic stride, The godlike hero stalks from side to side.
<p/>So when a horseman from the watery mead -LRB-Skill'd in the manage of the bounding steed-RRB- Drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,
<p/>To some great city through the public way; Safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) art, as side by side they run, He (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) shifts his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) seat, and vaults from one to one; And now to this, and now to that he (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) flies; Admiring numbers follow with their eyes.
<p/>As furious, Hector thunder'd threats aloud, And rush'd enraged before the Trojan crowd; Then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores Lay rank'd contiguous on the bending shores; So the strong eagle from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lay</b></font>) airy height, Who marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight, Stoops down impetuous, while they light for food, And, stooping, darkens with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stoops</b></font>) wings the flood.
<p/>From ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew, No less the wonder of the warring crew. Jove leads him (<font color='blue'><b>Stoops</b></font>) on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stoops</b></font>) almighty hand, And breathes fierce spirits in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stoops</b></font>) following band.
<p/>Thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire, No force could tame them, and no toil could tire; As if new vigour from new fights they won, And the long battle was but then begun.
<p/>The warring nations meet, the battle roars, Thick beats the combat on the sounding prores. Greece, yet unconquer'd, kept alive the war, Secure of death, confiding in despair:
<p/>the main Bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain: Like strength is felt from hope, and from despair, And each contends, as his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) were all the war.
<p/>Troy in proud hopes already view'd '' Twas thou, bold Hector! whose resistless hand First seized a ship on that contested strand;
<p/>The first that touch'd the unhappy Trojan shore: For this in arms the warring nations stood, And bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.
<p/>The same which dead Protesilaus bore,-LRB-242-RRB- No room to poise the lance or bend the bow; But hand to hand, and man to man, they grow:
<p/>The falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound, Swords flash in air, or glitter on the ground; With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed, And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
<p/>Wounded, they wound; and seek each other's hearts With falchions, axes, swords, and shorten'd darts. Still raging, Hector with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) ample hand Grasps the high stern, and gives this loud command:
<p/>-LSB-Illustration: AJAX DEFENDING THE GREEK SHIPS.-RSB- AJAX DEFENDING THE GREEK SHIPS. '' Haste, bring the flames! that toil of ten long years Is finished; and the day desired appears!
<p/>This happy day with acclamations greet, Bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet. The coward-counsels of a timorous throng Of reverend dotards check'd our glory long: Too long Jove lull'd
<p/>us with lethargic charms, But now in peals of thunder calls to arms: In this great day he (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) crowns our full desires, Wakes all our force, and seconds all our fires.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) spoke--the warriors at his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) fierce command Pour a new deluge on the Grecian band. Even Ajax paused, -LRB-so thick the javelins fly,-RRB- Stepp'd back, and doubted or to live or die.
<p/>Yet, where the oars are placed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stepp</b></font>) stands to wait What chief approaching dares attempt his (<font color='blue'><b>Stepp</b></font>) fate: Even to the last his (<font color='blue'><b>Stepp</b></font>) naval charge defends, Now shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Stepp</b></font>) spear, now lifts, and now protends; Even yet, the Greeks with piercing shouts inspires, Amidst attacks, and deaths, and darts, and fires.
<p/>'' O friends! O heroes! names for ever dear, Once sons of Mars, and thunderbolts of war! Ah! yet be mindful of your old renown, Your great forefathers' virtues and your own.
<p/>What aids expect you in this utmost strait? What bulwarks rising between you and fate? No aids, no bulwarks your retreat attend, No friends to help, no city to defend.
<p/>This spot is all you have, to lose or keep; There stand the Trojans, and here rolls the deep. ' Tis hostile ground you tread; your native lands Far, far from hence
<p/>: your fates are in your hands. '' Raging he (<font color='blue'><b>forefathers</b></font>) spoke; nor further wastes his (<font color='blue'><b>forefathers</b></font>) breath, But turns his (<font color='blue'><b>forefathers</b></font>) javelin to the work of death.
<p/>Whate'er bold Trojan arm'd his (<font color='blue'><b>forefathers</b></font>) daring hands, Against the sable ships, with flaming brands, So well the chief his (<font color='blue'><b>forefathers</b></font>) naval weapon sped, The luckless warrior at his (<font color='blue'><b>forefathers</b></font>) stern lay dead:
<p/>Full twelve, the boldest, in a moment fell, Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell. -LSB-Illustration: CASTOR AND POLLUX.-RSB-
<p/>ARGUMENT THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS Patroclus -LRB-in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book-RRB- entreats Achilles to suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) to go to the assistance of the Greeks with Achilles' troops and armour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) agrees to it, but at the same time charges him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further pursuit of the enemy.
<p/>CASTOR AND POLLUX. BOOK XVI. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) friend, after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle.
<p/>The Trojans, at the sight of Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) for that hero, are cast into the uttermost consternation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) beats them off from the vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was averse to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fate.
<p/>Several other particulars of the battle are described; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of Achilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses and disarms him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>), Euphorbus wounds him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>), and Hector kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), which concludes the book.
<p/>Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies; The streaming tears fall copious from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) eyes Not faster, trickling to the plains below, From the tall rock the sable waters flow.
<p/>So warr'd both armies on the ensanguined shore, While the black vessels smoked with human gore. Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.
<p/>Thus spoke, indulgent, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) best beloved:-LRB-243-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears, That flows so fast in these unmanly tears?
<p/>No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps From her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved breast, with fonder passion weeps; Not more the mother's soul, that infant warms, Clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knees, and reaching at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms, Than thou hast mine!
<p/>Oh tell me, to what end Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Griev`st thou for me, or for, my martial band?
<p/>Our fathers live -LRB-our first, most tender care-RRB-, Thy good Menoetius breathes the vital air, And hoary Peleus yet extends his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) days; Pleased in their age to hear their children's praise.

<p/>Or come sad tidings from our native land? Or may some meaner cause thy pity claim? Whate'er the cause, reveal thy secret care, And speak those sorrows which a friend would share.
<p/>A sigh that instant from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bosom broke, Another follow'd, and Patroclus spoke: <div class="bookquote">``Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast, Thyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best!

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Patroclus</b></font>)</div>Lo! Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease, Thy breast alone no lenitives appease. May never rage like thine my soul enslave, O great in vain! unprofitably brave!

<p/>ever amorous hero caused thy birth, Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth: Some rugged rock's hard entrails gave thee form, And raging seas produced thee in a storm, A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind, So rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.
<p/>If some dire oracle thy breast alarm, If aught from Jove, or Thetis, stop thy arm, Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine, If I but lead the Myrmidonian line:
<p/>Clad in thy dreadful arms if I appear, Proud Troy shall tremble, and desert the war; Without thy person Greece shall win the day, And thy mere image chase her (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) foes away.

<p/>Achilles knows no fears; Nor words from Jove nor oracles he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) hears; Nor aught a mother's caution can suggest; The tyrant's pride lies rooted in my breast.
<p/>My wrongs, my wrongs, my constant thought engage, Those, my sole oracles, inspire my rage: I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) tyrant: gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) power to wrong

<p/>Tis time our fury should relent at last: I fix'd its date; the day I wish'd appears: How Hector to my ships his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) battle bears,
<p/>But bear we this--the wrongs I grieve are past; ' The flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears. Go then, Patroclus!

<p/>See the thin relics of their baffled band At the last edge of yon deserted land! Behold all Ilion on their ships descends; How the cloud blackens, how the storm impends!
<p/>It was not thus, when, at my sight amazed, Troy saw and trembled, as this helmet blazed: Had not the injurious king our friendship lost, Yon ample trench had buried half her (<font color='blue'><b>Myrmidons</b></font>) host.
<p/>No camps, no bulwarks now the Trojans fear, Those are not dreadful, no Achilles there; No longer flames the lance of Tydeus' son; No more your general calls his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heroes on: Hector, alone, I hear;

<p/>But heed my words, and mark a friend's command, Though Jove in thunder should command the war, Be just, consult my glory, and forbear.
<p/>The fleet once saved, desist from further chase, Nor lead to Ilion's walls the Grecian race; Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy; Some god, like Phoebus, ever kind to Troy.
<p/>Let Greece, redeem'd from this destructive strait, Do her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) own work; and leave the rest to fate. O! would to all the immortal powers above, Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove!

<p/>Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand Great Jove with conquest crown'd the Trojan band. Ajax no more Spent and o'erpower'd, he (<font color='blue'><b>almighty</b></font>) barely breathes at most;
<p/>Yet scarce an army stirs him (<font color='blue'><b>almighty</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>almighty</b></font>) post; Dangers on dangers all around him (<font color='blue'><b>almighty</b></font>) glow, And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.
<p/>Stern Hector waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sword, and standing near, Where furious Ajax plied his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) ashen spear, Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped, That the broad falchion lopp'd its brazen head; His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain; The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.
<p/>Say, Muses, throned above the starry frame, How first the navy blazed with Trojan flame? Great Ajax saw, and own'd the hand divine; Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign, Warn'd he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) retreats.

<p/>In the rich belt, as in a starry zone: Achilles' shield his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) ample shoulders spread, Achilles' helmet nodded o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) head:

<p/>Who, like in strength, in swiftness, and in grace, A mortal courser match'd the immortal race. Achilles speeds from tent to tent, and warms His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) hardy Myrmidons to blood and arms.
<p/>All breathing death, around the chief they stand, A grim, terrific, formidable band: Grim as voracious wolves, that seek the springs-LRB-244-RRB-
<p/>When scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings; When some tall stag, fresh-slaughtered in the wood, Has drench'd their wide insatiate throats with blood, To the black fount they rush, a hideous throng, With paunch distended, and with lolling tongue, Fire fills their eye, their black jaws belch the gore, And gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more.
<p/>Like furious, rush'd the Myrmidonian crew, Such their dread strength, and such their deathful view. High in the midst the great Achilles stands, Directs their order, and the war commands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>), loved of Jove, had launch'd for Ilion's shores Full fifty vessels, mann'd with fifty oars: Five chosen leaders the fierce bands obey, Himself supreme in valour, as in sway.
<p/>First march'd Menestheus, of celestial birth, Derived from thee, whose waters wash the earth, Divine Sperchius! Jove-descended flood! A mortal mother mixing with a god.
<p/>Such was Menestheus, but miscall'd by fame The son of Borus, that espoused the dame. Eudorus next; whom Polymele the gay, Famed in the graceful dance, produced to-day.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), sly Cellenius loved: on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would gaze, As with swift step she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) form'd the running maze: To her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) high chamber from Diana's quire, The god pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), urged, and crown'd his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fire.
<p/>Strong Echecleus, bless'd in all those charms That pleased a god, succeeded to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms; Not conscious of those loves, long hid from fame, With gifts of price he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sought and won the dame; Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) secret offspring to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sire she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bare; Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sire caress'd him (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) with a parent's care.
<p/>Pisander follow'd; matchless in his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) art To wing the spear, or aim the distant dart; No hand so sure of all the Emathian line, Or if a surer, great Patroclus!

<p/>Soon as Achilles with superior care Had call'd the chiefs, and order'd all the war, This stern remembrance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) troops he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) gave: <div class="bookquote">``Ye far-famed Myrmidons, ye fierce and brave!

<p/>-LSB-Illustration: DIANA.-RSB- DIANA. From thence he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) took a bowl, of antique frame, Which never man had stained with ruddy wine, Nor raised in offerings to the power divine,
<p/>But Peleus' son; and Peleus' son to none Had raised in offerings, but to Jove alone. This tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame, He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) purged; and wash'd it in the running stream.
<p/>Then cleansed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hands; and fixing for a space His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes on heaven, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) feet upon the place Of sacrifice, the purple draught he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) pour'd
<p/>Forth in the midst; and thus the god implored: <div class="bookquote">``O thou supreme! high-throned all height above! O great Pelasgic, Dodonaean Jove!
<p/>Their feet unwash'd, their slumbers on the ground; Who hear, from rustling oaks, thy dark decrees; And catch the fates, low-whispered in the breeze;-RRB-
<p/>Who `midst surrounding frosts, and vapours chill, Presid`st on bleak Dodona's vocal hill: -LRB-Whose groves the Selli, race austere! surround, Hear, as of old!
<p/>Lo, to the dangers of the fighting field The best, the dearest of my friends, I yield, Though still determined, to my ships confined; Patroclus gone, I stay but half behind.
<p/>Oh! be his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodona</b></font>) guard thy providential care, Confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodona</b></font>) heart, and string his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodona</b></font>) arm to war: Press'd by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dodona</b></font>) single force let Hector see His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fame in arms not owing all to me.
<p/>But when the fleets are saved from foes and fire, Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) with conquest and renown retire; Preserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) arms, preserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) social train, And safe return him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) to these eyes again!
<p/>Great Jove consents to half the chief's request, But heaven's eternal doom denies the rest; To free the fleet was granted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) prayer; His (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) safe return, the winds dispersed in air.
<p/>Thou gav`st, at Thetis' prayer, Glory to me, and to the Greeks despair. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the god</b></font>)</div>Back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) tent the stern Achilles flies, And waits the combat with impatient eyes.
<p/>As wasps, provoked by children in their play, Pour from their mansions by the broad highway, In swarms the guiltless traveller engage, Whet all their stings, and call forth all their rage:
<p/>Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus' care, Invade the Trojans, and commence the war. All rise in arms, and, with a general cry,
<p/>Assert their waxen domes, and buzzing progeny. Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms, So loud their clamours, and so keen their arms:
<p/>Be mindful of your deeds in ancient days; Your godlike master let your acts proclaim, And add new glories to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mighty name.
<p/>Their rising rage Patroclus' breath inspires, Who thus inflames them with heroic fires: <div class="bookquote">``O warriors, partners of Achilles' praise! Think your Achilles sees you fight: be brave, And humble the proud monarch whom you save.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Patroclus</b></font>)</div>Joyful they heard, and kindling as he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) spoke, Flew to the fleet, involved in fire and smoke. From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound, The hollow ships return a deeper sound.
<p/>The war stood still, and all around them gazed, When great Achilles' shining armour blazed: Troy saw, and thought the dread Achilles nigh, At once they see, they tremble, and they fly.
<p/>Close to the stern of that famed ship which bore Unbless'd Protesilaus to Ilion's shore, The great Paeonian, bold Pyrechmes stood; -LRB-Who led his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) bands from Axius' winding flood;-RRB- His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound; The groaning warrior pants upon the ground.
<p/>Then first thy spear, divine Patroclus! flew, Where the war raged, and where the tumult grew. His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) troops, that see their country's glory slain, Fly diverse, scatter'd o'er the distant plain.
<p/>Patroclus' arm forbids the spreading fires, And from the half-burn'd ship proud Troy retires; Clear'd from the smoke the joyful navy lies; In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies; Triumphant Greece her (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) rescued decks ascends, And loud acclaim the starry region rends.
<p/>So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain's head, O'er heaven's expanse like one black ceiling spread; Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray, Bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day: The hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise, And streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes; The smiling scene wide opens to the sight, And all the unmeasured ether flames with light.
<p/>But Troy repulsed, and scatter'd o'er the plains, Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains. Now every Greek some hostile hero slew, But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew:
<p/>Sharp in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) thigh he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) felt the piercing wound; The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown, The thigh transfix'd, and broke the brittle bone: Headlong he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) fell.
<p/>As Areilycus had turn'd him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) round, Next, Thoas was thy chance; Thy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lance. Phylides' dart -LRB-as Amphidus drew nigh-RRB-
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) blow prevented, and transpierced his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) thigh, Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away; In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.
<p/>In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand, And two bold brothers of the Lycian band: By great Antilochus, Atymnius dies, Pierced in the flank, lamented youth!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) lies, Kind Maris, bleeding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) brother's wound, Defends the breathless carcase on the ground; Furious he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) flies, his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) murderer to engage:
<p/>But godlike Thrasimed prevents his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) rage, Between his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) arm and shoulder aims a blow; His (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) arm falls spouting on the dust below: He (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) sinks, with endless darkness cover'd o'er: And vents his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) soul, effused with gushing gore.
<p/>Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed, Sarpedon's friends, Amisodarus' seed; Amisodarus, who, by Furies led, The bane of men,
<p/>abhorr'd Chimaera bred; Skill'd in the dart in vain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) sons expire, And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire. Stopp'd
<p/>in the tumult Cleobulus lies, Beneath Oileus' arm, a living prize; A living prize not long the Trojan stood; The thirsty falchion drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) reeking blood:
<p/>Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame, Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came; In vain their javelins at each other flew, Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.
<p/>Plunged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) throat the smoking weapon lies; Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) eyes. On the plumed crest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) Boeotian foe
<p/>The daring Lycon aim'd a noble blow; The sword broke short; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>), Peneleus sped Full on the juncture of the neck and head:
<p/>O'ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds, Pierced through the shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) mounts his (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) steeds; Back from the car he (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) tumbles to the ground: His (<font color='blue'><b>Maris</b></font>) swimming eyes eternal shades surround.
<p/>The head, divided by a stroke so just, Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust. Next Erymas was doom'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) fate to feel, His (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) open'd mouth received the Cretan steel:
<p/>Beneath the brain the point a passage tore, Crash'd the thin bones, and drown'd the teeth in gore: His (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) mouth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) nostrils, pour a flood; He (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) sobs his (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) soul out in the gush of blood.
<p/>As when the flocks neglected by the swain, Or kids, or lambs, lie scatter'd o'er the plain, A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey, And rend the trembling, unresisting prey:
<p/>Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came; Troy fled, unmindful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hung</b></font>) former fame. But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim'd, Still, pointed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) breast, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) javelin flamed.
<p/>The Trojan chief, experienced in the field, O'er his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) broad shoulders spread the massy shield, Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour,
<p/>And on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) buckler caught the ringing shower: He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise, Yet stops, and turns, and saves his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) loved allies.
<p/>As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms, And rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms, Dark o'er the fields the ascending vapour flies, And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies: So from the ships, along the dusky plain, Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.
<p/>The fiery coursers forced their lord away: While far behind his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) Trojans fall confused; Wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised: Chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes Shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.
<p/>Even Hector fled; through heads of disarray In vain they labour up the steepy mound; Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.
<p/>Fierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies; Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies; Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight; Clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch'd from sight.
<p/>Loud o'er the rout was heard the victor's cry, Where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die, Where horse and arms, and chariots he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) o'erthrown, And bleeding heroes under axles groan.
<p/>The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down, Scour o'er the fields, and stretch to reach the town. No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew: From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.
<p/>High-bounding o'er the fosse, the whirling car Smokes through the ranks, o'ertakes the flying war, And thunders after Hector; Hector flies, Patroclus shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) lance; but fate denies.
<p/>Not with less noise, with less impetuous force, The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course, Than when in autumn Jove his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fury pours, And earth is loaden with incessant showers; -LRB-When guilty mortals break the eternal laws, Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;-RRB-
<p/>From their deep beds he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) bids the rivers rise, And opens all the flood-gates of the skies: The impetuous torrents from their hills obey, Whole fields are drown'd, and mountains swept away; Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main; And trembling man sees all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) labours vain!
<p/>And now the chief -LRB-the foremost troops repell'd-RRB- Back to the ships his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) destined progress held, Bore down half Troy in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) resistless way, And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.
<p/>Between the space where silver Simois flows, Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose, All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands, And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.
<p/>Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear, And fell the victim of his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) coward fear; Shrunk up he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) sat, with wild and haggard eye, Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;
<p/>First Pronous died beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) fiery dart, Which pierced below the shield his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) valiant heart. Patroclus mark'd him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) shunn'd the war, And with unmanly tremblings shook the car, And dropp'd the flowing reins.
<p/>As on a rock that overhangs the main, An angler, studious of the line and cane, Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore: Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook, He (<font color='blue'><b>angler</b></font>) fell, and life his (<font color='blue'><b>angler</b></font>) heartless breast forsook.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>angler</b></font>) `twixt the jaws, The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws. Next on Eryalus he (<font color='blue'><b>angler</b></font>) flies; a stone, Large as a rock, was by his (<font color='blue'><b>angler</b></font>) fury thrown:
<p/>Full on his (<font color='blue'><b>angler</b></font>) crown the ponderous fragment flew, And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two: Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell, And death involved him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) with the shades of hell.
<p/>Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie; Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die; Amphoterus and Erymas succeed; And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.
<p/>Where'er he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) moves, the growing slaughters spread In heaps on heaps a monument of dead. When now Sarpedon his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) brave friends beheld Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,
<p/>With this reproach his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) flying host he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) warms: <div class="bookquote">``Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms! Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain; This hand unaided shall the war sustain:
<p/>The task be mine this hero's strength to try, Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car: Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.
<p/>As when two vultures on the mountain's height Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight; They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;
<p/>The desert echoes, and the rocks reply: The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage With equal clamours, and with equal rage.
<p/>Jove view'd the combat: whose event foreseen, He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) thus bespoke his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) sister and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) queen: <div class="bookquote">``The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,-LRB-245-RRB-
<p/>My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain: Already on the verge of death he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) stands, His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) life is owed to fierce Patroclus' hands,
<p/>Say, shall I snatch him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) from impending fate, And send him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) safe to Lycia, distant far From all the dangers and the toils of war; Or to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) doom my bravest offspring yield, And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?''
 (<font color='red'><b>queen</b></font>)</div><p/>What passions in a parent's breast debate! Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes: <div class="bookquote">``What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!
<p/>Short is the date prescribed to mortal man; Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span, Whose bounds were fix'd before his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) race began?
<p/>How many sons of gods, foredoom'd to death, Before proud Ilion must resign their breath! Were thine exempt, debate would rise above, And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.
<p/>Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight; And when the ascending soul has wing'd her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) flight, Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) friends and people, to his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) future praise, A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise, And lasting honours to his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) ashes give; His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fame -LRB-'tis all the dead can have-RRB- shall live.
<p/>The breathless body to his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) native land. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the goddess these</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) said: the cloud-compeller, overcome, Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom. Then touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd
<p/>The god, his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) eyes averting from the plain, Laments his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) son, predestined to be slain, Far from the Lycian shores, his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) happy native reign.
<p/>Now met in arms, the combatants appear; Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear; From strong Patroclus' hand the javelin fled, And pass'd the groin of valiant Thrasymed; The nerves unbraced no more his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) bulk sustain, He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.
<p/>The first aloof with erring fury flew, The next transpierced Achilles' mortal steed, The generous Pedasus of Theban breed: Fix'd in the shoulder's joint, he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) reel'd around, Roll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sudden fall the entangled harness broke; Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook: When bold Automedon, to disengage The starting coursers, and restrain their rage, Divides the traces with his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sword, and freed The encumbered chariot from the dying steed: The rest move on, obedient to the rein: The car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.
<p/>The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance: And first Sarpedon whirl'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) weighty lance, Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course, And spent in empty air its dying force.
<p/>A shower of blood o'er all the fatal field: Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw: Not so Patroclus' never-erring dart; Aim'd
<p/>at his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) breast it pierced a mortal part, Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart. Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall, Or pine -LRB-fit mast for some great admiral-RRB-
<p/>Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground, Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,
<p/>Before his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) chariot stretch'd his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) form divine: He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore, And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.
<p/>So lies a bull beneath the lion's paws, While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood; Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.
<p/>The dying chief address'd his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) last command; <div class="bookquote">``Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare The glorious dangers of destructive war, To lead my troops, to combat at their head, Incite the living, and supply the dead.
<p/>Then to the leader of the Lycian band Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon's death.
<p/>Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight; Defend my body, conquer in my right: That, taught by great examples, all may try Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die.
<p/>What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo, If these spoil'd arms adorn a Grecian foe! ''  (<font color='red'><b>chief</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) ceased; the Fates suppress'd
<p/>The prostrate prince, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) bosom trod; Then drew the weapon from his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) panting heart, The reeking fibres clinging to the dart; From the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood, And the soul issued in the purple flood.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) labouring breath, And his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) eyes darken'd with the shades of death.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) painful arm, yet useless with the smart Inflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart, Supported on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) better hand he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stay'd:

<p/>First to the fight his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) native troops he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) warms, Then loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms; With ample strides he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) stalks from place to place;
<p/>Renew'd by art divine, the hero stands, And owns the assistance of immortal hands. Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas: Ćneas next, and Hector he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) accosts; Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.
<p/>'' What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ? Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy! Those generous friends, who, from their country far, Breathe their brave souls out in another's war.
<p/>In action valiant, and in council wise, Who guarded right, and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) people free; To all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) Lycians lost, and lost to thee!
<p/>See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies, Stretch'd by Patroclus' arm on yonder plains, O save from hostile rage his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) loved remains!
<p/>Ah let not Greece his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) conquer'd trophies boast, Nor on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) corse revenge her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) heroes lost!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) spoke: each leader in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) grief partook: Troy, at the loss, through all her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) legions shook.
<p/>At once his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) country's pillar, and their own; A chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall A host of heroes, and outshined them all.
<p/>Transfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes, And with superior vengeance greatly glows.
<p/>But o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands, And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands: <div class="bookquote">``Heroes, be men; be what you were before; Or weigh the great occasion, and be more.
<p/>The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield, Lies pale in death, extended on the field. To guard his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) body Troy in numbers flies; Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.
<p/>The heroes kindle at his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fierce command; The martial squadrons close on either hand: Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms, Thessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.
<p/>Haste, strip his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) arms, the slaughter round him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) spread, And send the living Lycians to the dead. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the bands</b></font>)</div>With horrid shouts they circle round the slain; The clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.
<p/>Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight, O'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night, And round his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) son confounds the warring hosts, His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.
<p/>Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls; Agacleus' son, from Budium's lofty walls; Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame; Now sent to Troy, Achilles' arms to aid, He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) pays due vengeance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) kinsman's shade.
<p/>Soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) luckless hand had touch'd the dead, A rock's large fragment thunder'd on his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) head; Hurl'd by Hectorean force it cleft in twain
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) o'er the slain. Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came, And, like an eagle darting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) game,
<p/>What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand, O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown, At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone, Which sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) to the dead: when Troy, too near That arm, drew back; and Hector learn'd to fear.
<p/>Far as an able hand a lance can throw, Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe; So far the Trojans from their lines retired; Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.
<p/>Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band. Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) rage, The only hope of Chalcon's trembling age; Wide o'er the land was stretch'd
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) large domain, With stately seats, and riches blest in vain: Him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>), bold with youth, and eager to pursue The flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;
<p/>The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain; With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain, And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose; An iron circle round the carcase grows.
<p/>Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound, He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) fell, and falling made the fields resound. Then brave Laogonus resign'd his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) breath, Despatch'd by Merion to the shades of death
<p/>: On Ida's holy hill he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) made abode, The priest of Jove, and honour'd like his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) god. Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;

<p/>The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) spear Aeneas at the victor threw, '' Swift as thou art -LRB-the raging hero cries-RRB-

<p/>Then, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled, And left their monarch with the common dead: Around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall Of carnage rises, as the heroes fall.
<p/>Nor unattended see the shades below. -LRB-So Jove decreed!-RRB- At length the Greeks obtain The prize contested, and despoil the slain.

<p/>Apollo bows, and from mount Ida's height, Swift to the field precipitates his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) flight; Thence from the war the breathless hero bore, Veil'd in a cloud, to silver Simois' shore; There bathed his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) honourable wounds, and dress'd His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) manly members in the immortal vest; And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews Restores his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) freshness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) form renews.
<p/>Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race, Of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace, Received Sarpedon, at the god's command,
<p/>And in a moment reach'd the Lycian land; The corse amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) weeping friends they laid, Where endless honours wait the sacred shade.

<p/>Who last beneath thy vengeance press'd the plain; When heaven itself thy fatal fury led, And call'd to fill the number of the dead?
<p/>, Vain was thy friend's command, thy courage vain. Who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain, Adrestus first; Autonous then succeeds; Echeclus follows; next young Megas bleeds, Epistor, Melanippus, bite the ground;
<p/>Now Troy had stoop'd beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) matchless power, But flaming Phoebus kept the sacred tower Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;-LRB-246-RRB-
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook; He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud, A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.
<p/>The slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown'd: Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night; The rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Patroclus</b></font>)</div><p/>Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall; Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand
<p/>, Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand. '' So spoke the god who darts celestial fires; The Greek obeys him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), and with awe retires.
<p/>While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) panting coursers, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) breast debates, Or in the field his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) forces to employ, Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.
<p/>Thus while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) thought, beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) Phoebus stood, In Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood; -LRB-Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung, A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;-RRB-
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) accosts him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>). '' What a shameful sight! God! is it Hector that forbears the fight? Were thine my vigour
<p/>this successful spear Should soon convince thee of so false a fear. Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame, And in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame.
<p/>Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed, And heaven ordains him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) by thy lance to bleed. '' So spoke the inspiring god; then took his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) flight, And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) bids Cebrion drive the rapid car; The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war. The god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd, And pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.
<p/>Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight; A spear his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) left, a stone employs his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) right: With all his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) nerves he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) drives it at the foe.
<p/>Pointed above, and rough and gross below: The falling ruin crush'd Cebrion's head, The lawless offspring of king Priam's bed; His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound
<p/>: The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground. The charioteer, while yet he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) held the rein, Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.
<p/>To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides, While the proud victor thus his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) fall derides. '' Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!
<p/>What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes! Mark with what ease they sink into the sand! Pity that all their practice is by land!''
<p/>Then rushing sudden on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) prostrate prize, To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies: Swift as a lion, terrible and bold
<p/>, That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold; Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain, And from his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) fatal courage finds his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) bane.
<p/>Thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage, Two lordly rulers of the wood engage; Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades, And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.
<p/>Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head, And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead: While all around, confusion, rage, and fright, Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.
<p/>At once bold Hector leaping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) car, Defends the body, and provokes the war. So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud
<p/>In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood; Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown, The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan; This way and that, the rattling thicket bends, And the whole forest in one crash descends.
<p/>on darts, now round the carcase ring; Now flights of arrows bounding from the string: Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields, Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.
<p/>Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage, In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage. Darts shower'd But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains, Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains, And,
<p/>Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven His (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) fervid orb through half the vault of heaven; While on each host with equal tempests fell The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.
<p/>stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins! But when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) evening wheels o'erhung the main, Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.
<p/>Then from amidst the tumult and alarms, They draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms. Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows, And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.
<p/>Thrice on the press like Mars himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) flew, And thrice three heroes at each onset slew. There ends thy glory!
<p/>there the Fates untwine The last, black remnant of so bright a line: Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way; Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!
<p/>For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined, Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind. The weighty shock his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) neck and shoulders feel; His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) eyes flash sparkles, his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) stunn'd senses reel
<p/>In giddy darkness; far to distance flung, His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) bounding helmet on the champaign rung. Achilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore;
<p/>That plume which never stoop'd to earth before; Long used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine, And shade the temples of the mad divine.
<p/>Jove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod; Not long--for fate pursues him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), and the god. His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) spear in shivers falls; his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) ample shield Drops from his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) arm: his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) baldric strows the field:
<p/>Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes; Stupid he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) stares, and all-assistless stands: Such is the force of more than mortal hands!
<p/>The corslet his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) astonish'd breast forsakes: A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame, From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) name;
<p/>Famed for the manage of the foaming horse, Skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course: Full twenty knights he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) tumbled from the car,
<p/>While yet he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) learn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) rudiments of war. His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) venturous spear first drew the hero's gore; He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) struck, he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) wounded, but he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) durst no more.
<p/>Nor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood: But swift withdrew the long-protended wood. And turn'd him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) short, and herded in the crowd.
<p/>Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear, Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear, Retires for succour to his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) social train, And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.
<p/>Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) views, Breaks through the ranks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) retreat pursues: The lance arrests him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) with a mortal wound; He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) falls, earth thunders, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) arms resound.
<p/>So, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score, The roaming lion meets a bristly boar, Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood, With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood; At length the sovereign savage wins the strife; And the torn boar resigns his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) thirst and life.
<p/>With him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) all Greece was sunk; that moment all Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall. Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown, So many lives effused, expires his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) own.
<p/>As dying now at Hector's feet he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) lies, He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sternly views him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), and triumphant cries: <div class="bookquote">``Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy; The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames, And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.

<p/>Though much at parting that great chief might say, And much enjoin thee, this important day. ' Return not, my brave friend -LRB-perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said-RRB-, Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.'

<p/>But swift Automedon with loosen'd reins Rapt in the chariot o'er the distant plains, Far from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) rage the immortal coursers drove; The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.

<p/>Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) body from the enemy: Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) off.
<p/>This, Glaucus objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) had won from Patroclus, and renews the battle.
<p/>The Greeks give way, till Ajax rallies them: Aeneas sustains the Trojans. Aeneas and Hector Attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon.
<p/>The horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) body with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion.
<p/>Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus' death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.
<p/>The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies in the fields before Troy. On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,
<p/>Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead. Great Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe, Springs to the front, and guards him (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) from the foe.
<p/>Thus round her (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) new-fallen young the heifer moves, Fruit of her (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) throes, and first-born of her (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) loves; And anxious -LRB-helpless as he (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) lies, and bare-RRB-
<p/>Turns, and re-turns her (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>), with a mother's care, Opposed to each that near the carcase came, His (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) broad shield glimmers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) lances flame.
<p/>The son of Panthus, skill'd the dart to send, Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend. '' This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low; Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:
<p/>To me the spoils my prowess won, resign: Depart with life, and leave the glory mine '' The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn'd
<p/>With generous anguish, and in scorn return'd: '' Laugh`st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne, When mortals boast of prowess not their own?
<p/>Not thus the lion glories in his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) might, Nor panther braves his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) spotted foe in fight, Nor thus the boar -LRB-those terrors of the plain;-RRB- Man only vaunts his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) force, and vaunts in vain.
<p/>But far the vainest of the boastful kind, These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind. Yet 'twas but late, beneath my conquering steel

<p/>These eyes beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) on the dust expire, No more to cheer his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spouse, or glad his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sire. Presumptuous youth! like his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) shall be thy doom, Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;
<p/>Or, while thou may`st, avoid the threaten'd fate; Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late. '' Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: <div class="bookquote">``That action known, Come, for my brother's blood repay thy own.

<p/>Meanwhile great Ajax -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) broad shield display'd-RRB- Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade; And now before, and now behind he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stood:
<p/>Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood, With many a step, the lioness surrounds Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) tawny young, beset by men and hounds; Elate her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) heart, and rousing all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) powers, Dark o'er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.
<p/>But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids, On Hector frowning, thus his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) flight upbraids: ``Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?
<p/>Fast by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) side the generous Spartan glows With great revenge, and feeds his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) inward woes. A manly form, without a manly mind.
<p/>Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ What other methods may preserve thy Troy: 'Tis time to try if Ilion's state can stand By thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:
<p/>Is this, O chief! a hero's boasted fame? How vain, without the merit, is the name! Mean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake Their lives for you?
<p/>those Lycians you forsake? What from thy thankless arms can we expect? Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect; Say, shall our slaughter'd bodies guard your walls,
<p/>While unreveng'd the great Sarpedon falls? Even where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) died for Troy, you left him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) there, A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.
<p/>Did such a spirit as the gods impart Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart, -LRB-Such as should burn in every soul that draws The sword for glory, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) country's cause-RRB-
<p/>On my command if any Lycian wait, Hence let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) march, and give up Troy to fate. Even yet our mutual arms we might employ, And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.
<p/>Oh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain Sarpedon's arms and honour'd corse again! Greece with Achilles' friend should be repaid, And thus due honours purchased to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shade.
<p/>But words are vain-- Let Ajax once appear, And Hector trembles and recedes with fear; Thou dar`st not meet the terrors of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) eye;
<p/>The Trojan chief with fix'd resentment eyed The Lycian leader, and sedate replied: <div class="bookquote">``Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector's ear From such a warrior such a speech should hear?
<p/>And lo! already thou prepar`st to fly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The leader</b></font>)</div>I deem'd thee once the wisest of thy kind, But ill this insult suits a prudent mind.
<p/>I shun great Ajax? I desert my train? ' Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain ; I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds, And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.
<p/>But Jove's high will is ever uncontroll'd, The strong he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) withers, and confounds the bold; Now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now Strikes the fresh garland from the victor's brow!
<p/>Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way, And thou be witness, if I fear to-day; If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread, Or yet their hero dare defend the dead.
<p/>'' Then turning to the martial hosts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) cries: <div class="bookquote">``Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies! Be men, my friends, in action as in name, And yet be mindful of your ancient fame.

<p/>Swift through the spacious plain he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sent a look; One instant saw, one instant overtook The distant band, that on the sandy shore The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.
<p/>There his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) own mail unbraced the field bestrow'd; His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) train to Troy convey'd the massy load. Now blazing in the immortal arms he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stands;
<p/>The work and present of celestial hands; By aged Peleus to Achilles given, As first to Peleus by the court of heaven: His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) father's arms not long Achilles wears, Forbid by fate to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) father's years.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>), proud in triumph, glittering from afar, The god whose thunder rends the troubled air Beheld with pity; as apart he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sat,
<p/>And, conscious, look'd through all the scene of fate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) shook the sacred honours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) head; Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;
<p/>In heavenly panoply divinely bright Thou stand`st, and armies tremble at thy sight, As at Achilles' self! beneath thy dart Lies slain the great Achilles' dearer part.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end! A moment's glory; and what fates attend! Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn, Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.

Then with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sable brow he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) gave the nod That seals his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) word; the sanction of the god.
<p/>Fill'd with the god, enlarged his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) members grew, Through all his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) veins a sudden vigour flew, The blood in brisker tides began to roll, And Mars himself came rushing on his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) soul.
<p/>The stubborn arms -LRB-by Jove's command disposed-RRB- Conform'd spontaneous, and around him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) closed: Exhorting loud through all the field he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) strode, And look'd, and moved, Achilles, or a god.

<p/>Vain hope! what numbers shall the field o'erspread, What victims perish round the mighty dead! Great Ajax mark'd the growing storm from far, And thus bespoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) brother of the war:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend; And all our wars and glories at an end! ' Tis not this corse alone

<p/>See what a tempest direful Hector spreads, And lo! it bursts , it thunders on our heads! Call on our Greeks, if any hear the call,
<p/>The bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>The warrior raised his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) voice, and wide around The field re-echoed the distressful sound.
<p/>'' O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven! Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:
<p/>All, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far, All, whom I see not through this cloud of war; Come all!
<p/>Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race! let generous rage your arms employ, And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy.
<p/>'' Oilean Ajax first the voice obey'd , Swift was his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) pace, and ready was his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) aid: Next him (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) Idomeneus, more slow with age, And
<p/>Merion, burning with a hero's rage. The long-succeeding numbers who can name? But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame.
<p/>Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng; Whole Troy embodied rush'd with shouts along. Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves, Where some swoln river disembogues his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) waves,
<p/>Full in the mouth is stopp'd the rushing tide, The boiling ocean works from side to side, The river trembles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) utmost shore, And distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.
<p/>Jove, pouring darkness o'er the mingled fight, Conceals the warriors' shining helms in night: To him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), the chief for whom the hosts contend Had lived not hateful, for he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) lived a friend:
<p/>Nor less resolved, the firm Achaian band With brazen shields in horrid circle stand. Dead he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) protects him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) with superior care.
<p/>Nor dooms his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) carcase to the birds of air. -LSB-Illustration: FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.-RSB- FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.
<p/>The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain, Repulsed, they yield; the Trojans seize the slain. Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon.
<p/>With headlong force the foremost ranks he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) tore; So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar, And rudely scatters, for a distance round, The frighted hunter and the baying hound.
<p/>The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus' heir, Hippothous, dragg'd the carcase through the war; The sinewy ankles bored, the feet he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bound With thongs inserted through the double wound: Inevitable fate o'ertakes the deed; Doom'd by great Ajax' vengeful lance to bleed: It cleft the helmet's brazen cheeks in twain; The shatter'd crest and horse-hair strow the plain:
<p/>With nerves relax'd he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) tumbles to the ground: The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound: He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) drops Patroclus' foot, and o'er him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) spread, Now lies a sad companion of the dead: Far from Larissa lies, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) native air, And ill requites his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) parents' tender care.
<p/>-LRB-Ajax to Peleus' son the second name, In graceful stature next, and next in fame-RRB- Lamented youth! in life's first bloom he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fell, Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.
<p/>Once more at Ajax Hector's javelin flies; The Grecian marking, as it cut the skies, Shunn'd the descending death; which hissing on, Stretch'd in the dust
<p/>The boldest warrior and the noblest mind: In little Panope, for strength renown'd, He (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) seat, and ruled the realms around.
<p/>Plunged in his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) throat, the weapon drank his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) blood, And deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood; In clanging arms the hero fell and all The fields resounded with his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) weighty fall.
<p/>The Telamonian lance his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) belly rends; The hollow armour burst before the stroke, And through the wound the rushing entrails broke:
<p/>the great Iphytus' son, Schedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) defends, In strong convulsions panting on the sands He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.
<p/>Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train: The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain. And now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield,
<p/>Fled to her (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) ramparts, and resign'd the field; Greece, in her (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) native fortitude elate, With Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate:
<p/>But Phoebus urged Ćneas to the fight; He (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) seem'd like aged Periphas to sight: -LRB-A herald in Anchises' love grown old, Revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.-RRB-
<p/>There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care, By valour, numbers, and by arts of war, Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state, And gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate:
<p/>But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares His (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) partial favour, and assists your wars, Your shameful efforts `gainst yourselves employ, And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``What methods yet, O chief! remain, To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ćneas through the form assumed descries The power conceal'd, and thus to Hector cries: <div class="bookquote">``Oh lasting shame!
<p/>to our own fears a prey, We seek our ramparts, and desert the day. A god, nor is he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) less, my bosom warms, And tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Hector/HECTOR/Stern</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) spoke, and foremost to the combat flew: The bold example all his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) hosts pursue. Then, first, Leocritus beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) bled,
<p/>In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede; Who view'd his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fall, and, grieving at the chance, Swift to revenge it sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) angry lance; The whirling lance, with vigorous force address'd, Descends, and pants in Apisaon's breast; From rich Paeonia's vales the warrior came,
<p/>Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain, And rush'd to combat, but he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) rush'd in vain: Indissolubly firm, around the dead, Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread, And hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,
<p/>Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame. A brazen bulwark, and an iron wood. Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care,
<p/>And stands the centre and the soul of all: Fix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground: On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled, And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.
<p/>Greece, in close order, and collected might, Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight; Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns, And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.
<p/>In one thick darkness all the fight was lost; The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host Seem'd as extinct: day ravish'd from their eyes, And all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies.
<p/>And in an orb contracts the crowded war, Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall, Such o'er Patroclus' body hung the night,
<p/>No vapour rested on the mountain's head, The golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray, And all the broad expansion flamed with day.
<p/>The rest in sunshine fought, and open light; Unclouded there, the aerial azure spread, Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,
<p/>And here and there their scatter'd arrows light: But death and darkness o'er the carcase spread, There burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled.
<p/>Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear, -LRB-Their fellows routed,-RRB- toss the distant spear, And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command, When from the ships he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) sent the Pylian band.
<p/>The youthful brothers thus for fame contend, Nor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend; In thought they view'd him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) still, with martial joy, Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.
<p/>But round the corse the heroes pant for breath, And thick and heavy grows the work of death: O'erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore, Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o'er; Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise, And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.
<p/>As when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide, Strain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side, The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o'er
<p/>The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore: So tugging round the corse both armies stood; The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood; While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ, Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy.
<p/>Not Pallas' self, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breast when fury warms, Nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Greeks</b></font>) whose anger sets the world in arms, Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign'd; Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.
<p/>Achilles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) ships at distance lay, Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day; He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>), yet unconscious of Patroclus' fall, In dust extended under Ilion's wall, Expects him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) glorious from the conquered plain, And for his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) wish'd return prepares in vain; Though well he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) knew, to make proud Ilion bend Was more than heaven had destined to his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) friend.
<p/>Perhaps to him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>): this Thetis had reveal'd; The rest, in pity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) son, conceal'd. Still raged the conflict round the hero dead, And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.
<p/>'' Cursed be the man -LRB-even private Greeks would say-RRB- Who dares desert this well-disputed day! First may the cleaving earth before our eyes Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice; First perish all, ere
<p/>haughty Troy shall boast We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!'' Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said, <div class="bookquote">``Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Trojans</b></font>)</div><p/>Meantime, at distance from the scene of blood, The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood: Their godlike master slain before their eyes, They wept, and shared in human miseries.-LRB-248-RRB-
<p/>In vain Automedon now shakes the rein, Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain; Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,
<p/>Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe: Still as a tombstone, never to be moved, On some good man or woman unreproved Lays its eternal weight; or fix'd, as stands A marble courser by the sculptor's hands, Placed on the hero's grave.
<p/>Then clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise, And shake the brazen concave of the skies. Along their face The big round drops coursed down with silent pace, Conglobing on the dust.
<p/>Their manes, that late Circled their arched necks, and waved in state, Trail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread, And prone to earth was hung their languid head: Nor Jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look,
<p/>While thus relenting to the steeds he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) spoke: ``Unhappy coursers of immortal strain, Exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;
<p/>what is there of inferior birth, That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth; What wretched creature of what wretched kind, Than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?
<p/>Did we your race on mortal man bestow, Only, alas! to share in mortal woe? For ah! A miserable race! but cease to mourn:
<p/>For not by you shall Priam's son be borne High on the splendid car: one glorious prize He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.
<p/>Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart, Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart. Automedon your rapid flight shall bear Safe to the navy through the storm of war.
<p/>For yet 'tis given to Troy to ravage o'er The field, and spread her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) slaughters to the shore; The sun shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) conquer, till his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fall With sacred darkness shades the face of all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said; and breathing in the immortal horse Excessive spirit, urged them to the course; From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear The kindling chariot through the parted war: So flies a vulture through the clamorous train Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.
<p/>From danger now with swiftest speed they flew, And now to conquest with like speed pursue; Sole in the seat the charioteer remains, Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins:
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brave Alcimedon beheld distress'd, Approach'd the chariot, and the chief address'd: <div class="bookquote">``What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare, Alone, unaided, in the thickest war?

<p/>The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes; No Greek like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) the heavenly steeds restrains, Or holds their fury in suspended reins:
<p/>Patroclus, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) lived, their rage could tame, But now Patroclus is an empty name! To thee I yield the seat, to thee resign
<p/>The ruling charge: the task of fight be mine. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) said. Alcimedon, with active heat, Snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.

<p/>The glorious steeds our ready arms invite, Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight. Can such opponents stand when we assail?
<p/>The son of Venus to the counsel yields; Then o'er their backs they spread their solid shields: With brass refulgent the broad surface shined, And thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.
<p/>Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds; Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds: In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn, In vain advance!
<p/>Unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail. '' not fated to return. Unmov'd, Automedon attends the fight, Implores the Eternal, and collects his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might.

<p/>Then turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) friend, with dauntless mind: <div class="bookquote">``Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind! ''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Then through the field he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) voice aloud, And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd, With great Atrides.
<p/>Turn where distress demands immediate aid; The dead, encircled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) friends, forego, And save the living from a fiercer foe.
<p/>'' Hither turn, -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) said,-RRB- Unhelp'd we stand, unequal to engage The force of Hector, and Ćneas' rage: Yet mighty as they are, my force to prove Is only mine: the event belongs to Jove.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung, Which pass'd the shield of Aretus the young: It pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) belt, emboss'd with curious art, Then in the lower belly struck the dart.
<p/>As when a ponderous axe, descending full, Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:-LRB-249-RRB- Struck `twixt the horns, he (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) springs with many a bound,
<p/>'' Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground: Thus fell the youth; the air his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) soul received, And the spear trembled as his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) entrails heaved.
<p/>Now at Automedon the Trojan foe Discharged his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) lance; the meditated blow, Stooping, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) shunn'd; the javelin idly fled, And hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head; Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear In long vibrations spent its fury there.
<p/>With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed, But each brave Ajax heard, and interposed; Nor longer Hector with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) Trojans stood, But left their slain companion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) blood: His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) arms Automedon divests, and cries, <div class="bookquote">``Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice: Thus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid, Poor as it is, some offering to thy shade.

<p/>And now Minerva from the realms of air Descends impetuous, and renews the war; For, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid, The lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Pleased to be first of all the powers address'd, She (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) breathes new vigour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) hero's breast, And fills with keen revenge, with fell despite, Desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.
<p/>So burns the vengeful hornet -LRB-soul all o'er-RRB-, Repulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore; -LRB-Bold son of air and heat-RRB- on angry wings Untamed, untired, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) turns, attacks, and stings.
<p/>Fired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew, And sent his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) soul with every lance he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) threw. There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame, Aetion's son, and Podes was his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name:
<p/>With riches honour'd, and with courage bless'd, By Hector loved, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) comrade, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) guest; Through his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) broad belt the spear a passage found, And, ponderous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) falls, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) arms resound.
<p/>Sudden at Hector's side Apollo stood, Like Phaenops, Asius' son, appear'd the god; -LRB-Asius the great, who held his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) wealthy reign In fair Abydos, by the rolling main.-RRB-
<p/>'' Oh prince! -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) cried-RRB- Oh foremost once in fame! What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name? Dost thou at length to Menelaus yield, A chief once thought no terror of the field?
<p/>Yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) bears victorious, while our army flies: By the same arm illustrious Podes bled; The friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!''
<p/>This heard, o'er Hector spreads a cloud of woe, Rage lifts his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) lance, and drives him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) on the foe. But now the Eternal shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sable shield, That shaded Ide and all the subject field Beneath its ample verge.
<p/>A rolling cloud Involved the mount; the thunder roar'd aloud; The affrighted hills from their foundations nod, And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god: At one regard of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) all-seeing eye
<p/>Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led; For as the brave Boeotian turn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) head To face the foe, Polydamas drew near, And razed his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) shoulder with a shorten'd spear:
<p/>By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain, Pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain, Grasps his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) once formidable lance in vain.
<p/>As Hector follow'd, Idomen address'd The flaming javelin to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) manly breast; The brittle point before his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) corslet yields; Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields: High on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) chariots the Cretan stood, The son of Priam whirl'd the massive wood.
<p/>But erring from its aim, the impetuous spear Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer Of martial Merion: Coeranus his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) name, Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.
<p/>The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors fly. On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low, Had graced the triumphs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) Trojan foe,
<p/>But the brave squire the ready coursers brought, And with his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) life his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) master's safety bought. Between his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) cheek and ear the weapon went,
<p/>Prone from the seat he (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) tumbles to the plain; His (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) dying hand forgets the falling rein: This Merion reaches, bending from the car, And urges to desert the hopeless war:
<p/>The teeth it shatter'd, and the tongue it rent. Idomeneus consents; the lash applies; And the swift chariot to the navy flies.
<p/>Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried, And conquest shifting to the Trojan side, Turn'd by the hand of Jove.
<p/>Then thus begun, To Atreus's seed, the godlike Telamon: <div class="bookquote">``Alas! who sees not Jove's almighty hand Transfers the glory to the Trojan band?
<p/>Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart, He (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) guides each arrow to a Grecian heart: Not so our spears; incessant though they rain, He (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) suffers every lance to fall in vain.
<p/>Deserted of the god, yet let us try What human strength and prudence can supply; If yet this honour'd corse, in triumph borne, May glad the fleets that hope not our return, Who tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates, And still hear Hector thundering at their gates.
<p/>Some hero too must be despatch'd to bear The mournful message to Pelides' ear; For sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) knows not, distant on the shore, His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) friend, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) loved Patroclus, is no more.
<p/>But such a chief I spy not through the host: The men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost In general darkness--Lord of earth and air!
<p/>Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore; Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more: If Greece must perish, we thy will obey,
<p/>Oh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer: But let us perish in the face of day! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the hero</b></font>)</div>With tears the hero spoke, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) prayer
<p/>The god relenting clear'd the clouded air; Forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray; The blaze of armour flash'd against the day.
<p/>'' Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight; If yet Antilochus survives the fight, Let him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) to great Achilles' ear convey
<p/>So turns the lion from the nightly fold, Though high in courage, and with hunger bold, Long gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex'd by hounds, Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds; The darts fly round him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) from a hundred hands, And the red terrors of the blazing brands: Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day
<p/>Sour he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) departs, and quits the untasted prey, So moved Atrides from his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) dangerous place With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace; The foe, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) fear'd, might yet Patroclus gain, And much admonish'd, much adjured his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) train: <div class="bookquote">``O guard these relics to your charge consign'd, And bear the merits of the dead in mind; How skill'd he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) was in each obliging art; The mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:
<p/>The fatal news'' (<font color='red'><b>Patroclus</b></font>)</div>--Atrides hastes away. He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) was, alas! but fate decreed his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) end, In death a hero, as in life a friend!
<p/>As the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye Of all that wings the mid aerial sky, The sacred eagle, from his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) walks above Looks down, and sees the distant thicket move; Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare, Snatches his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) life amid the clouds of air.
<p/>Not with less quickness, his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) exerted sight Pass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight: Till on the left the chief he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) sought, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) found, Cheering his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) men, and spreading deaths around:
<p/>'' So parts the chief; from rank to rank he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) flew, And round on all sides sent his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) piercing view. To him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) the king:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beloved of Jove! draw near, For sadder tidings never touch'd thy ear; Thy eyes have witness'd what a fatal turn! How Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.

<p/>This is not all: Patroclus, on the shore Now pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the king Beloved</b></font>)</div>The youthful warrior heard with silent woe, From his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) fair eyes the tears began to flow:
<p/>Big with the mighty grief, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) strove to say What sorrow dictates, but no word found way. To brave Laodocus his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) arms he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) flung,
<p/>Who, near him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) wheeling, drove his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) steeds along; Then ran the mournful message to impart, With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.
<p/>Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands -LRB-Though sore distress'd-RRB- to aid the Pylian bands; But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain; Himself returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) Patroclus slain.
<p/>'' Gone is Antilochus -LRB-the hero said-RRB-; But hope not, warriors, for Achilles' aid: Though fierce his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) rage, unbounded be his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) woe, Unarm'd, he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) fights not with the Trojan foe. '
<p/>Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain, 'Tis our own vigour must the dead regain, And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate Troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.
<p/>'' '''Tis well -LRB-said Ajax-RRB-, be it then thy care, With Merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear; Myself, and my bold brother will sustain The shock of Hector and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) charging train:
<p/>Nor fear we armies, fighting side by side; What Troy can dare, we have already tried, Have tried it, and have stood.
<p/>'' The hero said. High from the ground the warriors heave the dead. A general clamour rises at the sight : Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.
<p/>Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood, With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood, Voracious hounds, that many a length before Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar; But if the savage turns his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) glaring eye, They howl aloof, and round the forest fly.
<p/>Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour, Wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower: But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,
<p/>While thus aloft the hero's corse they bear, Behind them rages all the storm of war: Confusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along
<p/>: Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire To whelm some city under waves of fire; Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes, Now crack the blazing temples of the gods;
<p/>All pale they tremble and forsake the field. The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls, And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.
<p/>As when two mules, along the rugged road, From the steep mountain with exerted strength Drag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length; Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil, The enormous timber lumbering down the hill:
<p/>The heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load: So these-- Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands, And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.
<p/>Thus when a river swell'd with sudden rains Spreads his (<font color='blue'><b>heroes</b></font>) broad waters o'er the level plains, Some interposing hill the stream divides.
<p/>And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides. Still close they follow, close the rear engage; Aeneas storms, and Hector foams with rage:
<p/>While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains, Wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes, That shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung High on poised pinions, threats their callow young.
<p/>So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly, Such the wild terror, and the mingled cry: Within, without the trench, and all the way, Strow'd in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;
<p/>Such horror Jove impress'd! yet still proceeds The work of death, and still the battle bleeds. -LSB-Illustration: VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM.-RSB-
<p/>VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM. BOOK XVIII. ARGUMENT. THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES, AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN. The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by Antilochus.
<p/>Thetis, hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) lamentations, comes with all her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sea- nymphs to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>). The speeches of the mother and son on this occasion.
<p/>Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) to show himself at the head of the intrenchments.
<p/>The sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) turns the fortunes of the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the Greeks.
<p/>The Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas disagree in their opinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to remain encamped in the field.
<p/>The grief of Achilles over the body of Patroclus. Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) son.
<p/>The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing, take up this book: the scene is at Achilles' tent on the sea-shore, from whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.
<p/>The description of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that noble one of the shield of Achilles. Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,-LRB-250-RRB-
<p/>Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow, Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe: There sat Achilles, shaded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sails, On hoisted yards extended to the gales; Pensive he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sat; for all that fate design'd Rose in sad prospect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) boding mind.
<p/>And now it rises, now it sinks by turns. Thus to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) soul he (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Ah! what constrains The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?
<p/>Is this the day, which heaven so long ago Ordain'd, to sink me with the weight of woe? -LRB-So Thetis warn'd;-RRB- when by a Trojan hand
<p/>The bravest of the Myrmidonian band Should lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree; Fallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>)!
<p/>In vain I charged him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) soon to quit the plain, And warn'd to shun Hectorean force in vain!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thus while he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) thinks, Antilochus appears, And tells the melancholy tale with tears.
<p/>'' Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear; And wretched I, the unwilling messenger! Dead is Patroclus! For his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) corse they fight; His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) naked corse: his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) arms are Hector's right.
<p/>Cast on the ground, with furious hands he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) spread The scorching ashes o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) graceful head; His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) purple garments, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) golden hairs, Those he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) deforms with dust, and these he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) tears; On the hard soil his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) groaning breast he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) threw, And roll'd and grovell'd, as to earth he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) grew.
<p/>The virgin captives, with disorder'd charms, -LRB-Won by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own, or by Patroclus' arms,-RRB- Rush'd from their tents with cries; and gathering round, Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:
<p/>'' A sudden horror shot through all the chief, And wrapp'd his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) senses in the cloud of grief; While Nestor's son sustains a manlier part, And mourns the warrior with a warrior's heart;
<p/>Hangs on his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) arms, amidst his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) frantic woe, And oft prevents the meditated blow. Far in the deep abysses of the main,-LRB-251-RRB-
<p/>With hoary Nereus, and the watery train, The mother-goddess from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-goddess</b></font>) crystal throne Heard his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) loud cries, and answer'd groan for groan.
<p/>Thalia, Glauce -LRB-every watery name-RRB-, Nesaea mild, and silver Spio came: Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh, And the blue languish of soft Alia's eye.
<p/>Their locks Actaea and Limnoria rear, Then Proto, Doris, Panope appear, Thoa, Pherusa, Doto, Melita; Agave gentle, and Amphithoe gay: Next Callianira, Callianassa show Their sister looks; Dexamene the slow, And swift Dynamene, now cut the tides: Iaera now the verdant wave divides:
<p/>Nemertes with Apseudes lifts the head, Bright Galatea quits her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pearly bed; These Orythia, Clymene, attend, Maera, Amphinome, the train extend; And black Janira, and Janassa fair, And Amatheia with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) amber hair.
<p/>All these, and all that deep in ocean held Their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill'd; Each beat her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ivory breast with silent woe,
<p/>The circling Nereids with their mistress weep, And all the sea-green sisters of the deep. Till Thetis' sorrows thus began to flow: <div class="bookquote">``Hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!
<p/>How just a cause has Thetis to complain! How wretched, were I mortal, were my fate! How more than wretched in the immortal state!

<p/>I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>): but the fates ordain He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) never, never must return again. So short a space the light of heaven to view, So short, alas! and fill'd with anguish too!
<p/>I cannot ease them, but I must deplore; I go at least to bear a tender part, And mourn my loved-one with a mother's heart.
<p/>Hear how his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) sorrows echo through the shore!

<p/>The immortal mother, standing close beside Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mournful offspring, to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) sighs replied; Along the coast their mingled clamours ran, And thus the silver-footed dame began: <div class="bookquote">``Why mourns my son?

<p/>As when from some beleaguer'd town arise The smokes, high curling to the shaded skies; -LRB-Seen from some island, o'er the main afar, When men distress'd hang out the sign of war;-RRB-
<p/>Soon as the sun in ocean hides his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) rays, Thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze; With long-projected beams the seas are bright, And heaven's high arch reflects the ruddy light:
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) spoke, and pass'd in air. So from Achilles' head the splendours rise, Reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies.
<p/>Forth march'd the chief, and distant from the crowd, High on the rampart raised his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) voice aloud; With her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) own shout Minerva swells the sound; Troy starts
<p/>As the loud trumpet's brazen mouth from far With shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war, Struck from the walls, the echoes float on high, And the round bulwarks and thick towers reply; So high his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) brazen voice the hero
<p/>astonish'd, and the shores rebound. rear'd: Hosts dropp'd their arms, and trembled as they heard: And back the chariots roll, and coursers bound,
<p/>And steeds and men lie mingled on the ground. Aghast they see the living lightnings play, And turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray.
<p/>Thrice from the trench his (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) dreadful voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Struck</b></font>) raised, And thrice they fled, confounded and amazed. Twelve in the tumult wedged, untimely
<p/>rush'd On their own spears, by their own chariots crush'd: While, shielded from the darts, the Greeks obtain The long-contended carcase of the slain.
<p/>A lofty bier the breathless warrior bears : Around, his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) sad companions melt in tears. But chief Achilles, bending down his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) head, Pours unavailing sorrows o'er the dead,
<p/>Whom late triumphant, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) steeds and car, He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sent refulgent to the field of war; -LRB-Unhappy change!-RRB- now senseless, pale, he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) found, Stretch'd forth, and gash'd with many a gaping wound.
<p/>Meantime, unwearied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) heavenly way, In ocean's waves the unwilling light of day Quench'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) red orb, at Juno's high command,

<p/>In haste, and standing; for to sit they fear'd. 'Twas now no season for prolong'd debate; They saw Achilles, and in him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) their fate.
<p/>Polydamas at last, Skill'd to discern the future by the past, The son of Panthus, thus express'd his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fears -LRB-The friend of Hector, and of equal years; The self-same night to both a being gave, One wise in council, one in action brave-RRB-: -LSB-Illustration: JUNO COMMANDING THE SUN TO SET.-RSB-
<p/>In free debate, my friends, your sentence speak; For me, I move, before the morning break, To raise our camp: too dangerous here our post, Far from Troy walls, and on a naked coast.
<p/>A sudden council call'd: each chief appear'd Silent they stood: JUNO COMMANDING THE SUN TO SET. '' I deem'd not Greece so dreadful,
<p/>while engaged In mutual feuds her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) king and hero raged; Then, while we hoped our armies might prevail We boldly camp'd beside a thousand sail.
<p/>I dread Pelides now: his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) rage of mind Not long continues to the shores confined, Nor to the fields, where long in equal fray Contending nations won and lost the day; For Troy, for Troy, shall henceforth be the strife, And the hard contest not for fame, but life.
<p/>If but the morrow's sun behold us here, That arm, those terrors, we shall feel, not fear; And hearts that now disdain, shall leap with joy, If heaven permit them then to enter Troy.
<p/>Haste then to Ilion, while the favouring night Detains these terrors, keeps that arm from fight. Let not my fatal prophecy be true, Nor what I tremble but to think, ensue.
<p/>Whatever be our fate, yet let us try What force of thought and reason can supply; Let us on counsel for our guard
<p/>depend; The town her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) gates and bulwarks shall defend. When morning dawns, our well-appointed powers, Array'd in arms, shall line the lofty towers.
<p/>Let the fierce hero, then, when fury calls, Vent his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) mad vengeance on our rocky walls, Or fetch a thousand circles round the plain, Till his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) spent coursers seek the fleet again: So may his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) rage be tired, and labour'd down!
<p/>And dogs shall tear him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) ere he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) sack the town.'' <div class="bookquote">``Return! -LRB-said Hector, fired with stern disdain-RRB- What! coop whole armies in our walls again?

<p/>But while inglorious in her (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) walls we stay'd Great Jove at length my arms to conquest calls, And shuts the Grecians in their wooden walls,
<p/>Darest thou dispirit whom the gods incite? Flies any Trojan? I shall stop his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) flight. To better counsel then attention lend; Take due refreshment, and the watch attend.
<p/>If there be one whose riches cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) care, Forth let him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) bring them for the troops to share; 'Tis better generously bestow'd on those,

<p/>Meanwhile to Juno, in the realms above, -LRB-His (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) wife and sister,-RRB- spoke almighty Jove. '' At last thy will prevails: great Peleus' son Rises in arms: such grace thy Greeks have won.

<p/>Their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn'd, Resounding breathed: at once the blast expires, And twenty forges catch at once the fires; Just as the god directs, now loud, now low, They raise a tempest, or they gently blow; In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd, And stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold; Before, deep fix'd, the eternal anvils stand; The ponderous hammer loads his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) better hand, His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round, And thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.
<p/>Soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) bade them blow, the bellows turn'd Then first he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) form'd the immense and solid shield ; Rich various artifice emblazed the field; Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound;-LRB-253-RRB-
<p/>A silver chain suspends the massy round; Five ample plates the broad expanse compose, And godlike labours on the surface rose.
<p/>There earth, there heaven, there ocean he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) design'd; The unwearied sun, the moon completely round; The starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd; The Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team; And great Orion's more refulgent beam; To which, around the axle of the sky, The Bear, revolving, points his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) golden eye, Still shines exalted on the ethereal plain, Nor bathes his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) blazing forehead in the main.
<p/>There shone the image of the master-mind: Two cities radiant on the shield appear, The image one of peace, and one of war.
<p/>Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight, And solemn dance, and hymeneal rite; Along the street the new-made brides are led, With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed:
<p/>The youthful dancers in a circle bound To the soft flute, and cithern's silver sound: Through the fair streets the matrons in a row Stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.
<p/>There in the forum swarm a numerous train; The subject of debate, a townsman slain: One pleads the fine discharged, which one denied, And bade the public and the laws decide: The witness is produced on either hand: For this, or that, the partial people stand
<p/>: The appointed heralds still the noisy bands, And form a ring, with sceptres in their hands: On seats of stone, within the sacred place,-LRB-254-RRB- The reverend elders nodded o'er the case; Alternate, each the attesting sceptre took, And rising solemn, each his (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) sentence spoke Two golden talents lay amidst, in sight,
<p/>The prize of him (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) who best adjudged the right. Another part -LRB-a prospect differing far-RRB--LRB-255-RRB- Glow'd with refulgent arms, and horrid war.
<p/>Meantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care, A secret ambush on the foe prepare: Their wives, their children, and the watchful band Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand.
<p/>They march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold: Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold, And gold their armour: these the squadron led, August, divine, superior by the head!
<p/>Two mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace, And one would pillage, one would burn the place. A place for ambush fit they found, and stood,
<p/>Cover'd with shields, beside a silver flood. Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem If sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.
<p/>Soon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains, And steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains; Behind them piping on their reeds they go, Nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.
<p/>In arms the glittering squadron rising round Rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground; Whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,
<p/>The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear; They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war, They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;
<p/>And, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains! The waving silver seem'd to blush with blood. There Tumult, there Contention stood
<p/>confess'd; One rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast; One held a living foe, that freshly bled With new-made wounds; another dragg'd a dead; Now here, now there, the carcases they tore: Fate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.
<p/>And the whole war came out, and met the eye; And each bold figure seem'd to live or die. A field deep
<p/>The third time labour'd by the sweating hind; The shining shares full many ploughmen guide, And turn their crooked yokes on every side.
<p/>Still as at either end they wheel around, The master meets them with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) goblet crown'd; The hearty draught rewards, renews their toil, Then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:
<p/>Another field rose high with waving grain; With bended sickles stand the reaper train: Here stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found, Sheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.
<p/>With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands; The gatherers follow, and collect in bands; And last the children, in whose arms are borne -LRB-Too short to gripe them-RRB- the brown sheaves of corn.
<p/>furrow'd next the god design'd,-LRB-256-RRB- Behind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd; And sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold. The rustic monarch of the field descries, With silent glee, the heaps around him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) rise.
<p/>A ready banquet on the turf is laid, Beneath an ample oak's expanded shade. The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare; The reaper's due repast, the woman's care.
<p/>Next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines, Bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines; A deeper dye the dangling clusters show, And curl'd on silver props, in order glow:
<p/>To this, one pathway gently winding leads, Where march a train with baskets on their heads, -LRB-Fair maids and blooming youths,-RRB- that smiling bear The purple product of the autumnal year.
<p/>To these a youth awakes the warbling strings, Whose tender lay the fate of Linus sings; In measured dance behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Linus</b></font>) move the train, Tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.
<p/>A darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place; And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace. Here herds of oxen march, erect and bold, Rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,
<p/>And speed to meadows on whose sounding shores A rapid torrent through the rushes roars: Four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand, And nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.
<p/>appear'd; And seized a bull, the master of the herd: He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood; They tore his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) flesh, and drank his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sable blood.
<p/>Two lions rushing from the wood The dogs -LRB-oft cheer'd in vain-RRB- desert the prey, Dread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.
<p/>Next this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads Deep through fair forests, and a length of meads, And stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between; And fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.
<p/>In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen, Form'd by Daedalean art; a comely band Of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.
<p/>The maids in soft simars of linen dress'd; The youths all graceful in the glossy vest: Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd; Of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold, That glittering gay, from silver belts depend.
<p/>A figured dance succeeds; such once was seen Now all at once they rise, at once descend, With well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,
<p/>Confusedly regular, the moving maze: Now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring, And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:
<p/>The gazing multitudes admire around: Two active tumblers in the centre bound; Now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend: And general songs the sprightly revel end.
<p/>So whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd, And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost. Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) last hand, and pour'd the ocean round: In living silver seem'd the waves to roll, And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.

<p/>Thetis brings to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) son the armour made by Vulcan. Agamemnon and Achilles are solemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that occasion.
<p/>Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of Ulysses.
<p/>The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where Briseis laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) friend.

<p/>And thus, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand soft touching, Thetis said: <div class="bookquote">``Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow; Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow'd, Arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god.
<p/>Then drops the radiant burden on the ground; Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around; Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise, And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.
<p/>Unmoved the hero kindles at the show, And feels with rage divine his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) bosom glow; From his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) fierce eyeballs living flames expire, And flash incessant like a stream of fire: He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) turns the radiant gift: and feeds his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) mind

<p/>Nectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower'd O'er all the corse. The flies forbid their prey, Untouch'd it rests, and sacred from decay.
<p/>The heroes heard, and all the naval train That tend the ships, or guide them o'er the main, Alarm'd, transported, at the well-known sound, Frequent and full, the great assembly crown'd;
<p/>Achilles to the strand obedient went: The shores resounded with the voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sent. Studious to see the terror of the plain, Long lost to battle, shine in arms again.
<p/>Tydides and Ulysses first appear, Lame with their wounds, and leaning on the spear; These on the sacred seats of council placed, The king of men, Atrides, came the last: He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) too sore wounded by Agenor's son.
<p/>Achilles -LRB-rising in the midst-RRB- begun: <div class="bookquote">``O monarch! better far had been the fate Of thee, of me, of all the Grecian state,

<p/>Then many a hero had not press'd the shore, Nor Troy's glad fields been fatten'd with our gore. Long, long shall Greece the woes we caused bewail, And sad posterity repeat the tale.
<p/>But this, no more the subject of debate, Is past, forgotten, and resign'd to fate. Why should, alas, a mortal man, as I, Burn with a fury that can never die?
<p/>Here then my anger ends: let war succeed, And even as Greece has bled, let Ilion bleed. Now call the hosts, and try if in our sight Troy yet shall dare to camp a second night!

<p/>Awhile your loud, untimely joy suspend, And let your rash, injurious clamours end: Unruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause, Wrong the best speaker, and the justest cause.
<p/>And grant your monarch an impartial ear: Nor charge on me, ye Greeks, the dire debate: Know, angry Jove, and all-compelling Fate, With fell Erinnys, urged my wrath that day
<p/>When from Achilles' arms I forced the prey. What then could I against the will of heaven? Not by myself, but vengeful Ate driven; She (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>), Jove's dread daughter, fated to infest The race of mortals,
<p/>enter'd in my breast. Not on the ground that haughty fury treads, But prints her (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) lofty footsteps on the heads Of mighty men; inflicting as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) goes Long-festering wounds, inextricable woes!
<p/>And Jove himself, the sire of men and gods, The world's great ruler, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) venom'd dart; Deceived by Juno's wiles, and female art:
<p/>For when Alcmena's nine long months were run, And Jove expected his (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) immortal son, To gods and goddesses the unruly joy
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) show'd, and vaunted of his (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) matchless boy: `From us, -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) said-RRB- this day an infant springs, Fated to rule, and born a king of kings.'
<p/>Of old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jove</b></font>) stalk'd amid the bright abodes; Saturnia ask'd an oath, to vouch the truth, And fix dominion on the favour'd youth.
<p/>The Thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud, Pronounced those solemn words that bind a god. The joyful goddess, from Olympus' height, Swift to Achaian Argos bent her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) flight:
<p/>Scarce seven moons gone, lay Sthenelus's wife; She (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) push'd her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) lingering infant into life: Her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) charms Alcmena's coming labours stay, And stop the babe, just issuing to the day.
<p/>A youth -LRB-said she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>)-RRB- of Jove's immortal kind Is this day born: from Sthenelus he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) springs, And claims thy promise to be king of kings.'
<p/>Then bids Saturnius bear his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) oath in mind; ' Grief seized the Thunderer, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) oath engaged; Stung to the soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) sorrow'd, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) raged.

<p/>Once spread the inviting banquet in our tents: Thy sweet society, thy winning care, Once stay'd Achilles, rushing to the war.

<p/>What greater sorrow could afflict my breast, What more if hoary Peleus were deceased? Who now, perhaps, in Phthia dreads to hear His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) son's sad fate, and drops a tender tear.
<p/>What more, should Neoptolemus the brave, My only offspring, sink into the grave? If yet that offspring lives; -LRB-I distant far, Of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.-RRB-
<p/>I hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear My tender orphan with a parent's care, From Scyros' isle conduct him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) o'er the main, And glad his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) paternal reign, The lofty palace, and the large domain.
<p/>I could not this, this cruel stroke attend; Fate claim'd Achilles, but might spare his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) friend. For Peleus breathes no more the vital air; Or drags a wretched life of age and care,
<p/>But till the news of my sad fate invades His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) hastening soul, and sinks him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) to the shades.

<p/>So swift through ether the shrill harpy springs, The wide air floating to her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) ample wings, To great Achilles she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) flight address'd,
<p/>And pour'd divine ambrosia in his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) breast,-LRB-259-RRB- With nectar sweet, -LRB-refection of the gods!-RRB- Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.
<p/>As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow, And scatter o'er the fields the driving snow; From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies, Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies: So helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields, Catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields; Broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays, Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze; Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound; With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,
<p/>Full in the midst, high-towering o'er the rest, His (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) limbs in arms divine Achilles dress'd; Arms which the father of the fire bestow'd, Forged on the eternal anvils of the god.
<p/>Grief and revenge his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) furious heart inspire, His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) glowing eyeballs roll with living fire; He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) grinds his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) teeth, and furious with delay O'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.
<p/>The silver cuishes first his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) thighs infold; Then o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) breast was braced the hollow gold; The brazen sword a various baldric tied, That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) side; And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield Blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.
<p/>So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears, Wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears, Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high, Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky: With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again; Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.
<p/>Next, his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) high head the helmet graced; behind The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind: Like the red star, that from his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) flaming hair Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war; So stream'd the golden honours from his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) head, Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.
<p/>The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes; His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) arms he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) poises, and his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) motions tries; Buoy'd by some inward force, he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) seems to swim, And feels a pinion lifting every limb.
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) great paternal spear, Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear, From Pelion's cloudy top an ash entire Old Chiron fell'd, and shaped it for his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sire; A spear which stern Achilles only wields, The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.
<p/>Now issued from the ships the warrior-train, And like a deluge pour'd upon the plain. Automedon and Alcimus prepare The immortal coursers, and the radiant car;
<p/>-LRB-The silver traces sweeping at their side;-RRB- Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied; The ivory-studded reins, return'd behind, Waved o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd.
<p/>All bright in heavenly arms, above his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) squire Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire; Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way Flames from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) chariot, and restores the day.
<p/>The charioteer then whirl'd the lash around, And swift ascended at one active bound. High o'er the host, all terrible he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) stands, And thunders to his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) steeds these dread commands:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges' strain, -LRB-Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,-RRB- Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear, And learn to make your master more your care: Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword, Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord.
<p/>The generous Xanthus, as the words he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) said, Seem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) head: Trembling he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) stood before the golden wain, And bow'd to dust the honours of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) mane.

<p/>ARGUMENT. THE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES. Jupiter, upon Achilles' return to the battle, calls a council of the gods, and permits them to assist either party.
<p/>The terrors of the combat described, when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages Ćneas to meet Achilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes encounter; but Ćneas is preserved by the assistance of Neptune.
<p/>Achilles falls upon the rest of the Trojans, and is upon the point of killing Hector, but Apollo conveys him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) away in a cloud.
<p/>Achilles pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter. The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy. Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) vessels stood;
<p/>Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call The gods to council in the starry hall: Swift o'er Olympus' hundred hills she (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) flies, And summons all the senate of the skies.
<p/>While near impending from a neighbouring height, Troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight. These shining on, in long procession come To Jove's eternal adamantine dome.
<p/>Not one was absent, not a rural power That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower; Each fair-hair'd dryad of the shady wood, Each azure sister of the silver flood; All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps His (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.
<p/>Even he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) whose trident sways the watery reign Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main, Assumed his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) throne amid the bright abodes, And question'd thus the sire of men and gods:

<p/>Hermes, of profitable arts the sire; And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire: These to the fleet repair with instant flight; The vessels tremble as the gods alight.
<p/>In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came, Mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame, Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow, And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.
<p/>, Each Argive bosom swell'd with manly joy, While great Achilles -LRB-terror of the plain-RRB-, Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.
<p/>Dreadful he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) stood in front of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) host; Pale Troy beheld, and seem'd already lost; Her (<font color='blue'><b>Phoebus</b></font>) bravest heroes pant with inward fear, And trembling see another god of war.
<p/>But when the powers descending swell'd the fight, Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms, Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.
<p/>whose azure round Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown'd; Ere yet the gods their various aid employ Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls, And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) thunders from the Grecian walls.
<p/>In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds: Now through each Trojan heart he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fury pours With voice divine, from Ilion's topmost towers: Now shouts to Simois, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) beauteous hill; The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.
<p/>Mars hovering o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) Troy, his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) terror shrouds Above, the sire of gods his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) thunder rolls, And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.
<p/>Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground; The forests wave, the mountains nod around; Through all their summits tremble Ida's woods, And from their sources boil her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) hundred floods.

<p/>Such war the immortals wage; such horrors rend The world's vast concave, when the gods contend First silver-shafted Phoebus took the plain Against blue Neptune, monarch of the main.

<p/>With fiery Vulcan last in battle stands The sacred flood that rolls on golden sands; Xanthus his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name with those of heavenly birth, But called Scamander by the sons of earth.
<p/>While thus the gods in various league engage, Achilles glow'd with more than mortal rage: Hector he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sought; in search of Hector turn'd
<p/>Saturnia, majesty of heaven, defied. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) eyes around, for Hector only burn'd; And burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow'd
<p/>Ćneas was the first who dared to stay; Apollo wedged him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) in the warrior's way, But swell'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) bosom with undaunted might, Half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.

<p/>In circle close each heavenly party sat, Intent to form the future scheme of fate; But mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high Gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.
<p/>The adverse powers, around Apollo laid, Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade. Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground; The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:
<p/>Steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright, The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light. Amid both hosts -LRB-a dreadful space-RRB- appear, There great Achilles; bold Ćneas, here.
<p/>With towering strides Aeneas first advanced; The nodding plumage on his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) helmet danced: Spread o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) breast the fencing shield he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) bore,
<p/>And, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) moved, his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) javelin flamed before. Not so Pelides ; furious to engage, He (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) rush'd impetuous. Such the lion's rage,
<p/>Who viewing first his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) foes with scornful eyes, Though all in arms the peopled city rise, Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;
<p/>Till at the length, by some brave youth defied, To his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) bold spear the savage turns alone, He (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) murmurs fury with a hollow groan; He (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) grins, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) foams, he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) rolls his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) eyes around Lash'd by his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) tail his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) heaving sides resound; He (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) calls up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) rage; he (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) grinds his (<font color='blue'><b>Aeneas</b></font>) teeth, Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.
<p/>Ere yet the stern encounter join'd, begun The seed of Thetis thus to Venus' son: ``Why comes Ćneas through the ranks so far?
<p/>So fierce Achilles on Ćneas flies; So stands Ćneas, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) force defies. Seeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) to meet Achilles' arm in war,
<p/>Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies, The partial monarch may refuse the prize; Sons he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) has many; those thy pride may quell: And 'tis his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) fault to love those sons too well, Or, in reward of thy victorious hand, Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land
<p/>In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy, And prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) merits to the throne of Troy? An ample forest, or a fair domain, Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?
<p/>Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot. But can Achilles be so soon forgot? Once -LRB-as I think-RRB- you saw this brandish'd spear
<p/>And then the great Ćneas seem'd to fear: With hearty haste from Ida's mount he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) fled, Nor, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) reach'd Lyrnessus, turn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) head.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) lofty walls not long our progress stay'd; Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid: In Grecian chains her (<font color='blue'><b>Ida</b></font>) captive race were cast; 'Tis true, the great Aeneas fled too fast.
<p/>Defrauded of my conquest once before, What then I lost, the gods this day restore. Go; while thou may`st, avoid the threaten'd fate; Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.

<p/>And coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead: Hence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind, Swift as their mother mares, and father wind.
<p/>These lightly skimming, when they swept the plain, Nor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain; And when along the level seas they flew,-LRB-265-RRB-
<p/>With voice dissembled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) loves he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) neigh'd, Scarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew. Such Erichthonius was: from him (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) there came The sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.
<p/>Three sons renown'd adorn'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) nuptial bed, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymed: The matchless Ganymed, divinely fair, Whom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,
<p/>To bear the cup of Jove -LRB-ethereal guest, The grace and glory of the ambrosial feast-RRB-. The two remaining sons the line divide
<p/>: First rose Laomedon from Ilus' side; From him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) Tithonus, now in cares grown old, And Priam, bless'd with Hector, brave and bold; Clytius and Lampus, ever-honour'd pair; And Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.
<p/>From great Assaracus sprang Capys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) Begat Anchises, and Anchises me. Such is our race: 'tis fortune gives us birth, But Jove alone endues the soul with worth:
<p/>Long in the field of words we may contend, Reproach is infinite, and knows no end, Arm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong; So voluble a weapon is the tongue; Wounded, we wound; and neither side can fail, For every man has equal strength to rail: Women alone, when in the streets they jar, Perhaps excel us in this wordy war; Like us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd, And vent their anger impotent and loud.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), source of power and might! with boundless sway, All human courage gives, or takes away. Cease then-- Our business in the field of fight Is not to question, but to prove our might.
<p/>To all those insults thou hast offer'd here, Receive this answer: 'tis my flying spear. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke. With all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) force the javelin flung, Fix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.
<p/>Far on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outstretch'd arm, Pelides held -LRB-To meet the thundering lance-RRB- his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreadful shield, That trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear Saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fears were vain; impenetrable charms Secured the temper of the ethereal arms. Through two strong plates the point its passage held, But stopp'd, and rested, by the third

<p/>repell'd. Then rising ere he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw, The forceful spear of great Achilles flew, And pierced the Dardan shield's extremest bound, Where the shrill brass return'd
<p/>Ćneas his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contracted body bends, And o'er him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) high the riven targe extends, Sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,
<p/>a sharper sound: Through the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides, And the slight covering of expanded hides. And at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back perceives the quivering spear:
<p/>A fate so near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), chills his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul with fright; And swims before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes the many-colour'd light. Achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries, Draws his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) broad blade, and at Ćneas flies:
<p/>Ćneas rousing as the foe came on, With force collected, heaves a mighty stone: A mass enormous! which in modern days
<p/>No two of earth's degenerate sons could raise. But ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground. Saw the distress, and moved the powers around:

<p/>the double back-plate join'd Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel; And on his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) knees with piercing shrieks he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) fell; The rushing entrails pour'd upon the ground His (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) hands collect; and darkness wraps him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) round.
<p/>When Hector view'd, all ghastly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) gore, Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore, A cloud of sorrow overcast his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) sight,
<p/>: Struck where the crossing belts unite behind, And golden rings His (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) soul no longer brook'd the distant fight: Full in Achilles' dreadful front he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) came, And shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) javelin like a waving flame.
<p/>The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess'd, His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart high-bounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rising breast. '' And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend; The man, that slew Achilles, is his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) friend!
<p/>No more shall Hector's and Pelides' spear Turn from each other in the walks of war.''-- Then with revengeful eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) scann'd him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) o'er: <div class="bookquote">``Come, and receive thy fate!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) spake no more. Hector, undaunted, thus: <div class="bookquote">``Such words employ To one that dreads thee , some unwarlike boy: Such we could give, defying and defied,
<p/>Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride! I know thy force to mine superior far; But heaven alone confers success in war:
<p/>Mean as I am, the gods may guide my dart, And give it entrance in a braver heart. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hector/HECTOR/Stern</b></font>)</div>Then parts the lance: but Pallas' heavenly breath Far from Achilles wafts the winged death:
<p/>The bidden dart again to Hector flies, And at the feet of its great master lies. Achilles closes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) hated foe, His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:
<p/>But present to his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) aid, Apollo shrouds The favour'd hero in a veil of clouds. Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart
<p/>, Thrice in impassive air he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) plunged the dart; The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) foams with fury, and exclaims aloud: <div class="bookquote">``Wretch!
<p/>thou hast `scaped again; once more thy flight Has saved thee, and the partial god of light. But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,
<p/>If any power assist Achilles' hand. Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay.
<p/>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) gluts his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) rage on numbers slain: Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain, Pierced through the neck: he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) panting there, And
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>stopp'd Demuchus, great Philetor's heir. Gigantic chief! deep gash'd the enormous blade, And for the soul an ample passage made.
<p/>Laoganus and Dardanus expire, The valiant sons of an unhappy sire; Both in one instant from the chariot hurl'd, Sunk in one instant to the nether world:
<p/>Nor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds; In vain his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) youth, in vain his (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) beauty pleads; In vain he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) begs thee, with a suppliant's moan, To spare a form, an age so like thy own!
<p/>This difference only their sad fates afford That one the spear destroy'd, and one the sword. Unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art, E'er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!
<p/>While yet he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trembled at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees, and cried, The ruthless falchion oped his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tender side; The panting liver pours a flood of gore That drowns his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bosom till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pants no more.
<p/>next the sword bereaves, Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves; Warm'd in the brain the smoking weapon lies, The purple death comes floating o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Then brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung; He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dropp'd his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm, an unassisting weight, And stood all impotent, expecting fate:
<p/>Through Mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear: The warrior falls, transfix'd from ear to ear. Thy life, Echeclus! Full on his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) neck the falling falchion sped, From his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) broad shoulders hew'd his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) crested head:
<p/>Rhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came, -LRB-The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,-RRB- Succeeds to fate: the spear his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) belly rends; Prone from his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) car the thundering chief descends.
<p/>Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies, And, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies. The squire, who saw expiring on the ground His (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) prostrate master, rein'd the steeds around;
<p/>As when a flame the winding valley fills, And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills; Then o'er the stubble up the mountain flies, Fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies, This way and that, the spreading torrent roars: So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores; Around him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) wide, immense destruction pours And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers As with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er, And thick bestrewn, lies Ceres' sacred floor; When round and round, with never-wearied pain, The trampling steers beat out the unnumber'd grain:
<p/>So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls, Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls, Dash'd from their hoofs while o'er the dead they fly, Black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) back, scarce turn'd, the Pelian javelin gored, And stretch'd the servant o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) dying lord. : The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore; And thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore.
<p/>High o'er the scene of death Achilles stood, All grim with dust, all horrible in blood: Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame; Such is the lust of never-dying fame!
<p/>The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the river Scamander: he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) falls upon the latter with great slaughter: takes twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and kills Lycaon and Asteropeus.
<p/>Scamander attacks him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) waves: Neptune and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length Vulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river.
<p/>-LSB-Illustration: CENTAUR.-RSB- CENTAUR. BOOK XXI. ARGUMENT. THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.-LRB-269-RRB- This Combat ended, the other gods engage each other.
<p/>Agenor only makes a stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo; who -LRB-to delude Achilles-RRB- takes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) Agenor's shape, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) pursues him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) in that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into their city.
<p/>Meanwhile Achilles continues the slaughter, drives the rest into Troy: The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of Scamander.
<p/>The river here divides the flying train, Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain, Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight, Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:
<p/>And now to Xanthus' gliding stream they drove, Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove. -LRB-These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds, And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:-RRB-
<p/>With cries promiscuous all the banks resound, And here, and there, in eddies whirling round, The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.
<p/>As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire, While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire; Driven from the land before the smoky cloud, The clustering legions rush into the flood:
<p/>Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars, The flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores: So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force, Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) bloody lance the hero casts aside, -LRB-Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,-RRB- Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves, Arm'd with his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sword, high brandish'd
<p/>, now he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) whirls it round, Deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound; Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed, And the warm purple circled on the tide.
<p/>o'er the waves: Now down he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) plunges Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly, And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:
<p/>So the huge dolphin tempesting the main, In shoals before him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fly the scaly train, Confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves, Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.
<p/>Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band Twelve chosen youths he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) drags alive to land; With their rich belts their captive arms restrains -LRB-Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains-RRB-.
<p/>, Sad victims destined to Patroclus' shade; Then, as once more he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) plunged amid the flood, The young Lycaon in his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) passage stood; The son of Priam; whom the hero's hand But late made captive in his (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) father's land -LRB-As from a sycamore, his (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) sounding steel Lopp'd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel-RRB-
<p/>To Lemnos' isle he (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) sold the royal slave, Where Jason's son the price demanded gave; But kind Eetion, touching on the shore, The ransom'd prince to fair Arisbe bore.
<p/>These his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) attendants to the ships convey'd Ten days were past, since in his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) father's reign He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) felt the sweets of liberty again;
<p/>The next, that god whom men in vain withstand Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand Now never to return! and doom'd to go A sadder journey to the shades below.
<p/>The helm and visor he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) had cast aside With wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) useless lance and unavailing shield,-RRB-
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) well-known face when great Achilles eyed, -LRB- As trembling, panting, from the stream he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) fled, And knock'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) faltering knees, the hero said.
<p/>'' Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view! Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue? Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans
<p/>kill'd Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field; As now the captive, whom so late I bound And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!
<p/>Not him (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) the sea's unmeasured deeps detain, That bar such numbers from their native plain; Lo! he (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) returns. Try, then, my flying spear!
<p/>Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer; If earth, at length this active prince can seize, Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules.
<p/>Thus while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) spoke, the Trojan pale with fears Approach'd, and sought his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) knees with suppliant tears Loth as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) was to yield his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) youthful breath, And his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) soul shivering at the approach of death.
<p/>Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound; He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) kiss'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) feet, extended on the ground: And while, above, the spear suspended stood, Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood, One hand embraced them close,
<p/>'' one stopp'd the dart, While thus these melting words attempt his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) heart: ``Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see, Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.
<p/>Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore, Far from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) father, friends, and native shore; A hundred oxen were his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) price that day,
<p/>Some pity to a suppliant's name afford, Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board; Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.
<p/>Scarce respited from woes I yet appear, And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here; Lo! Jove again submits me to thy hands, Again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) victim cruel Fate demands!
<p/>I sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair, -LRB-Old Altes' daughter, and Lelegia's heir; Who held in Pedasus his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) famed abode, And ruled the fields where silver Satnio flow'd,-RRB-
<p/>Two sons -LRB-alas! unhappy sons-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bore; For ah! one spear shall drink each brother's gore, And I succeed to slaughter'd Polydore.
<p/>How from that arm of terror shall I fly? Some demon urges! ' tis my doom to die! If ever yet soft pity touch'd thy mind, Ah! think not me too much of Hector's kind!
<p/>These words, attended with a shower of tears, The youth address'd to unrelenting ears: <div class="bookquote">``Talk not of life, or ransom -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) replies-RRB-: Patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies: In vain a single Trojan sues for grace;
<p/>Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath, With his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>), who wrought thy loved Patroclus' death. ''  (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div>But least, the sons of Priam's hateful race.
<p/>Die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore? The great, the good Patroclus is no more! He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), far thy better, was foredoom'd to die, And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?
<p/>Seest thou not me, whom nature's gifts adorn, Sprung from a hero, from a goddess born? The day shall come -LRB-which nothing can avert-RRB-
<p/>When by the spear, the arrow, or the dart, By night, or day, by force, or by design, Impending death and certain fate are mine!
<p/>Die then,''--He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) said; and as the word he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) spoke, The fainting stripling sank before the stroke: His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear, While all his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) trembling frame confess'd his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) fear: Sudden, Achilles his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) broad sword display'd, And buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) neck the reeking blade.
<p/>Prone fell the youth; and panting on the land, The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand. The victor to the stream the carcase gave, And thus insults him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>), floating on the wave:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround Thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound : There no sad mother shall thy funerals weep, But swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,

<p/>Such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine. What boots ye now Scamander's worshipp'd stream, His (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) earthly honours, and immortal name? In vain your immolated bulls are slain, Your living coursers glut his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) gulfs in vain!
<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) rewards you, with this bitter fate; Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete: Thus is atoned Patroclus' honour'd shade, And the short absence of Achilles paid.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>These boastful words provoked the raging god; With fury swells the violated flood. What means divine may yet the power employ To check Achilles, and to rescue Troy?
<p/>Meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare The great Asteropeus to mortal war; The son of Pelagon, whose lofty line Flows from the source of Axius, stream divine!
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fearless stood, And shook two spears, advancing from the flood; The flood impell'd him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), on Pelides' head To avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) waters choked with heaps of dead.
<p/>-LRB-Fair Peribaea's love the god had crown'd, With all his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) refluent waters circled round:-RRB- On him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) Achilles rush'd Near as they drew, Achilles thus began: <div class="bookquote">``What art thou, boldest of the race of man?

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Threatening he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said: the hostile chiefs advance; At once Asteropeus discharged each lance, -LRB-For both his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dexterous hands the lance could wield,-RRB-
<p/>One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield; One razed Achilles' hand; the spouting blood Spun forth; in earth the fasten'd weapon stood.
<p/>Its erring fury hiss'd along the skies; Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear, Even to the middle earth; and quiver'd there.
<p/>Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies: Then from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) side the sword Pelides drew, And on his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) foe with double fury flew.
<p/>The foe thrice tugg'd, and shook the rooted wood; Repulsive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) might the weapon stood: The fourth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) tries to break the spear in vain;
<p/>Bent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>) stands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>) tumbles to the plain; His (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>) belly open'd with a ghastly wound, The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.
<p/>Beneath the hero's feet he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) panting lies, And his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) eye darkens, and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) spirit flies; While the proud victor thus triumphing said, His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) radiant armour tearing from the dead: <div class="bookquote">``So ends thy glory!
<p/>Such the fate they prove, Who strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove! Sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?

<p/>In valour matchless, and in force divine! If Jove have given thee every Trojan head, 'Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.
<p/>See! my choked streams no more their course can keep, Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep. Turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood; Content, thy slaughters could amaze a god.
<p/>'' In human form, confess'd before his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) eyes, The river thus; and thus the chief replies: <div class="bookquote">``O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;
<p/>Shall pant, and tremble at our arms again; Not till proud Hector, guardian of her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) wall, Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall.

<p/>Was not the mandate of the sire above Full and express, that Phoebus should employ His (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) sacred arrows in defence of Troy, And make her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) conquer, till Hyperion's fall In awful darkness hide the face of all?
<p/>Then to the godhead of the silver bow The yellow flood began: <div class="bookquote">``O son of Jove! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) spoke in vain--
<p/>Then rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rage above the shores, From all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) deep the bellowing river roars, Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast, And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss'd.
<p/>The chief without dismay Ploughs through the boiling surge his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) desperate way. While all before, the billows ranged on high, -LRB-A watery bulwark,-RRB- screen the bands who fly.
<p/>Now bursting on his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) head with thundering sound, The falling deluge whelms the hero round: His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) loaded shield bends to the rushing tide; His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide, Sliddering, and staggering.
<p/>On the border stood A spreading elm, that overhung the flood; He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) seized a bending bough, his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) steps to stay; The plant uprooted to his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) weight gave way.-LRB-270-RRB-
<p/>Heaving the bank, and undermining all; Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display'd Bridged the rough flood across: the hero
<p/>stay'd On this his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) weight, and raised upon his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) hand, Leap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land. Then blacken'd the wild waves: the murmur rose:
<p/>The god pursues, a huger billow throws, And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.
<p/>Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs; At every bound his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) clanging armour rings: Now here, now there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) turns on every side, And winds his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) course before the following tide; The waves flow after,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) like the warlike eagle speeds his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) pace -LRB-Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race-RRB-; wheresoe'er he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) wheels, And gather fast, and murmur at his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) heels.
<p/>So when a peasant to his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) garden brings Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs, And calls the floods from high, to bless his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) bowers, And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:
<p/>And marks the future current with his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) spade, Swift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills, Louder and louder purl the falling rills; Before him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) scattering, they prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) pains, And shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.
<p/>Soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) clears whate'er their passage stay'd, Still flies Achilles, but before his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) eyes Still swift Scamander rolls where'er he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) flies: Not all his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) speed escapes the rapid floods; The first of men, but not a match for gods.
<p/>Oft as he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) turn'd the torrent to oppose, And bravely try if all the powers were foes; So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread, Beats on his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) back, or bursts upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) head.
<p/>Tired by the tides, his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) knees relax with toil; Wash'd from beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) slides the slimy soil; When thus -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) eyes on heaven's expansion thrown-RRB-
<p/>Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) braves, And still indignant bounds above the waves. Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:

<p/>, He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) springs impetuous, and invades the field: O'er all the expanded plain the waters spread; Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead, Floating `midst scatter'd arms; while casques of gold And turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.
<p/>High o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds, He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds. Not a whole river stops the hero's course, While Pallas fills him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) with immortal force.
<p/>Haste, my brother flood; And check this mortal that controls a god; Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight, And Ilion tumble from her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) towery height.
<p/>Call then thy subject streams, and bid them roar, From all thy fountains swell thy watery store, With broken rocks, and with a load of dead, Charge the black surge, and pour it on his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) head.
<p/>With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars, And lifts his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) billows, and o'erwhelms his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) shores. Then thus to Simois!

<p/>Then, murmuring from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) beds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) boils, he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) raves, And Fear touch'd the queen of heaven : she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) saw dismay'd, She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) call'd aloud, and summon'd Vulcan's aid.

<p/>The power ignipotent her (<font color='blue'><b>thy</b></font>) word obeys: Wide o'er the plain he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) pours the boundless blaze; At once consumes the dead, and dries the soil
<p/>And the shrunk waters in their channel boil. As when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky, And instant blows the water'd gardens dry:
<p/>Swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys; Along the margin winds the running blaze: The trees in flaming rows to ashes turn, The flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn, Broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire; The watery willows hiss before the fire.
<p/>So look'd the field, so whiten'd was the ground, While Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around. Now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath, The eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:
<p/>Now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry, Or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky. At length the river rear'd

<p/>The waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires: So boils the imprison'd flood, forbid to flow, And choked with vapours feels his (<font color='blue'><b>pant</b></font>) bottom glow.

<p/>Hecuba joins her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) entreaties, but in vain. Achilles pursues him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning the fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stands the combat, and is slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) chariot in the sight of Priam and Hecuba.
<p/>Their cries reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into the inner part of the palace: she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) mounts up to the walls, and beholds her (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) dead husband.

<p/>Beneath a turret, on his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) shield reclined, He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) stood, and question'd thus his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) mighty mind:-LRB-275-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?

<p/>As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise, Struck by some god, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fears, recedes, and flies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) leaves the gates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) leaves the wall behind: Achilles follows like the winged wind.
<p/>Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies -LRB-The swiftest racer of the liquid skies-RRB-, Just when he (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) holds, or thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) holds his (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) prey, Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way, With open beak and shrilling cries he (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) springs, And aims his (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) claws, and shoots upon his (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) wings: No less fore-right the rapid chase they held, One urged by fury, one by fear impell'd:
<p/>Now circling round the walls their course maintain, Where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain; Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad, -LRB-A wider compass,-RRB- smoke along the road.
<p/>Next by Scamander's double source they bound, Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground; This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise, With exhalations steaming to the skies; That the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows, Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows: Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills, Whose polish'd bed receives the falling rills; Where Trojan dames -LRB-ere yet alarm'd by Greece-RRB- Wash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.-LRB-276-RRB-
<p/>Swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play, No vulgar victim must reward the day: -LRB-Such as in races crown the speedy strife:-RRB-
<p/>By these they pass'd, one chasing, one in flight: -LRB-The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:-RRB- The prize contended was great Hector's life.
<p/>As when some hero's funerals are decreed In grateful honour of the mighty dead; Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame -LRB-Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame-RRB-
<p/>The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal, And with them turns the raised spectator's soul: Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.
<p/>The gazing gods lean forward from the sky; To whom, while eager on the chase they look, The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:
<p/>Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain, Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy, From Ida's summits, and the towers of Troy: Now see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) flying; to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) fears resign'd, And fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.

<p/>As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace, One to pursue, and one to lead the chase, Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake, Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake: No less the labouring heroes pant and strain:

<p/>Jove lifts the golden balances, that show The fates of mortal men, and things below: Here each contending hero's lot he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) tries, And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.
<p/>What god, O muse, assisted Hector's force With fate itself so long to hold the course? Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector's fate; Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.
<p/>Then Phoebus left him (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>). Fierce Minerva flies To stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries: <div class="bookquote">``O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease, And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.

<p/>the meditated blow: He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stoop'd, while o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) head the flying spear Sang innocent, and spent its force in air. Minerva watch'd
<p/>it falling on the land, Then drew, and gave to great Achilles' hand, Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy , Now shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) lance, and braves the dread of Troy.

<p/>I shall not fall a fugitive at least, My soul shall bravely issue from my breast. But first, try thou my arm; and may this dart End all my country's woes, deep buried in thy heart.
<p/>'' The weapon flew, its course unerring held, Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell'd The mortal dart; resulting with a bound From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.
<p/>Hector beheld his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) javelin fall in vain, Nor other lance, nor other hope remain; He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) calls Deiphobus, demands a spear-- In vain, for no Deiphobus was there.
<p/>All comfortless he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) stands: then, with a sigh; '''Tis so--Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh! I deem'd Deiphobus had heard my call, But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) secure lies guarded in the wall.

<p/>Then welcome fate! ' Tis true I perish, yet I perish great: Yet in a mighty deed I shall expire, Let future ages hear it, and admire!''
<p/>Fierce, at the word, his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) weighty sword he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) drew, And, all collected, on Achilles flew. So Jove's bold bird, high balanced in the air, Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.
<p/>Nor less Achilles his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) fierce soul prepares: Before his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) breast the flaming shield he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) bears, Refulgent orb! above his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) fourfold cone
<p/>The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun. Nodding at every step: -LRB-Vulcanian frame!-RRB- And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) moved, his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) figure seem'd on flame.
<p/>As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,-LRB-277-RRB- Far-beaming o'er the silver host of night, When all the starry train emblaze the sphere
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) right hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) waves the weapon round, Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound; But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore Securely cased the warrior's body o'er.

<p/>After the funeral feast he (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep, the ghost of his (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) friend appears to him (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), and demands the rites of burial; the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood for the pyre.
<p/>Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. The funeral procession, and the offering their hair to the dead.
<p/>Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly twelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) pays libations to the Winds, which -LRB-at the instance of Iris-RRB- rise, and raise the flames.
<p/>When the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones, place them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb.
<p/>Achilles institutes the funeral games: the chariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the wrestling, the foot-race, the single combat, the discus, the shooting with arrows, the darting the javelin: the various descriptions of which, and the various success of the several antagonists, make the greatest part of the book.
<p/>The night following, the ghost of Patroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in felling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth in burning it; and the three-and-thirtieth in the games.
<p/>In this book ends the thirtieth day. The scene is generally on the sea-shore. Thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train Through the sad city
<p/>The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand, All, but the martial Myrmidonian band: These yet assembled great Achilles holds, And the stern purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) mind unfolds: <div class="bookquote">``Not yet, my brave companions of the war, Release your smoking coursers from the car;
<p/>mourn'd her (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) hero slain. The body soil'd with dust, and black with gore, Lies on broad Hellespont's resounding shore. But, with his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) chariot each in order led, Perform due honours to Patroclus dead.

<p/>The attending heralds, as by office bound, With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround: To cleanse his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) conquering hands from hostile gore, They urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:-LRB-282-RRB-
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) dead friend the pensive warrior went, With steps unwilling, to the regal tent. '' No drop shall touch me, by almighty Jove!

<p/>'' Along the grass his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) languid members fall, When lo! the shade, before his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) closing eyes, Of sad Patroclus rose, or seem'd to rise:
<p/>In the same robe he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) living wore, he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) came: In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same. The form familiar hover'd

<p/>Confused he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wakes; amazement breaks the bands Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands, Pensive he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) muses with uplifted hands: '''Tis true, 'tis certain; man, though dead, retains Part of himself; the immortal mind remains: The form subsists without the body's aid, Aerial semblance, and an empty shade!
<p/>This night my friend, so late in battle lost, Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost: Even now familiar, as in life, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) came;
<p/>Like a thin smoke he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sees the spirit fly,-LRB-284-RRB- And hears a feeble, lamentable cry. Alas! how different! yet how like the same!''
<p/>Thus while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke, each eye grew big with tears: And now the rosy-finger'd morn appears, Shows every mournful face with tears o'erspread, And glares on the pale visage of the dead.
<p/>But Agamemnon, as the rites demand, With mules and waggons sends a chosen band To load the timber, and the pile to rear; A charge consign'd to Merion's faithful care.
<p/>With proper instruments they take the road, Axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load. First march the heavy mules, securely slow, O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go:-LRB-285-RRB-
<p/>Jumping, high o'er the shrubs of the rough ground, Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock'd axles bound But when arrived at Ida's spreading woods,-LRB-286-RRB-

<p/>Deep echoing groan the thickets brown; Then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down. The wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn; And the slow mules the same rough road return
<p/>The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore -LRB-Such charge was given them-RRB- to the sandy shore; There on the spot which great Achilles show'd, They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load; Circling around the place, where times to come
<p/>The hero bids his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) martial troops appear High on their cars in all the pomp of war; Each in refulgent arms his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) limbs attires
<p/>Shall view Patroclus' and Achilles' tomb. , All mount their chariots, combatants and squires. The chariots first proceed, a shining train;
<p/>Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain; Next these the melancholy band appear; Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier; O'er all the corse their scattered locks they throw; Achilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe, Supporting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) hands the hero's head, Bends o'er the extended body of the dead.
<p/>But great Achilles stands apart in prayer, And from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) head divides the yellow hair; Those curling locks which from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) youth he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) vow'd,-LRB-287-RRB-
<p/>Patroclus decent on the appointed ground They place, and heap the sylvan pile around. And sacred grew, to Sperchius' honour'd flood:
<p/>Then sighing, to the deep his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) locks he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) cast, And roll'd his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) eyes around the watery waste: <div class="bookquote">``Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost Delightful roll along my native coast!

<p/>Nor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies, Smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise; But, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer, Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air, And victims promised, and libations cast, To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) shone amidst them, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>) painted bow; The rocky pavement glitter'd with the show. All from the banquet rise, and each invites The various goddess to partake the rites.

<p/>The morning planet told the approach of light; And, fast behind, Aurora's warmer ray O'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day: Then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn'd, And to their caves the whistling winds return'd: Across the Thracian seas their course they bore;
<p/>Then parting from the pile he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) ceased to weep, And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep, Exhausted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) grief: meanwhile the crowd Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood; The tumult waked him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>): from his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) shook Unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:

<p/>The second victor claims a mare unbroke, Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke: The third, a charger yet untouch'd by flame; Four ample measures held the shining frame: Two golden talents for the fourth were placed: An ample double bowl contents the last.
<p/>These in fair order ranged upon the plain, The hero, rising, thus address'd the train: <div class="bookquote">``Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed To the brave rulers of the racing steed
<p/>; Prizes which none beside ourself could gain, Should our immortal coursers take the plain; -LRB-A race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god Peleus received, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) son bestow'd.-RRB-
<p/>But this no time our vigour to display; Nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day: Lost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck Their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.
<p/>Sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand, And trail those graceful honours on the sand! Let others for the noble task prepare, Who trust the courser and the flying car.
<p/>Fired at his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) word the rival racers rise; But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize, Famed though Pieria for the fleetest breed, And skill'd to manage the high-bounding steed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The hero</b></font>)</div>With equal ardour bold Tydides swell'd, The steeds of Tros beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) yoke compell'd -LRB- Which late obey'd the Dardan chiefs command,
<p/>Then Menelaus his (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) Podargus brings, And the famed courser of the king of kings: Whom rich Echepolus -LRB-more rich than brave-RRB-, To `scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave, -LRB-Ćthe her (<font color='blue'><b>Menelaus</b></font>) name-RRB- at home to end his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) days; Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.
<p/>When scarce a god redeem'd him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) hand-RRB-. Next him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) Antilochus demands the course With beating heart, and cheers his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) Pylian horse.
<p/>Experienced Nestor gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) son the reins, Directs his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) judgment, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) heat restrains; Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears The prudent son with unattending ears.
<p/>My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast, The gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless'd; Neptune and Jove on thee conferr'd the skill Swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.
<p/>Fear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known; Compare those rivals' judgment and thy own: It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize, And to be swift is less than to be wise. '
<p/>'' To guide thy conduct little precept needs; But slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds. Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes
<p/>The dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks; By art the pilot, through the boiling deep And howling tempest, steers the fearless ship; And 'tis the artist wins the glorious course; Not those who trust in chariots and in horse.
<p/>In vain, unskilful to the goal they strive, And short, or wide, the ungovern'd courser drive: While with sure skill, though with inferior steeds, The knowing racer to his (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) end proceeds; Fix'd on the goal his (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) eye foreruns the course, His (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) hand unerring steers the steady horse, And now contracts, or now extends the rein, Observing still the foremost on the plain.
<p/>Mark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found; Yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground; Of some once stately oak the last remains, Or hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains:
<p/>Inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar; And round, a circle for the wheeling car. -LRB-Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace; Or then, as now, the limit of a race.-RRB-
<p/>Bear close to this, and warily proceed, A little bending to the left-hand steed; But urge the right, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Yon</b></font>) all the reins; While thy strict hand his (<font color='blue'><b>Yon</b></font>) fellow's head restrains, And turns him (<font color='blue'><b>Yon</b></font>) short; till, doubling as they roll, The wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.
<p/>Clear of the stony heap direct the course; Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be A joy to others, a reproach to me.
<p/>So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind, And leave unskilful swiftness far behind: Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed; Or the famed race, through all the regions known, That whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon.
<p/>Yet -LRB-not to break the car, or lame the horse-RRB- '' Thus -LRB-nought unsaid-RRB- the much-advising sage Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.
<p/>Next bold Meriones was seen to rise, The last, but not least ardent for the prize. They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose -LRB-Roll'd in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) helmet, these Achilles throws-RRB-.
<p/>Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then; And next the brother of the king of men: Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast; And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.
<p/>They stand in order, an impatient train: Pelides points the barrier on the plain, And sends before old Phoenix to the place, To mark the racers, and to judge the race.
<p/>At once the coursers from the barrier bound; The lifted scourges all at once resound; Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;
<p/>And up the champaign thunder from the shore: Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise, And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies; Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined, Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:
<p/>The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound, Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground. While hot for fame, and conquest all their care, -LRB-Each o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) flying courser hung in air,-RRB-
<p/>Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein , They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain. Now -LRB-the last compass fetch'd around the goal-RRB-
<p/>At the near prize each gathers all his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) soul, Each burns with double hope, with double pain, Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.
<p/>First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds; With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds: Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind, And seem just mounting on his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) car behind;
<p/>Then had he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) lost, or left a doubtful prize; But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies, Strikes from his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) hand the scourge, and renders vain His (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) matchless horses' labour on the plain.
<p/>Full on his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) neck he (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) feels the sultry breeze, And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees. Rage fills his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) eye with anguish, to survey Snatch'd from his (<font color='blue'><b>manes</b></font>) hope the glories of the day.
<p/>The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain, Springs to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) knight, and gives the scourge again, And fills his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) steeds with vigour.
<p/>At a stroke She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rival's chariot from the yoke: No more their way the startled horses held; The car reversed came rattling on the field;
<p/>Shot headlong from his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) seat, beside the wheel, Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell; His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) batter'd face and elbows strike the ground
<p/>; Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound: Grief stops his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) voice, a torrent drowns his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes: Before him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) far the glad Tydides flies; Minerva's spirit drives his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) matchless pace, And crowns him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) victor of the labour'd race.
<p/>The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds; While thus young Nestor animates his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) steeds: <div class="bookquote">``Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force; Not that we hope to match Tydides' horse, Since great Minerva wings their rapid way, And gives their lord the honours of the day; But reach Atrides!
<p/>shall his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) mare outgo Your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe? Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain The last ignoble gift be all we gain,
<p/>No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply, The old man's fury rises, and ye die. Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight, Presents the occasion, could we use it right.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Nestor/Wise Nestor/Wise</b></font>)</div>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The coursers at their master's threat With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat. And now Antilochus with nice survey Observes the compass of the hollow way. '
<p/>Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn, Fast by the road a precipice was worn: Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng The Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.
<p/>Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep, Still edging near, and bears him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) toward the steep. Atrides, trembling, casts his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) eye below, And wonders at the rashness of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) foe.
<p/>'' Hold, stay your steeds-- What madness thus to ride This narrow way! take larger field -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) cried-RRB-, Or both must fall.''--Atrides cried in vain; He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.
<p/>Far as an able arm the disk can send, When youthful rivals their full force extend, So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew Before the king: he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), cautious, backward drew His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) horse compell'd; foreboding in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fears The rattling ruin of the clashing cars, The floundering coursers rolling on the plain, And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.
<p/>But thus upbraids his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) rival as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) flies: <div class="bookquote">``Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise! Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign; Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine--
<p/>Your rivals, destitute of youthful force, With fainting knees shall labour in the course, And yield the glory yours.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--The steeds obey; Already at their heels they wing their way, And seem already to retrieve the day.
<p/>'' Then to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) steeds with all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) force he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cries, ``Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize! Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld
<p/>them was the Cretan king; High on a rising ground, above the ring, The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey He (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) well observed the chief who led the way, And heard from far his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) animating cries, And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes
<p/>The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field. The first who mark'd ; On whose broad front a blaze of shining white, Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.

<p/>Perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand, And, turn'd too short, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) tumbled on the strand, Shot from the chariot; while his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) coursers stray With frantic fury from the destined way.
<p/>Rise then some other, and inform my sight, For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right ; Yet sure he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) seems, to judge by shape and air, The great Ćtolian chief, renown'd in war.
<p/>Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize; Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed, Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.
<p/>Eumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase, Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race: I well discern him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) shakes the rein, And hear his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) shouts victorious o'er the plain.

<p/>High o'er his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) head the circling lash he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wields: His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) bounding horses scarcely touch the fields: So swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.
<p/>Now victor at the goal Tydides stands, Quits his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) bright car, and springs upon the sands; From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream; The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam: With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,
<p/>The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes: These to the ships his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) train triumphant leads, The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.
<p/>Young Nestor follows -LRB-who by art, not force, O'erpass'd Atrides-RRB- second in the course. Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near Than to the courser in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) swift career

<p/>Rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand, The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand; And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.

<p/>Joy swells his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) soul: as when the vernal grain Lifts the green ear above the springing plain, The fields their vegetable life renew, And laugh and glitter with the morning dew; Such joy the Spartan's shining face o'erspread, And lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) gay heart, while thus he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Still may our souls, O generous youth!

<p/>As a large fish, when winds and waters roar, By some huge billow dash'd against the shore, Lies panting; not less batter'd with his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) wound, The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.
<p/>To rear his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) fallen foe, the victor lends, Scornful, his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) hand; and gives him (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) friends; Whose arms support him (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>), reeling through the throng, And dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) disabled legs along; Nodding, his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) head hangs down his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) shoulder o'er; His (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;-LRB-292-RRB- Wrapp'd round in mists he (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) lies, and lost to thought; His (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.

<p/>A massy tripod for the victor lies, Of twice six oxen its reputed price; And next, the loser's spirits to restore, A female captive, valued but at four.
<p/>Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose. Amid the ring each nervous rival stands, Embracing rigid with implicit hands.
<p/>Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd; Like two strong rafters which the builder forms, Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms, Their tops connected, but at wider space Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.
<p/>Now to the grasp each manly body bends; The humid sweat from every pore descends; Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.
<p/>Nor could Ulysses, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) art renown'd, O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground; Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow The watchful caution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) artful foe.
<p/>Close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd: While the long strife even tired the lookers on, Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me : Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lookers</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) said; and, straining, heaved him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) off the ground With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) ankle struck: the giant fell supine; Ulysses, following, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) bosom lies; Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.
<p/>Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays; He (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) barely stirr'd him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) could not raise: His (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied; And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.
<p/>Defiled with honourable dust they roll, Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul: Again they rage, again to combat rise; When great Achilles thus divides the prize: <div class="bookquote">``Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain; Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.
<p/>Ye both have won: let others who excel, Now prove that prowess you have proved so well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Achilles</b></font>)</div>The hero's words the willing chiefs obey, From their tired bodies
<p/>The youths contending in the rapid race: A silver urn that full six measures held, By none in weight or workmanship excell'd: Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine, Elaborate, with artifice divine; Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport, And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port: From him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) descended
<p/>wipe the dust away, And, clothed anew, the following games survey. And now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace , good Eunaeus heir'd
<p/>The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared, To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward: Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace, It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.
<p/>A well-fed ox was for the second placed; And half a talent must content the last. Achilles rising then bespoke the train:
<p/>The hero said, and starting from his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) place, Oilean Ajax rises to the race; Ulysses next; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) whose speed surpass'd His (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) youthful equals, Nestor's son, the last.
<p/>Ranged in a line the ready racers stand; Pelides points the barrier with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) hand; All start at once; Oileus led the race; The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace; Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>), diligently close, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) sped, As closely following as the running thread
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain, Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The spindle follows, and displays the charms Of the fair spinster's breast and moving arms:
<p/>Graceful in motion thus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) foe he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) plies, And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise; His (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) glowing breath upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) shoulders plays
<p/>: The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise: To him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes, And send their souls before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) flies.
<p/>Now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal, The panting chief to Pallas lifts his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) soul: <div class="bookquote">``Assist, O goddess!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pallas</b></font>)</div>thus in thought he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) pray'd!
<p/>And present at his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) thought descends the maid. Buoy'd by her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heavenly force, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) seems to swim, And feels a pinion lifting every limb.
<p/>All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain, Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain -LRB-O'erturn'd by Pallas-RRB-, where the slippery shore Was clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.
<p/>-LRB-The self-same place beside Patroclus' pyre, Where late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.-RRB- Besmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,
<p/>Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay; The well-fed bull -LRB-the second prize-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>racer</b></font>) shared, And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.
<p/>Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast, The baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd: ``Accursed fate! the conquest I forego; A mortal I
<p/>, a goddess was my foe; She (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) urged her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) favourite on the rapid way, And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day.
<p/>Antilochus, more humorous than the rest, Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest: <div class="bookquote">``Why with our wiser elders should we strive?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Antilochus</b></font>)</div>Thus sourly wail'd he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>), sputtering dirt and gore; A burst of laughter echoed through the shore. The gods still love them, and they always thrive.
<p/>Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize: He (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) to Ulysses, still more aged and wise; -LRB-A green old age unconscious of decays, That proves the hero born in better days!-RRB-
<p/>Behold his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) vigour in this active race! Achilles only boasts a swifter pace: For who can match Achilles? He (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) who can, Must yet be more than hero, more than man.
<p/>'' The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries, <div class="bookquote">``Thy artful praise deserves a better prize. Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;
<p/>Receive a talent of the purest gold. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The youth</b></font>)</div>The youth departs content. The host admire The son of Nestor, worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) sire.
<p/>Next these a buckler, spear, and helm , he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) brings; Cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings: Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore, And great Patroclus in short triumph bore.
<p/>Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize, Now grace the lists before our army's sight, And sheathed in steel, provoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) foe to fight.
<p/>Who first the jointed armour shall explore, And stain his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) rival's mail with issuing gore, The sword Asteropaeus possess'd of old, -LRB-A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,-RRB-
<p/>Shall pay the stroke, and grace the striker's side: These arms in common let the chiefs divide: For each brave champion, when the combat ends, A sumptuous banquet at our tents attends.
<p/>'' Stand forth the bravest of our host! -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) cries-RRB- '' Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus' son, And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.
<p/>Clad in refulgent steel, on either hand, The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand; Louring they meet, tremendous to the sight; Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.
<p/>Opposed in arms not long they idly stood, But thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd. A furious pass the spear of Ajax made Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.
<p/>Not thus the foe: his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) javelin aim'd above The buckler's margin, at the neck he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) drove.

<p/>-LSB-Illustration: CERES.-RSB- CERES. BOOK XXIV. ARGUMENT. THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR. The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector's body.
<p/>Jupiter sends Thetis to Achilles, to dispose him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) for the restoring it, and Iris to Priam, to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) to go in person and treat for it.
<p/>The old king, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) queen, makes ready for the journey, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sets forth in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the charge of Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young man, and conducts him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the pavilion of Achilles.
<p/>Priam finds Achilles at his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) table, casts himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) feet, and begs for the body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) son: Achilles, moved with compassion, grants his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) request, detains him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) one night in his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) tent, and the next morning sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) home with the body: the Trojans run out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>).
<p/>The time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of Hector lies in the tent of Achilles; and as many more are spent in the truce allowed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) interment.
<p/>Their conversation on the way. The lamentations of Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the solemnities of the funeral. The scene is partly in Achilles' camp, and partly in Troy.
<p/>Now from the finish'd games the Grecian band Seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand, All stretch'd at ease the genial banquet share, And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>), to grief resign'd, His (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) friend's dear image present to his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) mind, Takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) sad couch, more unobserved to weep; Nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.
<p/>The form so pleasing, and the heart so kind, That youthful vigour, and that manly mind, What toils they shared, what martial works they wrought, What seas they measured, and what fields they fought;
<p/>Not so Achilles: Restless he (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) roll'd around his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) weary bed, And all his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) soul on his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) Patroclus fed: All pass'd before him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) in remembrance dear, Thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.
<p/>And now supine, now prone, the hero lay, Now shifts his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) side, impatient for the day: Then starting up, disconsolate he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) goes Wide on the lonely beach to vent his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) woes.
<p/>There as the solitary mourner raves, The ruddy morning rises o'er the waves: Soon as it rose, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) furious steeds he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) join'd!
<p/>The chariot flies, and Hector trails behind. And thrice, Patroclus! round thy monument Was Hector dragg'd, then hurried to the tent.
<p/>While foul in dust the unhonour'd carcase lies, But not deserted by the pitying skies: For Phoebus watch'd it with superior care, Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air;
<p/>There sleep at last o'ercomes the hero's eyes; And, ignominious as it swept the field, Spread o'er the sacred corse his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) golden shield.
<p/>But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies, And th' unrelenting empress of the skies, E'er since that day implacable to Troy, What time young Paris, simple shepherd boy, Won by destructive lust -LRB-reward obscene-RRB-
<p/>All heaven was moved, and Hermes will'd to go By stealth to snatch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from the insulting foe: , Their charms rejected for the Cyprian queen.
<p/>But when the tenth celestial morning broke, To heaven assembled, thus Apollo spoke: -LSB-Illustration: HECTOR'S BODY AT THE CAR OF ACHILLES.-RSB-
<p/>HECTOR'S BODY AT THE CAR OF ACHILLES. '' Unpitying powers! how oft each holy fane Has Hector tinged with blood of victims slain?
<p/>And can ye still his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) cold remains pursue? Still grudge his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) body to the Trojans' view? Deny to consort, mother, son, and sire, The last sad honours of a funeral fire?
<p/>Is then the dire Achilles all your care? That iron heart, inflexibly severe; A lion, not a man, who slaughters wide,
<p/>In strength of rage, and impotence of pride; Who hastes to murder with a savage joy, Invades around, and breathes but to destroy!
<p/>Still for one loss he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rages unresign'd, Repugnant to the lot of all mankind; To lose a friend, a brother, or a son, Heaven dooms each mortal, and its will is done:
<p/>Shame is not of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) soul; nor understood, The greatest evil and the greatest good. Awhile they sorrow, then dismiss their care; Fate gives the wound, and man is born to bear.
<p/>But this insatiate, the commission given By fate exceeds, and tempts the wrath of heaven: Lo, how his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rage dishonest drags along Hector's dead earth, insensible of wrong!
<p/>Brave though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) be, yet by no reason awed, He (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) violates the laws of man and god. '' -LSB-Illustration: THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.-RSB-

<p/>Great Jove beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) cross'd the plain, And felt the woes of miserable man. Then thus to Hermes: ''

<p/>We have now passed through the Iliad, and seen the anger of Achilles, and the terrible effects of it, at an end, as that only was the subject of the poem, and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war, it perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader to give a short account of what happened to Troy and the chief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it.
<p/>I need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death of Hector by the stratagem of the wooden horse, the particulars of which are described by Virgil in the second book of the Ćneid.
<p/>Achilles fell before Troy, by the hand of Paris, by the shot of an arrow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) heel, as Hector had prophesied at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) death, lib.
<p/>Such honours Ilion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) hero paid, And peaceful slept the mighty Hector's shade.-LRB-300-RRB- CONCLUDING NOTE. xxii. The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.
<p/>Ajax, after the death of Achilles, had a contest with Ulysses for the armour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) aim, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) slew himself through indignation.
<p/>Helen, after the death of Paris, married Deiphobus his (<font color='blue'><b>Ulysses</b></font>) brother, and at the taking of Troy betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), in order to reconcile herself to Menelaus her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) first husband, who received her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) again into favour.
<p/>Agamemnon at his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) return was barbarously murdered by Ćgysthus, at the instigation of Clytemnestra his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) wife, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) absence had dishonoured his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) bed with Ćgysthus.
<p/>Diomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) own country, and scarce escaped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) life from his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) adulterous wife Ćgiale; but at last was received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) kingdom; it is uncertain how he (<font color='blue'><b>Agamemnon</b></font>) died.
<p/>Ulysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea and land, at last returned in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of Homer's Odyssey.
<p/>For what remains, I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking leave at the end of my work, and from embarrassing myself, or others, with any defences or apologies about it.
<p/>But instead of endeavouring to raise a vain monument to myself, of the merits or difficulties of it -LRB-which must be left to the world, to truth, and to posterity-RRB-, let me leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable of men, as well as finest writers, of my age and country, one who has tried, and knows by his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) own experience, how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to Homer, and one whom -LRB-I am sure-RRB- sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my labours.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>), therefore, having brought this long work to a conclusion, I desire to dedicate it, and to have the honour and satisfaction of placing together, in this manner, the names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of March 25, 1720 A.

<p/>Mr. Mackenzie has given three brief but elaborate papers on the different writers on the subject, which deserve to be consulted.
<p/>Gr. v. II t. ii. See Notes and Queries, vol. v. pp. 99, 171, and 221. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mackenzie</b></font>) own views are moderate, and perhaps as satisfactory, on the whole, as any of the hypotheses hitherto put forth.
<p/>In fact, they consist in an attempt to blend those hypotheses into something like consistency, rather than in advocating any individual theory.
<p/>23 Letters to Phileleuth; Lips. 24 Hist. of Greece, vol. ii. p. 191, sqq. 25 It is, indeed not easy to calculate the height to which the memory may be cultivated.
<p/>To take an ordinary case, we might refer to that of any first rate actor, who must be prepared, at a very short warning, to `rhapsodize,' night after night, parts which when laid together, would amount to an immense number of lines.
<p/>Visiting at Naples a gentleman of the highest intellectual attainments, and who held a distinguished rank among the men of letters in the last century, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) informed us that the day before he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had passed much time in examining a man, not highly educated, who had learned to repeat the whole Gierusalemme of Tasso, not only to recite it consecutively, but also to repeat those stanzas in utter defiance of the sense, either forwards or backwards, or from the eighth line to the first, alternately the odd and even lines--in short, whatever the passage required; the memory, which seemed to cling to the words much more than to the sense, had it at such perfect command, that it could produce it under any form.
<p/>Our informant went on to state that this singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando Furioso in the same manner.
<p/>But even this instance is less wonderful than one as to which we may appeal to any of our readers that happened some twenty years ago to visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland.
<p/>No such person can have forgotten the poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who could actually repeat, after a few minutes consideration any verse required from any part of the Bible--even the obscurest and most unimportant enumeration of mere proper names not excepted.
<p/>We do not mention these facts as touching the more difficult part of the question before us, but facts they are; and if we find so much difficulty in calculating the extent to which the mere memory may be cultivated, are we, in these days of multifarious reading, and of countless distracting affairs, fair judges of the perfection to which the invention and the memory combined may attain in a simpler age, and among a more single minded people?--Quarterly Review, l. c., p. 143, sqq.
<p/>Heeren steers between the two opinions, observing that, <div class="bookquote">``The Dschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer in length, as much as it stands beneath them in merit, and yet it exists only in the memory of a people which is not unacquainted with writing.

<p/>The following argument of the Iliad, corrected in a few particulars, is translated from Bitaube, and is, perhaps, the neatest summary that has ever been drawn up:--``A hero, injured by his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) general, and animated with a noble resentment, retires to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) tent; and for a season withdraws himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) troops from the war.
<p/>During this interval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful termination of which the honour of their country depends.
<p/>The general, at length opening his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) eyes to the fault which he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had committed, deputes the principal officers of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) army to the incensed hero, with commission to make compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent presents.
<p/>The hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) character, persists in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) animosity; the army is again defeated, and is on the verge of entire destruction.
<p/>This inexorable man has a friend; this friend weeps before him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and asks for the hero's arms, and for permission to go to the war in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) stead.
<p/>39 Hesiod. Opp. et Dier. Lib. I. vers. 155, &c. 40 The eloquence of friendship prevails more than the intercession of the ambassadors or the gifts of the general.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) lends his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) armour to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) friend, but commands him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) not to engage with the chief of the enemy's army, because he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) reserves to himself the honour of that combat, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) also fears for his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) friend's life.
<p/>The prohibition is forgotten; the friend listens to nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) courage; his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) corpse is brought back to the hero, and the hero's arms become the prize of the conqueror.
<p/>Then the hero, given up to the most lively despair, prepares to fight; he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) receives from a divinity new armour, is reconciled with his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) general and, thirsting for glory and revenge, enacts prodigies of valour, recovers the victory, slays the enemy's chief, honours his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) friend with superb funeral rites, and exercises a cruel vengeance on the body of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) destroyer; but finally appeased by the tears and prayers of the father of the slain warrior, restores to the old man the corpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) buries with due solemnities.'--Coleridge, p. 177, sqq.
<p/>Pope is more accurate than the poet he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) translates, for Homer writes ``a prey to dogs and to all kinds of birds.
<p/>41 Vultures: But all kinds of birds are not carnivorous. 42 -- i.e. during the whole time of their striving the will of Jove was being gradually accomplished.

<p/>Of the gradual and individual development of Homer's heroes, Schlegel well observes, <div class="bookquote">``In bas-relief the figures are usually in profile, and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief; they are not grouped together, but follow one another; so Homer's heroes advance, one by one, in succession before us.
<p/>It has been remarked that the Iliad is not definitively closed, but that we are left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it.
<p/>The bas-relief is equally without limit, and may be continued ad infinitum, either from before or behind, on which account the ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite extension, sacrificial processions, dances, and lines of combatants, and hence they also exhibit bas-reliefs on curved surfaces, such as vases, or the frieze of a rotunda, where, by the curvature, the two ends are withdrawn from our sight, and where, while we advance, one object appears as another disappears.

<p/>97 Fresh water fowl, especially swans, were found in great numbers about the Asian Marsh, a fenny tract of country in Lydia, formed by the river Cayster, near its mouth.
<p/>Scamander, or Scamandros, was a river of Troas, rising, according to Strabo, on the highest part of Mount Ida, in the same hill with the Granicus and the OEdipus, and falling into the sea at Sigaeum; everything tends to identify it with Mendere, as Wood, Rennell, and others maintain; the Mendere is 40 miles long, 300 feet broad, deep in the time of flood, nearly dry in the summer.
<p/>Dr. Clarke successfully combats the opinion of those who make the Scamander to have arisen from the springs of Bounabarshy, and traces the source of the river to the highest mountain in the chain of Ida, now Kusdaghy; receives the Simois in its course; towards its mouth it is very muddy, and flows through marshes.
<p/>Between the Scamander and Simois, Homer's Troy is supposed to have stood: this river, according to Homer, was called Xanthus by the gods, Scamander by men.
<p/>The waters of the Scamander had the singular property of giving a beautiful colour to the hair or wool of such animals as bathed in them; hence the three goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus, bathed there before they appeared before Paris to obtain the golden apple: the name Xanthus, <div class="bookquote">``yellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Venus/VENUS</b></font>)</div>was given to the Scamander, from the peculiar colour of its waters, still applicable to the Mendere, the yellow colour of whose waters attracts the attention of travellers.

<p/>Although the example of Homer has since rendered some such formal enumeration of the forces engaged, a common practice in epic poems descriptive of great warlike adventures, still so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as imperatively required, nor perhaps such as would, in ordinary cases, suggest itself to the mind of a poet.

<p/>243 -- His (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) best beloved. The following elegant remarks of Thirlwall -LRB-Greece, vol. i, p. 176 seq.-RRB- well illustrate the character of the friendship subsisting between these two heroes--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of the noblest and most amiable sides of the Greek character, is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and durable friendships, and this is a feature no less prominent in the earliest than in later times.
<p/>It was indeed connected with the comparatively low estimation in which female society was held; but the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were maintained, was not the less admirable and engaging.
<p/>The heroic companions whom we find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in traditions which, if not of equal antiquity, were grounded on the same feeling, seem to have but one heart and soul, with scarcely a wish or object apart, and only to live as they are always ready to die for one another.
<p/>It is true that the relation between them is not always one of perfect equality; but this is a circumstance which, while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical description, detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it presents.
<p/>Such were the friendships of Hercules and Iolaus, of Theseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; and though These may owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the period to which the traditions are referred.
<p/>The argument of the Iliad mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus, whose love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) higher birth and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) unequalled prowess.
<p/>But the mutual regard which united Idomeneus and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus, though, as the persons themselves are less important, it is kept more in the back-ground, is manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light.
<p/>The idea of a Greek hero seems not to have been thought complete, without such a brother in arms by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) side.'' (<font color='red'><b>these heroes</b></font>)</div>--Thirlwall, Greece, vol.
<p/>i. p. 176, seq. 244 <div class="bookquote">``As hungry wolves with raging appetite, Scour through the fields, ne'er fear the stormy night-- Their whelps at home expect the promised food, And long to temper their dry chaps in blood--
<p/>So rush'd we forth at once. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dryden/-- Dryden</b></font>)</div>--Dryden's Virgil, ii. 479. 245 -- The destinies ordain. --<div class="bookquote">``In the mythology, also, of the Iliad, purely Pagan as it is
<p/>, we discover one important truth unconsciously involved, which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages.
<p/>No distinct empire is assigned to fate or fortune; the will of the father of gods and men is absolute and uncontrollable.
<p/>This seems to be the true character of the Homeric deity, and it is very necessary that the student of Greek literature should bear it constantly in mind.
<p/>A strong instance in the Iliad itself to illustrate this position, is the passage where Jupiter laments to Juno the approaching death of Sarpedon. '
<p/>says he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) `since it is fated -LRB-moira-RRB- that Sarpedon, dearest to me of men, should be slain by Patroclus, the son of Menoetius!
<p/>Indeed, my heart is divided within me while I ruminate it in my mind, whether having snatched him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) up from out of the lamentable battle, I should not at once place him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) alive in the fertile land of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own Lycia, or whether I should now destroy him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) by the hands of the son of Menoetius!'
<p/>Zeus or Jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent. Alas me!' To which Juno answers--`Dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man, long since destined by fate -LRB-palai pepromenon-RRB-?
<p/>Here it is clear from both speakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die, Jupiter might still, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleased, save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and place him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entirely out of the reach of any such event, and further, in the alternative, that Jupiter himself would destroy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the hands of another.''

<p/>257 Coleridge -LRB-Greek Classic Poets, p. 182, seq.-RRB- has diligently compared this with the description of the shield of Hercules by Hesiod.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) remarks that, ``with two or three exceptions, the imagery differs in little more than the names and arrangements; and the difference of arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether for the worse.
<p/>The natural consecution of the Homeric images needs no exposition: it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work.
<p/>The Hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or congruity: Mars and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs and Lapithae;-- but the gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with the Muses, waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence however, we are hurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images of war, over an arm of the sea, in which the sporting dolphins, the fugitive fishes, and the fisherman on the shore with his (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) casting net, are minutely represented.
<p/>As to the Hesiodic images themselves, the leading remark is, that they catch at beauty by ornament, and at sublimity by exaggeration; and upon the untenable supposition of the genuineness of this poem, there is this curious peculiarity
<p/>, that, in the description of scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is decisive--while in those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps, that the Hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage.

<p/>By a close study of life, and by a true and natural mode of expressing everything, Homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and difficult situations, and to extricate himself from them with the completest success.
<p/>The whole scene between Achilles and Priam, when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly skilful, and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the Iliad.
<p/>Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of Priam, the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if genius did not often, especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism, we might be induced, on this account alone, to consider the last book of the Iliad as what is called spurious, in other words, of later date than the rest of the poem.
<p/>Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying the mind of Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) father; in gradually introducing the parallel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) own situation; and, lastly, mentioning Hector's name when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hector</b></font>) perceives that the hero is softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of the conqueror.
<p/>The ego d'eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the Iliad.
<p/>'' Dryden. 295 In reference to the whole scene that follows, the remarks of Coleridge are well worth reading:-- '' They are almost too fine and pathetic.
<p/>The whole passage defies translation, for there is that about the Greek which has no name, but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in the original, and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another language.''--Coleridge, p. 195.
<p/>296 <div class="bookquote">``Achilles' ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The heroic age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws.
<p/>Retributive vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man; but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the body from which it had separated.
<p/>Hence a denial of the rites essential to the soul's admission into the more favoured regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores of the infernal river.
<p/>The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus to Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) own obsequies, shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge, which, even after death, was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades.
<p/>Hence before yielding up the body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for even this partial cession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) just rights of retribution.'' (<font color='red'><b>-- Mure/Mure</b></font>)</div>--Mure, vol.
<p/>i. 289. 297 Such was the fate of Astyanax, when Troy was taken. '' Here, from the tow'r by stern Ulysses thrown, Andromache bewail'd her (<font color='blue'><b>Astyanax</b></font>) infant son.
<p/>The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant and interesting view of Helen's character-- <div class="bookquote">``Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand that has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us also the consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is through the Iliad a genuine lady, graceful in motion and speech, noble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) associations, full of remorse for a fault for which higher powers seem responsible, yet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had committed her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>).
<p/>I have always thought the following speech in which Helen laments Hector, and hints at her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own invidious and unprotected situation in Troy, as almost the sweetest passage in the poem.
<p/>It is another striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the rest.'' (<font color='red'><b>Helen character</b></font>)</div>--Classic Poets, p. 198, seq.
<p/>'' Merrick's Tryphiodorus, v. 675. 298 299 '' And here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated to exalt and purify our impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) character.
<p/>We now leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) in repose and under the full influence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Achilles</b></font>) great qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a few short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.
<p/>The frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the Iliad, to the speedy termination of its hero's course, and the moral on the vanity of human life which they indicate, are among the finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework of the poem is united.''--Mure, vol.
<p/>Cowper says,--<div class="bookquote">``I cannot take my leave of this noble poem without expressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it.
<p/>It is like the exit of a great man out of company, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has entertained magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous, yet without much ceremony.
