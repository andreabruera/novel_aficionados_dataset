A. Wolf , turning to account the Venetian Scholia , which had then been recently published , first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the Homeric text . A considerable part of that dissertation -LRB- though by no means the whole -RRB- is employed in vindicating the position , previously announced by Bentley , amongst others , that the separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order , until the days of Peisistratus , in the sixth century before Christ . As a step towards that conclusion , Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times , to which their composition is referred ; and that without writing , neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet , nor , if realized by him , transmitted with assurance to posterity . The absence of easy and convenient writing , such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts , among the early Greeks , was thus one of the points in Wolf 's case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey . By Nitzsch , and other leading opponents of Wolf , the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it ; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey , to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning . To me it appears , that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to Peisistratus and his associates , in reference to the Homeric poems , are nowise admissible . But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question , if it could be shown , that , in order to controvert it , we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems , in the ninth century before the Christian aera . Few things , in my opinion , can be more improbable ; and Mr. Payne Knight , opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis , admits this no less than Wolf himself . We have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad , and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed ; nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus , Simonides of Amorgus , Kallinus , Tyrtaeus , Xanthus , and the other early elegiac and lyric poets , committed their compositions to writing , or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar . The first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer , is in the famous ordinance of Solon , with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenaea : but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed , we are unable to say . Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the beginning , rest their case , not upon positive proofs , nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetry -- for they admit generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read , but recited and heard , -- but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems -- the unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy . But here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater ; for the existence of trained bards , gifted with extraordinary memory , -LRB- 25 -RRB- is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts , in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing , and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious . Moreover , there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript ; for if such had been the fact , blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession , which we know that it was not , as well from the example of Demodokus , in the Odyssey , as from that of the blind bard of Chios , in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo , whom Thucydides , as well as the general tenor of Grecian legend , identifies with Homer himself . The author of that hymn , be he who he may , could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art , if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest . '' ","i":5024},{"w":"`` these poems , or indeed any other Greek poems , first began to be written , must be matter of conjecture , though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solon . If , in the absence of evidence , we may venture upon naming any more determinate period , the question a once suggests itself , What were the purposes which , in that state of society , a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer ? Not for the rhapsodes ; for with them it was not only planted in the memory , but also interwoven with the feelings , and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice , pauses , and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery , and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce . Not for the general public -- they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery , and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival . The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be suitable would be a select few ; studious and curious men ; a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd , and who would , on perusing the written words , realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter . Incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present , there is in all early societies , and there was in early Greece , a time when no such reading class existed . If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed , we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing . Now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece , is the middle of the seventh century before the Christian aera -LRB- B.C. 660 to B.C. 630 -RRB- , the age of Terpander , Kallinus , Archilochus , Simonides of Amorgus , & c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music -- the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter , and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life . Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication -LRB- to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable , yet It argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect ; and the men who stood forward in it , may well be considered as desirous to study , and competent to criticize , from their own individual point of view , the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies , just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer . There seems , therefore , ground for conjecturing that -LRB- for the use of this newly-formed and important , but very narrow class -RRB- , manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old epics , -- the Thebais and the Cypria , as well as the Iliad and the Odyssey , -- began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century -LRB- B.C. 1 -RRB- ; and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce , which took place about the same period , would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon . A reading class , when once formed , would doubtless slowly increase , and the number of manuscripts along with it ; so that before the time of Solon , fifty years afterwards , both readers and manuscripts , though still comparatively few , might have attained a certain recognized authority , and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes .

Although the example of Homer has since rendered some such formal enumeration of the forces engaged , a common practice in epic poems descriptive of great warlike adventures , still so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as imperatively required , nor perhaps such as would , in ordinary cases , suggest itself to the mind of a poet . Yet there is scarcely any portion of the Iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period , with the remainder of the work . The composition of the Catalogue , whensoever it may have taken place , necessarily presumes its author 's acquaintance with a previously existing Iliad . It were impossible otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of proper names , most of them historically unimportant , and not a few altogether fictitious : or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred lines , and incidentally scattered over the thousands which follow : equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text , several of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety , but through the medium of the Iliad .

No interposition takes place but on the part of the specially authorised agents of Jove , or on that of one or two contumacious deities , described as boldly setting his commands at defiance , but checked and reprimanded for their disobedience ; while the other divine warriors , who in the previous and subsequent cantos are so active in support of their favourite heroes , repeatedly allude to the supreme edict as the cause of their present inactivity . '' ","i":226117},{"w":"`` Perhaps the boldest excursion of Homer into this region of poetical fancy is the collision into which , in the twenty-first of the Iliad , he has brought the river god Scamander , first with Achilles , and afterwards with Vulcan , when summoned by Juno to the hero 's aid .

Their wide , shingly beds are in summer comparatively dry , so as to be easily forded by the foot passenger .

Hence a denial of the rites essential to the soul 's admission into the more favoured regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores of the infernal river . The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus to Achilles , of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies , shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge , which , even after death , was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades .
