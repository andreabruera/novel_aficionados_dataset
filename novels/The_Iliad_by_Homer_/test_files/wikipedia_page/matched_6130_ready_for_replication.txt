trojan warachilles tending the wounded patroclus attic red figure kylix bc outcome greek victory destruction of $troy$ see also historicity of the iliad see also
in classical attic sometimes referred to as the song of ilion or song of ilium is an ancient greek epic poem in dactylic hexameter traditionally attributed to $homer$
set during the trojan war the ten year siege of the city of $troy$ ilium by coalition of greek states it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of quarrel between king agamemnon and the warrior $achilles$
although the story covers only few weeks in the final year of the war the iliad mentions or alludes to many of the greek legends about the siege the earlier events such as the gathering of warriors for the siege the cause of the war and related concerns tend to appear near the beginning
then the epic #narrative# takes up events prophesied for the future such as $achilles$ imminent death and the fall of $troy$ although the #narrative# #end# before these events take place
however as these events are prefigured and alluded to more and more vividly when it reaches an #end# the poem has told more or less complete tale of the trojan war
trojan war in popular culture aeneas and the founding of rome the iliad ˈɪliəd the iliad is paired with #something# of sequel the odyssey also attributed to $homer$
along with the odyssey the iliad is among the oldest extant works of western literature and its written version is usually dated to around the #century# bc
in the modern vulgate the standard accepted version the iliad contains lines it is written in homeric greek literary amalgam of ionic greek and other dialects
according to michael nagler the iliad is more complicated epic poem than the odyssey influence on the arts and literature
after an invocation to the muses the story launches in medias res towards the #end# of the trojan war between the $trojans$ and the besieging greeks
chryses trojan priest of apollo offers the greeks wealth for the return of his daughter chryseis held captive of agamemnon the greek leader
the first verses of the iliad #note# book numbers are in parentheses and come before the synopsis of the book although most of the greek army is in favour of the offer agamemnon refuses
chryses prays for apollo help and apollo causes plague to afflict the greek army after nine days of plague $achilles$ the leader of the myrmidon contingent calls an #assembly# to deal with the problem
under pressure agamemnon agrees to return chryseis to her father but decides to take $achilles$ captive briseis as compensation $achilles$ furiously declares that he and his men will no longer fight for agamemnon and will go home
odysseus takes ship and returns chryseis to her father whereupon apollo #end# the plague in the meantime agamemnon messengers take briseis away
$achilles$ asks his mother to ask zeus to bring the greeks to the breaking point by the $trojans$ so agamemnon will realize how much the greeks need $achilles$
$achilles$ becomes very upset sits by the seashore and prays to his mother thetis thetis does so and zeus agrees zeus sends dream to agamemnon urging him to attack $troy$
agamemnon heeds the dream but first decides to test the greek army morale by telling them to go home the plan backfires and only the intervention of odysseus inspired by athena stops rout
odysseus confronts and beats thersites common soldier who voices discontent about fighting agamemnon war after meal the greeks deploy in companies upon the trojan plain
the poet takes the opportunity to describe the provenance of each greek contingent when news of the greek deployment reaches king $priam$ the $trojans$ respond in sortie upon the plain
the armies approach each other but before they meet paris offers to #end# the war by fighting duel with $great_menelaus$ urged by his brother and head of the trojan army $stern_hector$
while $argive_helen$ tells $priam$ about the greek commanders from the walls of $troy$ both sides swear truce and promise to abide by the outcome of the duel
in list similar to that for the greeks the poet describes the $trojans$ and their allies paris is beaten but aphrodite rescues him and leads him to bed with $argive_helen$ before $great_menelaus$ can kill him
pressured by hera hatred of $troy$ zeus arranges for the trojan pandaros to break the truce by wounding $great_menelaus$ with an arrow
in the fighting diomedes kills many $trojans$ including pandaros and defeats aeneas whom aphrodite rescues but diomedes attacks and wounds the goddess
agamemnon rouses the greeks and battle is joined apollo faces diomedes and warns him against warring with gods many heroes and commanders join in including $stern_hector$ and the gods supporting each side try to influence the battle
$stern_hector$ rallies the $trojans$ and prevents rout the greek diomedes and the trojan glaukos find common ground and exchange unequal gifts
$stern_hector$ enters the city urges prayers and #sacrifice# incites paris to battle bids his #wife# andromache and #son# astyanax farewell on the city walls and rejoins the battle
emboldened by athena diomedes wounds ares and puts him out of action $stern_hector$ duels with $oilean_ajax$ but nightfall interrupts the fight and both sides retire
the greeks agree to burn their dead and build wall to protect their ships and camp while the $trojans$ quarrel about returning $argive_helen$
paris offers to return the treasure he took and give further wealth as compensation but not $argive_helen$ and the offer is refused
a day truce is agreed for burning the dead during which the greeks also build their wall and trench the next #morning# zeus prohibits the gods from interfering and fighting begins anew
the $trojans$ prevail and force the greeks back to their wall while hera and athena are forbidden to help night falls before the $trojans$ can assail the greek wall
they camp in the field to attack at first light and their watchfires light the plain like stars iliad book viii lines greek manuscript late early #century# ad
agamemnon admits his error and sends an embassy composed of odysseus $oilean_ajax$ phoenix and two heralds to offer briseis and extensive gifts to $achilles$ who has been camped next to his ships throughout if only he will return to the fighting
$achilles$ and his companion patroclus receive the embassy well but $achilles$ angrily refuses agamemnon offer and declares that he would only return to battle if the $trojans$ reached his ships and threatened them with fire
later that night odysseus and diomedes venture out to the trojan lines kill the trojan dolon and wreak havoc in the camps of some thracian allies of $troy$
$achilles$ sends patroclus from his camp to inquire about the greek casualties and while there patroclus is moved to pity by speech of $wise_nestor$
in the #morning# the fighting is fierce and agamemnon diomedes and odysseus are all wounded the $trojans$ attack the greek wall on foot
$stern_hector$ ignoring an omen leads the terrible fighting the greeks are overwhelmed and routed the wall gate is broken and $stern_hector$ #charge# in
hera seduces zeus and lures him to sleep allowing poseidon to help the greeks and the $trojans$ are driven back onto the plain
the trojan seer polydamas urges $stern_hector$ to fall back and warns him about $achilles$ but is ignored zeus awakes and is enraged by poseidon intervention
against the mounting discontent of the greek supporting gods zeus sends apollo to aid the $trojans$ who once again breach the wall and the battle reaches the ships
$achilles$ relents and lends patroclus his armor but sends him off with $stern_hector$ admonition not to pursue the $trojans$ lest he take $achilles$ glory
patroclus cannot stand to watch any longer and begs $achilles$ to be allowed to defend the ships patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle and arrives as the $trojans$ set fire to the first ships
the $trojans$ are routed by the sudden onslaught and patroclus begins his assault by killing zeus #son# $sarpedon$ leading ally of the $trojans$
patroclus ignoring $achilles$ command pursues and reaches the gates of $troy$ where apollo himself stops him patroclus is set upon by apollo and euphorbos and is finally killed by $stern_hector$
$achilles$ is mad with grief when he hears of patroclus death and vows to take vengeance on $stern_hector$ his mother thetis grieves too knowing that $achilles$ is fated to die young if he kills $stern_hector$
$stern_hector$ takes $achilles$ armor from the fallen patroclus but fighting develops around patroclus body $achilles$ is urged to help retrieve patroclus body but has no armour
bathed in brilliant radiance by athena $achilles$ stands next to the greek wall and roars in rage the $trojans$ are dismayed by his appearance and the greeks manage to bear patroclus body away
polydamas urges $stern_hector$ again to withdraw into the city again $stern_hector$ refuses and the $trojans$ camp on the plain at nightfall
meanwhile at thetis request hephaestus fashions new set of armor for $achilles$ including magnificently wrought shield in the #morning# agamemnon gives $achilles$ all the promised gifts including briseis but $achilles$ is indifferent to them
$achilles$ fasts while the greeks take their meal straps on his new armor and takes up his great spear his horse xanthos prophesies to $achilles$ his death
$achilles$ drives his chariot into battle zeus lifts the ban on the gods interference and the gods freely help both sides
driving the $trojans$ before him $achilles$ cuts off half their number in the river skamandros and proceeds to slaughter them filling the river with the dead
$achilles$ burning with rage and grief slays many the river angry at the killing confronts $achilles$ but is beaten back by hephaestus firestorm
the great gates of the city are opened to receive the fleeing $trojans$ and apollo leads $achilles$ away from the city by pretending to be trojan
when apollo reveals himself to $achilles$ the $trojans$ have retreated into the city all except for $stern_hector$ who having twice ignored the counsels of polydamas feels the shame of the rout and resolves to face $achilles$ despite the pleas of his parents $priam$ and hecuba
when $achilles$ approaches $stern_hector$ will fails him and he is chased around the city by $achilles$ finally athena tricks him into stopping and he turns to face his opponent
after brief duel $achilles$ stabs $stern_hector$ through the neck before dying $stern_hector$ reminds $achilles$ that he too is fated to die in the war
the ghost of patroclus comes to $achilles$ in dream urging him to carry out his burial rites and to arrange for their bones to be entombed together
$achilles$ takes $stern_hector$ body and dishonours it by dragging it behind his chariot the greeks hold day of funeral games and $achilles$ gives out the prizes
dismayed by $achilles$ continued abuse of $stern_hector$ body zeus decides that it must be returned to $priam$ led by $hermes$ $priam$ takes wagon out of $troy$ across the plains and into the greek camp unnoticed
he clasps $achilles$ by the knees and begs for his #son# body $achilles$ is moved to tears and the two lament their losses in the war

in the literary trojan war of the iliad the olympian gods goddesses and minor deities fight among themselves and participate in human warfare often by interfering with humans to counter other gods
unlike their portrayals in greek religion $homer$ portrayal of gods suited his #narrative# purpose the gods in traditional #thought# of fourth #century# athenians were not spoken of in terms familiar to us from $homer$
the classical era historian herodotus says that $homer$ and hesiod his contemporary were the first writers to name and describe the gods appearance and character
in greek gods human lives what we can learn from myths mary lefkowitz discusses the relevance of divine action in the iliad attempting to answer the question of whether or not divine intervention is discrete occurrence for its own sake or if such godly behaviors are mere human character metaphors
the intellectual interest of classic era authors such as thucydides and plato was limited to their utility as a way of talking about human life rather than description or truth because if the gods remain religious figures rather than human metaphors their existence without the foundation of either dogma or bible of faiths
the religion had no founder and was not the creation of an inspired teacher which were popular origins of existing religions in the world
the individuals were free to believe what they wanted as the greek religion was created out of consensus of the people
then allowed greek culture the intellectual breadth and freedom to conjure gods fitting any religious function they required as people these beliefs coincide to the #thought# about the gods in polytheistic greek religion
in the article greek religion a h adkins agrees with this by saying the early greeks personalized every aspect of their world natural and cultural and their experiences in it
the earth the #sea# the #mountain# the rivers custom law themis and one share in society and its goods were all seen in personal as well as naturalistic terms
as result of this thinking each god or goddess in polytheistic greek religion is attributed to an aspect of the human world
for example poseidon is the god of the #sea# aphrodite is the goddess of beauty ares is the god of war and so on and so forth for many other gods
this is how greek culture was defined as many athenians felt the presence of their gods through divine intervention in significant events in their lives
in the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind psychologist julian jaynes uses the iliad as major piece of evidence for his theory of bicameralism which posits that until about the time described in the iliad humans had far different mentality from present day humans
oftentimes they found these events to be mysterious and inexplicable he says that humans during that time were lacking what we today call consciousness
he suggests that humans heard and obeyed commands from what they identified as gods until the change in human mentality that incorporated the motivating force into the conscious self
he points out that almost every action in the iliad is directed caused or influenced by god and that earlier translations show an astonishing lack of #word# suggesting #thought# planning or introspection
some scholars believe that the gods may have intervened in the mortal world because of quarrels they may have had among each other
$homer$ interprets the world at this time by using the passion and emotion of the gods to be determining factors of what happens on the human level
those that do appear he argues are misinterpretations made by translators imposing modern mentality on the characters an example of one of these relationships in the iliad occurs between athena hera and aphrodite
athena and hera are envious of aphrodite because of beauty pageant on mount $olympus$ in which paris chose aphrodite to be the most beautiful goddess over both hera and athena
in the final book of the poem $homer$ writes he offended athena and hera both goddesses wolfgang kullmann further goes on to say
hera and athena disappointment over the victory of aphrodite in the judgement of paris determines the #whole# conduct of both goddesses in the iliad and is the cause of their hatred for paris the judge and his town $troy$
hera and athena then continue to support the achaean forces throughout the poem because paris is part of the $trojans$ while aphrodite aids paris and the $trojans$
the emotions between the goddesses often translate to actions they take in the mortal world for example in book of the iliad paris challenges any of the achaeans to single combat and $great_menelaus$ steps forward
now he have hauled him off and won undying glory but aphrodite zeus daughter was quick to the mark snapped the rawhide strap
aphrodite intervened out of her own self interest to save paris from the wrath of $great_menelaus$ because paris had helped her to win the beauty pageant
the partisanship of aphrodite towards paris induces constant intervention by all of the gods especially to give motivational speeches to their respective proteges while often appearing in the shape of human #being# they are familiar with
$great_menelaus$ was dominating the battle and was on the verge of killing paris this connection of emotions to actions is just one example out of many that occur throughout the poem
#fate# κήρ kēr fated death propels most of the events of the iliad once set gods and men abide it neither truly able nor willing to contest it
how #fate# is set is unknown but it is told by the #fate# and by zeus through sending omens to seers such as calchas
men and their gods continually speak of heroic acceptance and cowardly avoidance of one slated #fate# no deadly destiny with the #son# of leto has killed me and of men it was euphorbos
you yourself are not one who shall live long but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you to go down under the hands of aiakos great #son# achilleus
you are only my third slayer and put away in your heart this other thing that tell you here patroclus alludes to fated death by $stern_hector$ hand and $stern_hector$ fated death by $achilles$ hand
each accepts the outcome of his life yet no one knows if the gods can alter #fate# the first instance of this doubt occurs in book xvi
seeing patroclus about to kill $sarpedon$ his mortal #son# zeus says ah me that it is destined that the dearest of men $sarpedon$ must go down under the hands of menoitios #son# patroclus
do you wish to bring back man who is mortal one long since doomed by his destiny from ill sounding death and release him
about his dilemma hera asks zeus majesty #son# of kronos what sort of thing have you spoken do it then but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you
in deciding between losing #son# or abiding #fate# zeus king of the gods allows it this motif recurs when he considers sparing $stern_hector$ whom he loves and #respect#
do you wish to bring back man who is mortal one long since doomed by his destiny from ill sounding death and release him
this time it is athene who challenges him father of the shining bolt dark misted what is this you said do it then but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you
again zeus appears capable of altering #fate# but does not deciding instead to abide set outcomes similarly #fate# spares aeneas after apollo convinces the over matched trojan to fight $achilles$
but come let us ourselves get him away from death for fear the #son# of kronos may be angered if now achilleus it is destined that he shall be the survivor that the generation of dardanos shall not die
whether or not the gods can alter #fate# they do abide it despite its countering their human allegiances thus the mysterious origin of #fate# is power beyond the gods
#fate# implies the primeval tripartite division of the world that zeus poseidon and hades effected in deposing their father cronus for its dominion
divinely aided aeneas escapes the wrath of $achilles$ and survives the trojan war zeus took the air and the sky poseidon the waters and hades the underworld the land of the dead
yet they share dominion of the earth despite the earthly powers of the olympic gods only the three #fate# set the destiny of man
kleos κλέος glory fame is the concept of glory earned in heroic battle yet $achilles$ must choose only one of the two rewards either nostos or kleos
in book ix ix he poignantly tells agamemnon envoys odysseus phoenix $oilean_ajax$ begging his reinstatement to battle about having to choose between two #fate# διχθαδίας κήρας
μήτηρ γάρ τέ μέ φησι θεὰ θέτις ἀργυρόπεζα διχθαδίας κῆρας φερέμεν θανάτοιο τέλος δέ εἰ μέν αὖθι μένων τρώων πόλιν ἀμφιμάχωμαι ὤλετο μέν μοι νόστος ἀτὰρ κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται εἰ
κεν οἴκαδ ἵκωμι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν ὤλετό μοι κλέος ἐσθλόν ἐπὶ δηρὸν δέ μοι αἰὼν ἔσσεται οὐδέ κέ ὦκα τέλος θανάτοιο κιχείη
δέ for my mother thetis the goddess of silver feet tells me i carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death
if stay here and fight beside the city of the $trojans$ my return home is gone but my glory shall be everlasting but if return home to the beloved land of my fathers the excellence of my glory is gone but there will be long life left for me and my #end# in death will not come to me quickly
in forgoing his nostos he will earn the greater reward of kleos aphthiton κλέος ἄφθιτον fame imperishable each occurrence denotes an object
translator lattimore renders kleos aphthiton as forever immortal and as forever imperishable connoting $achilles$ mortality by underscoring his greater reward in returning to battle $troy$
agamemnon sceptre the wheel of hebe chariot the house of poseidon the throne of zeus the house of hephaestus kleos is often given visible representation by the prizes won in battle
$achilles$ shield crafted by hephaestus and given to him by his mother thetis bears an image of stars in the centre
the stars conjure profound images of the place of single man no matter how heroic in the perspective of the entire cosmos
when agamemnon takes briseis from $achilles$ he takes away #portion# of the kleos he had earned nostos νόστος homecoming occurs seven times in the poem making it minor theme in the iliad itself
yet the concept of homecoming is much explored in other ancient greek literature especially in the post war homeward #fortune# experienced by the atreidae agamemnon and $great_menelaus$ and odysseus see the odyssey
pride drives the plot of the iliad the greeks gather on the plain of $troy$ to wrest $argive_helen$ from the $trojans$
though the majority of the $trojans$ would gladly return $argive_helen$ to the greeks they defer to the pride of their prince alexandros also known as paris
at the start of the iliad agamemnon pride sets forth chain of events that leads him to take from $achilles$ briseis the girl that he had originally given $achilles$ in return for his martial prowess
due to this slight $achilles$ refuses to fight and asks his mother thetis to make sure that zeus causes the greeks to suffer on the battlefield until agamemnon comes to realize the harm he has done to $achilles$
within this frame $homer$ work begins $achilles$ pride allows him to beg thetis for the deaths of his greek friends and countrymen
when in book his friends urge him to return offering him loot and his girl briseis he refuses stuck in his vengeful pride
$achilles$ remains stuck until the very #end# when his anger at himself for patroclus death overcomes his pride at agamemnon slight
and he returns to kill $stern_hector$ he overcomes his pride again when he keeps his anger in check and returns $stern_hector$ to $priam$ at epic close
from epic start to epic finish pride drives the plot akin to kleos is timê τιμή #respect# honor the concept denoting the respectability an honorable man accrues with accomplishment cultural political martial per his station in life
in book i the greek troubles begin with king agamemnon dishonorable unkingly behavior first by threatening the priest chryses then by aggravating them in disrespecting $achilles$ by confiscating briseis from him
the warrior consequent rancor against the dishonorable king ruins the greek military cause hybris ὕβρις plays part similar to timê the epic takes as its thesis the anger of $achilles$ and the destruction it brings
uncontrolled anger destroys orderly social relationships and upsets the balance of correct actions necessary to keep the gods away from human #being#
despite the epic focus on $achilles$ rage hybris plays prominent role also serving as both kindling and fuel for many destructive events
anger disturbs the distance between human #being# and the gods agamemnon refuses to ransom chriseis up out of hybris and harms $achilles$ pride when he #demand# briseis
agamemnon spurs the greeks to fight by calling into question odysseus diomedes and $wise_nestor$ pride asking why they were cowering and waiting for help when they should be the ones leading the #charge#
while the events of the iliad focus on the $achilles$ rage and the destruction it brings on hybris fuels and stokes them both
the poem initial #word# μῆνιν mēnin accusative of μῆνις mēnis wrath rage fury establishes the iliad principal theme the wrath of $achilles$
his personal rage and wounded soldier vanity propel the story the greeks faltering in battle the slayings of patroclus and $stern_hector$ and the fall of $troy$
in book i the wrath of $achilles$ first emerges in the $achilles$ convoked meeting between the greek kings and the seer calchas
king agamemnon dishonours chryses the trojan priest of apollo by refusing with threat the restitution of his daughter chryseis despite the proffered ransom of gifts beyond count
hybris forces paris to fight against $great_menelaus$ the wrath of $achilles$ by michel drolling the insulted priest prays his god help and nine day rain of divine plague arrows falls upon the greeks
moreover in that meeting $achilles$ accuses agamemnon of #being# greediest for gain of all men but here is my threat to you
i shall convey her back in my own ship with my own followers but shall take the fair cheeked briseis your prize myself going to your shelter that you may learn well how much greater am than you and another man may shrink back from likening himself to me and contending against me
even as phoibos apollo is taking away my chryseis after that only athena stays $achilles$ wrath he vows to never again obey orders from agamemnon
furious $achilles$ cries to his mother thetis who persuades zeus divine intervention favouring the $trojans$ until $achilles$ rights are restored meanwhile $stern_hector$ leads the $trojans$ to almost pushing the greeks back to the #sea# book xii
later agamemnon contemplates defeat and retreat to greece book xiv again the wrath of $achilles$ turns the war tide in seeking vengeance when $stern_hector$ kills patroclus
aggrieved $achilles$ tears his hair and dirties his face thetis comforts her mourning #son# who tells her so it was here that the lord of men agamemnon angered me
still we will let all this be thing of the past and for all our sorrow beat down by force the anger deeply within us
now shall go to overtake that killer of dear life hektor then will accept my own death at whatever time zeus wishes to bring it about and the other immortals
accepting the prospect of death as fair price for avenging patroclus he returns to battle dooming $stern_hector$ and $troy$ thrice chasing him round the trojan walls before slaying him then dragging the corpse behind his chariot back to camp
$achilles$ slays $stern_hector$ by peter paul rubens further information homeric question and historicity of the iliad the poem dates to the archaic period of classical antiquity
herodotus having consulted the oracle at dodona placed $homer$ and hesiod at approximately years before his own time which would place them at bc
scholarly consensus mostly places it in the #century# bc although some favour #century# date the historical backdrop of the poem is the time of the late bronze age collapse in the early #century# bc
$homer$ is thus separated from his subject matter by about years the period known as the greek dark ages intense scholarly debate has surrounded the question of which #portion# of the poem preserve genuine #tradition# from the mycenaean period
the catalogue of ships in particular has the striking feature that its geography does not portray greece in the iron age the time of $homer$ but as it was before the dorian invasion
ἰλιάς of $troy$ is the specifically feminine adjective form from ἴλιον $troy$ the masculine adjective form would be ἰλιακός or ἴλιος
the title ἰλιάς ilias genitive ἰλιάδος iliados is elliptic for ποίησις ἰλιάς he poíesis iliás meaning the trojan poem venetus a copied in the #century# ad is the oldest fully extant manuscript of the iliad
the first edition of the iliad editio princeps edited by demetrius chalcondyles and published by bernardus nerlius and demetrius damilas in florence in
literature was central to the educational cultural function of the itinerant rhapsode who composed consistent epic poems from memory and improvisation and disseminated them via song and chant in his travels and at the panathenaic festival of athletics music poetics and #sacrifice# celebrating athena birthday
in antiquity the greeks applied the iliad and the odyssey as the bases of pedagogy originally classical scholars treated the iliad and the odyssey as written poetry and $homer$ as writer
his investigation of the oral homeric #style# stock epithets and reiteration #word# phrases stanzas established that these formulae were artifacts of oral #tradition# easily applied to hexametric line
a two #word# stock epithet g resourceful odysseus reiteration may complement character name by filling half line thus freeing the poet to compose half line of original formulaic text to complete his meaning
in yugoslavia parry and his assistant albert lord studied the oral formulaic composition of serbian oral poetry yielding the parry lord thesis that established oral #tradition# studies later developed by eric havelock marshall mcluhan walter ong and gregory nagy
in the singer of tales lord presents likenesses between the tragedies of the greek patroclus in the iliad and of the sumerian enkidu in the epic of gilgamesh and claims to refute with careful analysis of the repetition of thematic patterns that the patroclus storyline upsets $homer$ established compositional formulae of wrath bride stealing and rescue thus stock phrase reiteration does not restrict his originality in fitting story to rhyme creates an atmosphere of smoothness wherein $homer$ distinguishes patroclus from $achilles$ and foreshadows the former death with positive and negative turns of phrase
in the iliad occasional syntactic inconsistency may be an oral #tradition# effect for example aphrodite is laughter loving despite #being# painfully wounded by diomedes book and the divine representations may mix mycenaean and greek dark age bc mythologies parallelling the hereditary basileis nobles lower social rank rulers with minor deities such as scamander et al
yet by the milman parry had launched movement claiming otherwise despite mycenae and $troy$ #being# maritime powers the iliad features no #sea# battles
so the trojan shipwright of the ship that transported $argive_helen$ to $troy$ phereclus fights afoot as an infantryman the battle dress and armour of hero and soldier are well described
they enter battle in chariots launching javelins into the enemy formations then dismount for hand to hand combat with yet more javelin throwing rock throwing and if necessary hand to hand sword and shoulder borne hoplon shield fighting
$oilean_ajax$ the greater #son# of $ajax_telamon$ sports large rectangular shield σάκος sakos with which he protects himself and $teucer$ his brother
as $oilean_ajax$ cautiously pulled his shield aside $teucer$ would peer out quickly shoot off an arrow hit someone in the crowd dropping that soldier right where he stood ending his life
ninth came $teucer$ stretching his curved bow he stood beneath the shield of $oilean_ajax$ #son# of $ajax_telamon$ then he duck back crouching down by $oilean_ajax$ like child beside its mother
$oilean_ajax$ cumbersome shield is more suitable for defence than for offence while his cousin $achilles$ sports large rounded octagonal shield that he successfully deploys along with his spear against the $trojans$ just as man constructs wall for some high house using well fitted stones to keep out forceful winds that how close their helmets and bossed shields lined up shield pressing against shield helmet against helmet on the bright ridges of the helmets horsehair plumes touched when warriors moved their heads
in describing infantry combat $homer$ names the phalanx formation but most scholars do not believe the historical trojan war was so fought
in the bronze age the chariot was the main battle transport weapon g the available evidence from the dendra armour and the pylos palace paintings indicate the mycenaeans used two man chariots with long spear armed principal rider unlike the three man hittite chariots with short spear armed riders and unlike the arrow armed egyptian and assyrian two man chariots
$wise_nestor$ spearheads his troops with chariots he advises them in your eagerness to engage the $trojans$ dont any of you #charge# ahead of others trusting in your #strength# and horsemanship
$oilean_ajax$ would then conceal him with his shining shield that how close they were to one another any man whose chariot confronts an enemy should thrust with his spear at him from there
that the most effective tactic the way men wiped out city strongholds long ago their chests full of that #style# and spirit
although $homer$ depictions are graphic it can be seen in the very #end# that victory in war is far more somber occasion where all that is lost becomes apparent
this overall depiction of war runs contrary to many other ancient greek depictions where war is an aspiration for greater glory
while the homeric poems the iliad in particular were not necessarily revered scripture of the ancient greeks they were most certainly seen as guides that were important to the intellectual understanding of any educated greek citizen
this is evidenced by the #fact# that in the late fifth #century# bc it was the sign of man of standing to be able to recite the iliad and odyssey by heart
moreover it can be argued that the warfare shown in the iliad and the way in which it was depicted had profound and very traceable effect on greek warfare in general
in particular the effect of epic literature can be broken down into three categories tactics ideology and the mindset of commanders
on the other hand the funeral games are lively for the dead man life is celebrated in order to discern these effects it is necessary to take look at few examples from each of these categories
much of the detailed fighting in the iliad is done by the heroes in an orderly one on one fashion much like the odyssey there is even set ritual which must be observed in each of these conflicts
for example major hero may encounter lesser hero from the opposing side in which case the minor hero is introduced threats may be exchanged and then the minor hero is slain
here is an example of this ritual and this type of one on one combat in the iliad there telamonian $oilean_ajax$ struck down the #son# of anthemion simoeisios in his stripling beauty whom once his mother descending from $ida$ bore beside the banks of simoeis when she had followed her father and mother to tend the
therefore they called him simoeisios but he could not render again the care of his dear parents he was short lived beaten down beneath the spear of high hearted $oilean_ajax$ who struck him as he first came forward beside the nipple of the right breast and the bronze spearhead drove clean
the biggest issue in reconciling the connection between the epic fighting of the iliad and later greek warfare is the phalanx or hoplite warfare seen in greek #history# well after $homer$ iliad
while there are discussions of soldiers arrayed in semblances of the phalanx throughout the iliad the focus of the poem on the heroic fighting as mentioned above would seem to contradict the tactics of the phalanx
the masculine one on one fighting of epic is manifested in phalanx fighting on the emphasis of holding one position in formation
the victor often strips the body of its armor and military accoutrements however the phalanx did have its heroic aspects this replaces the singular heroic competition found in the iliad
one example of this is the spartan tale of picked men fighting against picked argives in this battle of champions only two men are left standing for the argives and one for the spartans
othryades the remaining spartan goes back to stand in his formation with mortal wounds while the remaining two argives go back to $argos$ to report their victory
thus the spartans claimed this as victory as their last man displayed the ultimate feat of bravery by maintaining his position in the phalanx
the iliad expresses definite disdain for tactical trickery when $stern_hector$ says before he challenges the great $oilean_ajax$ i know how to storm my way into the struggle of flying horses know how to tread the measures on the grim floor of the war god
yet great as you are would not strike you by stealth watching for my chance but openly so if perhaps might hit you
however despite examples of disdain for this tactical trickery there is reason to believe that the iliad as well as later greek warfare endorsed tactical genius on the part of their commanders
for example there are multiple passages in the iliad with commanders such as agamemnon or $wise_nestor$ discussing the arraying of troops so as to gain an advantage
in terms of the ideology of commanders in later greek #history# the iliad has an interesting effect indeed the trojan war is won by notorious example of greek guile in the trojan horse
the connection in this case between guileful tactics of the greeks in the iliad and those of the later greeks is not difficult one to find
spartan commanders often seen as the pinnacle of greek military prowess were known for their tactical trickery and for them this was feat to be desired in commander
this is even later referred to by $homer$ in the odyssey indeed this type of leadership was the standard advice of greek tactical writers
ultimately while homeric or epic fighting is certainly not completely replicated in later greek warfare many of its ideals tactics and instruction are
hans van wees argues that the period that the descriptions of warfare relate can be pinned down fairly specifically to the first half of the #century# bc
the iliad was standard work of great importance already in classical greece and remained so throughout the hellenistic and byzantine periods
influence on the arts and literature main article trojan war in popular culture subjects from the trojan war were favourite among ancient greek dramatists
aeschylus trilogy the oresteia comprising agamemnon the libation bearers and the eumenides follows the story of agamemnon after his return from the war
$homer$ also came to be of great influence in european culture with the resurgence of interest in greek antiquity during the renaissance and it remains the first and most influential work of the western canon
in its full form the text made its return to italy and western europe beginning in the #century# primarily through translations into latin and the vernacular languages
prior to this reintroduction however shortened latin version of the poem known as the ilias latina was very widely studied and read as basic school text
the west tended to view $homer$ as unreliable as they believed they possessed much more down to earth and realistic eyewitness accounts of the trojan war written by dares and dictys cretensis who were supposedly present at the events
these late antique forged accounts formed the basis of several eminently popular medieval chivalric romances most notably those of benoît de sainte maure and guido delle colonne
these in turn spawned many others in various european languages such as the first printed english book the recuyell of the historyes of troye
other accounts read in the middle ages were antique latin retellings such as the excidium troiae and works in the vernaculars such as the icelandic $troy$ saga
even without $homer$ the trojan war story had remained central to western european medieval literary culture and its sense of identity
most nations and several royal houses traced their origins to heroes at the trojan war britain was supposedly settled by the trojan brutus for instance
william shakespeare used the plot of the iliad as source material for his play troilus and cressida but focused on medieval legend the love story of troilus #son# of king $priam$ of $troy$ and cressida daughter of the trojan soothsayer calchas
the play often considered to be comedy reverses traditional views on events of the trojan war and depicts $achilles$ as coward $oilean_ajax$ as dull unthinking mercenary etc
william theed the elder made an impressive bronze statue of thetis as she brought $achilles$ his new armor forged by hephaesthus
