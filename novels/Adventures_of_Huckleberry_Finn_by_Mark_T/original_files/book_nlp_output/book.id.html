<p/>'' Out of Bondage Tom's Liberality Yours Truly EXPLANATORY IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: THE AUTHOR.
<p/>CHAPTER I. YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.
<p/>HUCKLEBERRY FINN Scene: The Mississippi Valley Time: Forty to fifty years ago That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Twain</b></font>) told the truth, mainly.
<p/>I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.
<p/>Tom's Aunt Polly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.
<p/>There was things which he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) stretched, but mainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) told the truth. That is nothing. Aunt Polly-- Now the way that the book winds up is this
<p/>: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece--all gold.
<p/>Well, Judge Thatcher he (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>) took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round--more than a body could tell what to do with.
<p/>The Widow Douglas she (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) took me for her (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) son, and allowed she (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out.
<p/>It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied.
<p/>But Tom Sawyer he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) hunted me up and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable.
<p/>The widow she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) called me a lot of other names, too, but she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) never meant no harm by it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.
<p/>So I went back. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time.
<p/>When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.
<p/>In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.
<p/>After supper she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) got out her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>); but by and by she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>), because I don't take no stock in dead people.
<p/>Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) wouldn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must try to not do it any more.
<p/>That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.
<p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), and took a set at me now with a spelling-book.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) done it herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) ease up.
<p/>Miss Watson would say, <div class="bookquote">``Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Watson</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Don't scrunch up like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Watson</b></font>)</div>and pretty soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to behave?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change,
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said it was wicked to say what I said; said she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) wouldn't say it for the whole world; she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) was going to live so as to go to the good place.
<p/>I warn't particular. Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) was going, so I made up my mind
<p/>I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) had got a start, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) went on and told me all about the good place. So I didn't think much of it.
<p/>But I never said so. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said not by a considerable sight.
<p/>I was glad about that, because I wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) and me to be together. Miss Watson she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
<p/>By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table.
<p/>Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.
<p/>The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was,
<p/>I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods
<p/>I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving.
<p/>Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up.
<p/>I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me.
<p/>I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.
<p/>You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider.
<p/>I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know.
<p/>Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than ever.
<p/>I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. But I hadn't no confidence. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees--something was a stirring.
<p/>I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a <div class="bookquote">``me-yow! me-yow! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>down there. That was good! Says I, <div class="bookquote">``me-yow!
<p/>me-yow!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.
<p/>Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.
<p/>WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads.
<p/>CHAPTER II. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still.
<p/>Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) pretty clear, because there was a light behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got up and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) neck out about a minute, listening. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Who dah?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) listened some more; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) come tiptoeing down and stood right between us
<p/>; we could a touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close together.
<p/>There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders.
<p/>If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places.
<p/>Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. Pretty soon Jim says: <div class="bookquote">``Say, who is you?
<p/>Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf`n. Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: I's gwyne to set down here and listen
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) back up against a tree, and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) legs out till one of them most touched one of mine.
<p/>tell I hears it agin. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. My nose begun to itch.
<p/>It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside.
<p/>Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that.
<p/>I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.
<p/>Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth--and we went creeping away on our hands and knees.
<p/>Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon comfortable again. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.
<p/>But I said no; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I warn't in. Then Tom said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hadn't got candles enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would slip in the kitchen and get some more.
<p/>But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.
<p/>I didn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must crawl to where Jim was, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hands and knees, and play something on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.
<p/>As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house.
<p/>Tom said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) slipped Jim's hat off of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head and hung it on a limb right over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and Jim stirred a little, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) didn't wake.
<p/>Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) in a trance, and rode him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) all over the State, and then set him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) under the trees again, and hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hat on a limb to show who done it.
<p/>And next time Jim told it he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said they rode him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) told it he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) spread it more and more, till by and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said they rode him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) all over the world, and tired him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) most to death, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) back was all over saddle-boils.
<p/>Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was more looked up to than any nigger in that country.
<p/>Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) all over, same as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was a wonder.
<p/>Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, <div class="bookquote">``Hm!
<p/>Jim always kept that five-center piece round his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own hands, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wanted to just by saying something to it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) never told what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) said to it.
<p/>Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the devil had had his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hands on it.
<p/>Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.
<p/>Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand.
<p/>We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.
<p/>So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.
<p/>We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes.
<p/>What you know `bout witches?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees.
<p/>Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.
<p/>We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.
<p/>We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom says: <div class="bookquote">``Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.
<p/>Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) name in blood. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>Everybody was willing.
<p/>It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) family must do it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mustn't eat and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mustn't sleep till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band.
<p/>And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must be sued; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) done it again he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must be killed.
<p/>And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must have his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) throat cut, and then have his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.
<p/>So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had wrote the oath on, and read it. Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, some of it, but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.
<p/>Some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took a pencil and wrote it in.
<p/>Then Ben Rogers says: <div class="bookquote">``Here's Huck Finn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) hain't got no family; what you going to do `bout him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben Rogers</b></font>)</div>'' Well, hain't he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) got a father?'' says Tom Sawyer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more.
<p/>They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others.
<p/>'' Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s got a father, but you can't never find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) these days. '' Well, nobody could think of anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.
<p/>I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson
<p/>Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.
<p/>--they could kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>). Everybody said: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)'ll do. That's all right. Huck can come in. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>'' Now,'' says Ben Rogers, <div class="bookquote">``what's the line of business of this Gang?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ben Rogers</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Nothing only robbery and murder,'' Tom said. '' But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery
<p/>We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.
<p/>; it's burglary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>says Tom Sawyer. '' We ain't burglars. That ain't no sort of style. We are highwaymen. '' <div class="bookquote">``Must we always kill the people?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Some authorities</b></font>)</div><p/>Some authorities think different, but mostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.
<p/>'' Oh, certainly. It's best. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ransomed? What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. But that's what they do. I've seen it in books; and so of course that's what we've got to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, blame it all, we've got to do it.
<p/>Don't I tell you it's in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books, and get things all muddled up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, that's all very fine to say , Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it to them?--that's the thing I want to get at.
<p/>'' Now, what do you reckon it is?'' '' Well, I don't know. But per`aps if we keep them till they're ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead.''
<p/>We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.''
<p/>How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?
<p/>``Now, that's something like . That'll answer. Why couldn't you said that before? <div class="bookquote">``How you talk, Ben Rogers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A guard!
<p/>Well, that is good. So somebody's got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.
<p/>I think that's foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Because it ain't in the books so --that's why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don't you?--that's the idea.
<p/>Don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do? Do you reckon you can learn 'em anything?
<p/>Not by a good deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way. '' '' All right.
<p/>I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?'' '' Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you
<p/>You fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.''
<p/>I wouldn't let on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. '' Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.
<p/>Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers.
<p/>Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) up he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) was scared, and cried, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) wanted to go home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) ma, and didn't want to be a robber any more.
<p/>So they all made fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>), and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) cry-baby, and that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) mad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) would go straight and tell all the secrets.
<p/>But Tom give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.
<p/>Ben Rogers said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing.
<p/>They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.
<p/>But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say. '' I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking.
<p/>WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes; but the widow she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) didn't scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could.
<p/>My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired. CHAPTER III. Then Miss Watson she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn't so. I tried it.
<p/>Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn't any good to me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn't make it work.
<p/>By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said I was a fool. She (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) never told me why, and I couldn't make it out no way.
<p/>I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Winn</b></font>) lost on pork?
<p/>I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it. Why can't the widow get back her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) silver snuffbox that was stole?
<p/>I went and told the widow about it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) said the thing a body could get by praying for it was <div class="bookquote">``spiritual gifts.
<p/>This was too many for me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) told me what she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself.
<p/>Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.
<p/>I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go.
<p/>Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again.
<p/>I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's Providence, but
<p/>I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow's if he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was a-going to be any better off then than what he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.
<p/>Pap he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for me; I didn't want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) no more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) used to always whale me when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was sober and could get his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hands on me; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was around.
<p/>if Miss Watson's got him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) there warn't no help for him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) any more. Well, about this time he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so people said.
<p/>They judged it was him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), anyway; said this drownded man was just his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so long
<p/>it warn't much like a face at all. They said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was floating on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back in the water. They took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and buried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the bank.
<p/>But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, but on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes. So I was uncomfortable again.
<p/>I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't. We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.
<p/>We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them.
<p/>Tom Sawyer called the hogs <div class="bookquote">``ingots,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) called the turnips and stuff <div class="bookquote">``julery,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked.
<p/>All the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but only just pretended. But I couldn't see no profit in it.
<p/>One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) called a slogan -LRB-which was the sign for the Gang to get together-RRB-, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had got secret news by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand <div class="bookquote">``sumter''  (<font color='red'><b>merchants A-rabs</b></font>)</div>mules, all
<p/>loaded down with di`monds, and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) never could go after even a turnip-cart
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before.
<p/>I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.
<p/>But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that.
<p/>We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rogers</b></font>) said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things.
<p/>I didn't see no di`monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) said it was all done by enchantment. I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians.
<p/>Why,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson.
<p/>Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.
<p/>'' '' Well,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``s`pose we got some genies to help us --can't we lick the other crowd then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How you going to get them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do it.
<p/>They don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any other man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. How do they get them?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' Who makes them tear around so?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di`monds, and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor's daughter from China for you to marry, they've got to do it--and they've got to do it before sun-up next morning, too.
<p/>They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) says. And more: they've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you understand.
<p/>Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, <div class="bookquote">``I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves `stead of fooling them away like that.
<p/>And what's more--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you'd have to come when he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.
<p/>All right, then; I would come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' ``What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? <div class="bookquote">``Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.
<p/>I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it.
<p/>I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't no use, none of the genies come.
<p/>You don't seem to know anything, somehow--perfect saphead. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies.
<p/>I reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) believed in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It had all the marks of a Sunday-school.
<p/>I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever.
<p/>CHAPTER IV. WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now. I don't take no stock in mathematics, anyway.
<p/>Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up.
<p/>At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. So the longer I went to school the easier
<p/>it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me.
<p/>Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to me.
<p/>I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory.
<p/>I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) warn't ashamed of me. One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!
<p/>The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.
<p/>I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.
<p/>There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence.
<p/>They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden fence.
<p/>There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody's tracks. It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so.
<p/>I couldn't make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.
<p/>I didn't notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.
<p/>I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my shoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody.
<p/>I was at Judge Thatcher's as quick as I could get there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.
<p/>Did you come for your interest?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' No, sir,'' I says; <div class="bookquote">``is there some for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty dollars.
<p/>Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you'll spend it.''
<p/>'' No, sir,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to spend it. I don't want it at all--nor the six thousand, nuther.
<p/>I want you to take it; I want to give it to you--the six thousand and all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked surprised.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) couldn't seem to make it out. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, what can you mean, my boy? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I says, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you ask me no questions about it, please.
<p/>You'll take it--won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm puzzled. Is something the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Please take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, <div class="bookquote">``and don't ask me nothing--then I won't have to tell no lies.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) studied a while, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says: ``Oho-o! I think I see. You want to sell all your property to me--not give it.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says: <div class="bookquote">``There; you see it says `for a consideration.'
<p/>That's the correct idea. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it. Here's a dollar for you.
<p/>Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) used to do magic with it.
<p/>Now you sign it. '' So I signed it, and left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything.
<p/>So I went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) that night and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) pap was here again, for I found his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) tracks in the snow.
<p/>Jim got out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hair-ball and said something over it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) held it up and dropped it on the floor.
<p/>What I wanted to know was, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was going to do, and was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) going to stay? It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.
<p/>Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. Jim got down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knees, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ear against it and listened.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time.
<p/>But it warn't no use; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said it wouldn't talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money. -LRB-I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.-RRB-
<p/>I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference.
<p/>Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.
<p/>Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it. Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again.
<p/>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said the hair-ball was all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.
<p/>I says, go on. So the hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Yo' ole father doan' know yit what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s a-gwyne to do.

<p/>there sat pap his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) own self! CHAPTER V. I had shut the door to. Then I turned around and there he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) was.
<p/>I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) being so unexpected; but right away after I see
<p/>I used to be scared of him (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) all the time, he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) tanned me so much. I warn't scared of him (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) worth bothring about.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) hair was long and tangled and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) eyes shining through like he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) was behind vines.
<p/>There warn't no color in his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) face, where his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) face showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) was most fifty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) looked it. It was all black, no gray; so was his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) long, mixed-up whiskers. As for his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) clothes--just rags, that was all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) had one ankle resting on t`other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) toes stuck through, and he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) worked them now and then.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) hat was laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid. I stood a-looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) set there a-looking at me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) chair tilted back a little.
<p/>I set the candle down. I noticed the window was up; so he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) had clumb in by the shed. He (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) kept a-looking me all over.
<p/>By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Starchy clothes--very. You think you're a good deal of a big-bug, don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Maybe I am, maybe I ain't,'' I says.
<p/>'' Don't you give me none o' your lip,'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). '' You've put on considerable many frills since I been away.
<p/>I'll take you down a peg before I get done with you. You're educated, too, they say--can read and write. You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can't?
<p/>I'll take it out of you. Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness, hey?--who told you you could?''
<p/>The widow, hey?--and who told the widow she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) could put in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) shovel about a thing that ain't none of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) business?''

<p/>None of the family couldn't before they died. I can't; and here you're a-swelling yourself up like this. I ain't the man to stand it--you hear?
<p/>When I'd read about a half a minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fetched the book a whack with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and knocked it across the house.
<p/>Say, lemme hear you read. '' I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``It's so.

<p/>I bet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done with you. Why, there ain't no end to your airs--they say you're rich.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was going down town to get some whisky; said he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) hadn't had a drink all day.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had got out on the shed he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>); and when I reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was gone
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) come back and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) head in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't drop that.
<p/>Next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was drunk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>), and tried to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>) give up the money; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>) couldn't,
<p/>The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had just come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) didn't know the old man
<p/>; so he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'d druther not take a child away from its father.
<p/>I want it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' and then he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) swore he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'d make the law force him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>). So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business.
<p/>That pleased the old man till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), and next day they had him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) before court, and jailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) again for a week.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was satisfied; said he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was boss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>)'d make it warm for him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) .
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) own house, and dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) up clean and nice, and had him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old pie to him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), so to speak.
<p/>And after supper he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d been a fool, and fooled away his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped the judge would help him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) and not look down on him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>).
<p/>The judge said he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could hug him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) for them words; so he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) cried, and his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) wife she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cried again; pap said he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) believed it.
<p/>The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried again.
<p/>And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.
<p/>There's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more; it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new life, and'll die before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll go back.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got out the new judge said he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was a-going to make a man of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). You mark them words--
<p/>don't forget I said them. It's a clean hand now; shake it--don't be afeard. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.
<p/>The judge's wife she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kissed it. Then the old man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) signed a pledge--made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something like that.
<p/>Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) after sun-up.
<p/>And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it. The judge he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) felt kind of sore.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't know no other way.
<p/>WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) give up that money, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) went for me, too, for not stopping school.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) or outrun him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) most of the time.
<p/>CHAPTER VI. I didn't want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business--appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it; so every now
<p/>Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) got money he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) got drunk; and every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) got drunk he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) raised Cain around town; and every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) raised Cain he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) got jailed.
<p/>and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), to keep from getting a cowhiding. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was just suited--this kind of thing was right in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) line.
<p/>and so she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) at last that if he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) didn't quit using around there she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would make trouble for him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) got to hanging around the widow's too much Well, wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) mad? He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) would show who was Huck Finn's boss.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't
<p/>no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) kept me with him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) always locked the door and put the key under his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) head nights.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had a gun which he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.
<p/>Every little while he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me.
<p/>The widow she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) found out where I was by and by, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.
<p/>Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time.
<p/>It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor study. I didn't want to go back no more.
<p/>I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't no objections.
<p/>It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it all around. But by and by pap got too handy with his (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) hick`ry, and I couldn't stand it.
<p/>I was all over welts. He (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) locked me in and was gone three days.
<p/>It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had got drownded, and I wasn't ever going to get out any more. I was scared.
<p/>I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way.
<p/>There warn't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn't get up the chimbly; it was too narrow.
<p/>Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time.
<p/>But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof.
<p/>There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out.
<p/>I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom
<p/>The door was thick, solid oak slabs. I greased it up and went to work. log out--big enough to let me through.
<p/>Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods.
<p/>I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.
<p/>Pap warn't in a good humor --so he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) natural self. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was down town, and everything was going wrong.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lawyer said he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would win his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>) said people allowed there'd be another trial to get me away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>) and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time.
<p/>This shook me up considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.
<p/>Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't skipped any, and after that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't know the names of, and so called them
<p/>what's-his-name when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got to them, and went right along with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cussing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would like to see the widow get me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped
<p/>That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got that chance.
<p/>and they couldn't find me. The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had got.
<p/>There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow.
<p/>I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away.
<p/>I guessed I wouldn't stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn't ever find me any more.
<p/>I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would.
<p/>I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.
<p/>I got so full of it I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.
<p/>While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a sight to look at.
<p/>Whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liquor begun to work he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most always went for the govment, this time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Call this a govment!
<p/>A body would a thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Adam--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was just all mud. why, just look at it and see what it's like.
<p/>Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--a man's own son, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising.
<p/>Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a rest, the law up and goes for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>And they call that govment! That ain't all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>) to keep me out
<p/>Here's what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up`ards, and jams him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog.
<p/>o' my property. They call that govment! A man can't get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all.
<p/>Yes, and I told 'em so ; I told old Thatcher so to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>) face. Lots of 'em heard me, and can tell what I said.
<p/>I says look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stove-pipe.
<p/>Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.
<p/>Says I, for two cents I'd leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them's the very words. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as a white man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.
<p/>And what do you think? They said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a p`fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.
<p/>And that ain't the wust. They said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could vote when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to?
<p/>It was `lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out.
<p/>I says I'll never vote agin. Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me--
<p/>And to see the cool way of that nigger--why, he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) out o' the way.
<p/>I'll never vote agin as long as I live. I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold?--that's what I want to know.
<p/>Why, they said he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) couldn't be sold till he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'d been in the State six months, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) hadn't been there that long yet.
<p/>And what do you reckon they said? There, now--that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'s been in the State six months.
<p/>Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and--
<p/>so he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) never noticed where his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) old limber legs was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) to, so he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, and the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) speech was all the hottest kind of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) give the tub some, too, all along, here and there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) let out with his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.
<p/>But it warn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) toes; and the cussing he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) done then laid over anything he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) had ever done previous.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) best days, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said it laid over him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>), too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.
<p/>'' Pap was agoing on He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said so his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) own self afterwards. After supper pap took the jug, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens.
<p/>I judged he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t`other.
<p/>That was always his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) word. He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) drank and drank, and tumbled down on his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time.
<p/>At last I got so sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about
<p/>I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up.
<p/>I was sound asleep, and the candle burning. There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said they was crawling up his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) legs; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) started and run round and round the cabin, hollering <div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) off! take him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) off! he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'s biting me on the neck!
<p/>Pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was laying over by the corner. By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raised up part way and listened, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head to one side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says, very low: <div class="bookquote">``Tramp--tramp--tramp; that's the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they're coming after me; but I won't go. Oh, they're here! don't touch me--
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) alone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) rolled himself up in his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) went to crying.
<p/>don't! hands off-- they're cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) through the blanket.
<p/>By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) rolled out and jumped up on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) feet looking wild, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) see me and went for me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) would kill me, and then I couldn't come for him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) no more.
<p/>I begged, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) I was only Huck; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) laughed such a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up.
<p/>Once when I turned short and dodged under his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself.
<p/>Pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) was all tired out, and dropped down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) back against the door, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) would rest a minute and then kill me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) knife under him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>), and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) would sleep and get strong, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) would see who was who.
<p/>By and by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the gun.
<p/>I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) to stir.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) dozed off pretty soon. And how slow and still the time did drag along. CHAPTER VII. '' GIT up!
<p/>What you `bout? '' I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.
<p/>'' I judged he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) didn't know nothing about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) had been doing, so I says: <div class="bookquote">``Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) says: ``What you doin' with this gun? <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you roust me out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Don't stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast.
<p/>'' Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budge you.'' '' Well, all right. I'll be along in a minute.
<p/>I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town.
<p/>The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill.
<p/>I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t`other one out for what the rise might fetch along.
<p/>Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck.
<p/>I just expected there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>).
<p/>I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. But it warn't so this time.
<p/>It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees this--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s worth ten dollars.
<p/>But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows
<p/>, I struck another idea: I judged I'd hide her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) good, and then, `stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.
<p/>It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I fell in the river, and that was what made me so long.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't seen anything. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got along I was hard at it taking up a <div class="bookquote">``trot''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>line. I knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would see I was wet, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be asking questions.
<p/>While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen.
<p/>Well, I didn't see no way for a while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you hear?
<p/>We got five catfish off the lines and went home. That man warn't here for no good. I'd a shot him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been saying give me the very idea I wanted.
<p/>Next time you roust me out, you hear? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won't think of following me.
<p/>About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the rise.
<p/>By and by along comes part of a log raft --nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.
<p/>Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn't pap's style.
<p/>Then we had dinner. Nine logs was enough for one time; he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) must shove right over to town and sell. So he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.
<p/>I waited till I reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was t`other side of the river I was out of the hole; him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.
<p/>I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of bacon;
<p/>I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.
<p/>I judged he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wouldn't come back that night. then the whisky-jug. I took fish-lines and matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.
<p/>I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.
<p/>I cleaned out the place. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done. I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things.
<p/>So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust.
<p/>Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn't quite touch ground.
<p/>If you stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't
<p/>likely anybody would go fooling around there. It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.
<p/>So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms.
<p/>I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. I shot this fellow and took him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) into camp.
<p/>I fetched the pig in, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back nearly to the table and hacked into his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) throat with the axe, and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed, and no boards.
<p/>Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight.
<p/>I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it. You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground.
<p/>I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy touches.
<p/>Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.
<p/>Then I took up the pig and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) to my breast with my jacket -LRB-so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) couldn't drip-RRB- till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) into the river.
<p/>So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.
<p/>I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't
<p/>Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that. Now I thought of something else. no knives and forks on the place--pap done everything with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) clasp-knife about the cooking.
<p/>Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.
<p/>There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.
<p/>The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident.
<p/>Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.
<p/>It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.
<p/>I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.
<p/>I says to myself, they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me.
<p/>And they'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things.
<p/>They won't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't bother no more about me.
<p/>All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there.
<p/>And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the place.
<p/>I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.
<p/>The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore.
<p/>I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and smelt late.
<p/>I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water.
<p/>You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out.
<p/>It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.
<p/>I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water. I couldn't tell how many was in it.
<p/>It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it. Think's I
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dropped below me with the current, and by and by he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>, maybe it's pap, though I warn't expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Well, it was pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) oars.
<p/>I didn't lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank.
<p/>I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me.
<p/>I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it.
<p/>The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.
<p/>I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) float. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!
<p/>I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too-- every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now.
<p/>T'other one said this warn't one of the short ones, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reckoned--and then they laughed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and laughed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) didn't laugh; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ripped out something brisk, and said let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) alone.
<p/>The first fellow said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) `lowed to tell it to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) old woman--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would think it was pretty good; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said that warn't nothing to some things he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had said in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) time.
<p/>I heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about a week longer.
<p/>After that the talk got further and further away, and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.
<p/>I rose up, and there was Jackson's Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights.
<p/>I was away below the ferry now. There warn't any signs of the bar at the head--it was all under water now.
<p/>I shot past the head at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.
<p/>I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside.
<p/>I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.
<p/>A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it.
<p/>It didn't take me long to get there. I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood
<p/>I heard a man say, <div class="bookquote">``Stern oars, there! heave her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head to stabboard! ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side.
<p/>There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast.
<p/>I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.
<p/>I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.
<p/>There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII. THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o'clock. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly.
<p/>I was powerful lazy and comfortable --didn't want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of <div class="bookquote">``boom!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.
<p/>I hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.
<p/>And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. '' Boom! ''
<p/>I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.
<p/>I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke.
<p/>The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat.
<p/>Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there.
<p/>So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.
<p/>So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn't disappointed.
<p/>A big double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) floated out further.
<p/>Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore--I knowed enough for that. But by and by along comes another one, and this time I won.
<p/>I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was <div class="bookquote">``baker's bread'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--what the quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.
<p/>I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.
<p/>I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone and done it.
<p/>So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for only just the right kind.
<p/>The ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) come along, because she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) would come in close, where the bread did.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.
<p/>And then something struck me. I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. Where the log forked I could peep through.
<p/>By and by she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) come along, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore.
<p/>Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.
<p/>Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says: <div class="bookquote">``Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.
<p/>They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.
<p/>Most everybody was on the boat. I hope so, anyway. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>I didn't hope so. I could see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.
<p/>Then the captain sung out: <div class="bookquote">``Stand away!''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone.
<p/>If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to goodness.
<p/>I could hear the booming now and then, further and further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.
<p/>The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island. The island was three mile long.
<p/>They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.
<p/>I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn't yet a while. I crossed over to that side and watched them.
<p/>When they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town.
<p/>I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods.
<p/>I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn't get at them.
<p/>I catched a catfish and haggled him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper.
<p/>When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed
<p/>; there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can't stay so, you soon get over it.
<p/>Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast. And so for three days and nights. No difference--just the same thing.
<p/>I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.
<p/>I found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.
<p/>But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. They would all come handy by and by, I judged.
<p/>Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't far from the foot of the island.
<p/>I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home.
<p/>About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it.
<p/>I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.
<p/>I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could.
<p/>Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear nothing else.
<p/>My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on.
<p/>If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two
<p/>and I only got half, and the short half, too. When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there
<p/>So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.
<p/>warn't much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing, I didn't hear nothing
<p/>Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time.
<p/>--I only thought I heard and seen as much as a thousand things. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.
<p/>So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.
<p/>By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind
<p/>I would stay there all night when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk , and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices.
<p/>I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out.
<p/>I hadn't got far when I hear a man say: <div class="bookquote">``We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out.
<p/>Let's look around. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.
<p/>I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.
<p/>By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me
<p/>So the sleep didn't do me no good. ; I'll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.
<p/>So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.
<p/>The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep.
<p/>Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done.
<p/>I give her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a turn with the paddle and brung her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods.
<p/>I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river.
<p/>So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen.
<p/>But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place.
<p/>But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow.
<p/>By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fan-tods.
<p/>I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and kept my eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steady.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a blanket around his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head was nearly in the fire. It was getting gray daylight now.
<p/>Pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>I says: <div class="bookquote">``Hello, Jim!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and skipped out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) drops down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knees, and puts his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hands together and says: <div class="bookquote">``Doan' hurt me--don't!
<p/>I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'. I alwuz liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em.
<p/>You go en git in de river agin, whah you b`longs, en doan ' do nuffn to Ole Jim, `at `uz awluz yo' fren'.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well, I warn't long making him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) understand I warn't dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn't lonesome now.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) I warn't afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) only set there and looked at me; never said nothing.
<p/>Then I says: <div class="bookquote">``It's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck?
<p/>But you got a gun, hain't you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.'' <div class="bookquote">``Strawberries and such truck,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says.
<p/>'' Is that what you live on?'' <div class="bookquote">``I couldn' git nuffn else,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) says. '' Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come heah de night arter you's killed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, all that time?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes--indeedy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sah--nuffn else. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?'' '' I reck'n I could eat a hoss.
<p/>I think I could. How long you ben on de islan'?'' '' Since the night I got killed.'' <div class="bookquote">``No! W`y, what has you lived on?
<p/>But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat's good. Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.
<p/>So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Dat</b></font>) built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) reckoned it was all done with witchcraft.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knife, and fried him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.
<p/>Jim laid it in with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) might, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.
<p/>By and by Jim says: <div class="bookquote">``But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat `uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn't
<p/>you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>Then I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) the whole thing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) said it was smart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had.
<p/>Then I says: <div class="bookquote">``How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Maybe I better not tell. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, Jim? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, dey's reasons. But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blamed if I would, Jim.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I b`lieve you, Huck. I-- I run off .'' <div class="bookquote">``Jim!''  (<font color='red'><b>Huck/Huck Creeps</b></font>)</div>'' But mind, you said you wouldn' tell--you know you said you wouldn' tell, Huck.
<p/>'' '' Well, I did. I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it. Honest injun , I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum--but that don't make no difference.
<p/>I ain't a-going to tell, and I ain't a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le's know all about it. '' ''
<p/>--she (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) awluz said she (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) wouldn' sell me down to Orleans.
<p/>Well, you see, it `uz dis way. Ole missus-- dat's Miss Watson But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy.
<p/>quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) didn' want to, but she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it `uz sich a big stack o' money she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) couldn' resis'.
<p/>De widder she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) try to git her (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) to say she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'.
<p/>Well, one night I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.
<p/>I tuck out en shin down de hill, en `spec to steal a skift `long de sho' som`ers `bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go `way.
<p/>'' Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time. ' Long `bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en `bout eight er
<p/>nine every skift dat went `long wuz talkin' `bout how yo' pap come over to de town en say you's killed.
<p/>Dese las' skifts wuz full o ' ladies en genlmen a-goin' over for to see de place. Sometimes dey'd pull up at de sho' en take
<p/>a res' b`fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all `bout de killin'. I `uz powerful
<p/>sorry you's killed, Huck, but I ain't no mo' now. '' I laid dah under de shavin's all day. I `uz hungry, but I warn't afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus
<p/>en de widder wuz goin' to start to de camp -meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle `bout daylight, so
<p/>dey wouldn' `spec to see me roun' de place, en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'.
<p/>De yuther servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks `uz out'n de way.
<p/>'' Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went `bout two mile er more to whah dey
<p/>warn't no houses. I'd made up my mine `bout what I's agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to git away afoot
<p/>, de dogs `ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey'd miss dat skift, you see, en
<p/>dey'd know `bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side, en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I's arter; it doan' make no track.
<p/>'' I see a light a-comin' roun' de p`int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove' a log ahead o' me en swum
<p/>more'n half way acrost de river, en got in `mongst de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swum agin
<p/>de current tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en `uz pooty dark for a little while.
<p/>So I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De men `uz all `way yonder in de middle, whah de lantern wuz.
<p/>De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a good current; so I reck'n'd `at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five mile down de river, en den
<p/>I'd slip in jis b`fo' daylight en swim asho', en take to de woods on de Illinois side. '' But I didn' have no luck.
<p/>When we `uz mos' down to de head er de islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern , I see it warn't
<p/>no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'. Well, I had a notion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but I couldn't--bank too bluff.
<p/>I `uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b`fo ' I found' a good place. I went into de woods en
<p/>jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo', long as dey move de lantern roun' so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg,

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, that's so. You've had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?''
<p/>'' Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah--watched um thoo de bushes. '' Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it.
<p/>Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn't let me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) old granny said his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) father would die, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) did.
<p/>And Jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.
<p/>Jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said it was death. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.
<p/>I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) if there warn't any good-luck signs.
<p/>Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knowed most everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Mighty few--an' dey ain't no use to a body.
<p/>What you want to know when good luck's a-comin' for? Want to keep it off? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas'

<p/>Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted out. '' '' What did you speculate in, Jim?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b`longs to old Misto Bradish?
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year.
<p/>Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn't have much. I wuz de on'y one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars, en
<p/>I said 'f I didn' git it I'd start a bank mysef. Well, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er de business, bekase
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) says dey warn't business `nough for two banks, so he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) say I could put in my five dollars en he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) pay me thirty-five at de en' er de year.

<p/>'' Well, I `uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name' Balum
<p/>--Balum's Ass dey call him (<font color='blue'><b>Ass</b></font>) for short ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ass</b></font>)'s one er dem chuckleheads, you know. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ass</b></font>)'s lucky, dey say, en
<p/>I see I warn't lucky. De dream say let Balum inves' de ten cents en he (<font color='blue'><b>Ass</b></font>)'d make a raise for me.
<p/>Well, Balum he (<font color='blue'><b>Ass</b></font>) tuck de money, en when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ass</b></font>) wuz in church he (<font color='blue'><b>Ass</b></font>) hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de Lord, en boun' to git his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) money back a hund'd times.
<p/>So Balum he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) tuck en give de ten cents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it.
<p/>'' '' Well, what did come of it, Jim?'' '' Nuffn never come of it. I couldn' manage to k`leck dat money no way
<p/>; en Balum he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) couldn'. I ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money `dout I see de security. Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times, de preacher says!
<p/>Ef I could git de ten cents back , I'd call it squah, en be glad er de chanst.'' '' Well, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be rich again some time or other.''
<p/>'' Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it. I owns mysef, en I's wuth eight hund'd dollars. I wisht I had de money
<p/>I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.
<p/>, I wouldn' want no mo'. '' CHAPTER IX. This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high.
<p/>We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois.
<p/>We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.
<p/>Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.
<p/>Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs.
<p/>And, besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?
<p/>So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there.
<p/>It was cool in there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.
<p/>The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good place to build a fire on.
<p/>We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner. So we built it there and cooked dinner.
<p/>We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.
<p/>Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow
<p/>It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest-- FST !
<p/>it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.
<p/>so. It was one of these regular summer storms. '' Jim, this is nice,'' I says. '' I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but here.
<p/>Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread. '' '' Well, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for Jim.
<p/>You'd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn' mos' drownded, too; dat you would, honey. Chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile.
<p/>'' The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last it was over the banks.
<p/>On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs.
<p/>The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe
<p/>We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way.
<p/>Well, on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would slide off in the water.
<p/>, It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.
<p/>We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them. One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.
<p/>It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.
<p/>We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.
<p/>Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.
<p/>But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) to wait for daylight.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was a two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window. The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.
<p/>We could make out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there was clothes hanging against the wall.
<p/>Then we looked in at the window. There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man.
<p/>So Jim says: <div class="bookquote">``Hello, you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>But it didn't budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says: <div class="bookquote">``De man ain't asleep--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s dead.
<p/>You hold still-- I'll go en see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) went, and bent down and looked, and says: <div class="bookquote">``It's a dead man.
<p/>Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s ben shot in de back. I reck'n he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan' look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) face--it's too gashly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I didn't look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) needn't done it; I didn't want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.
<p/>There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing, too.
<p/>We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good. There was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.
<p/>And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck.
<p/>We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.
<p/>The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.
<p/>We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.
<p/>The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other one, though we hunted all around.
<p/>They stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account. And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.
<p/>we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) set up people could tell he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was a nigger a good ways off.
<p/>When we was ready to shove off I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it.
<p/>I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody. We got home all safe.
<p/>AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come to be killed, but Jim didn't want to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) might come and ha`nt us; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said a man that warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha`nting around than one that was planted and comfortable.
<p/>That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.
<p/>We rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.
<p/>Jim said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed the money was there they wouldn't a left it.
<p/>I says: <div class="bookquote">``Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?
<p/>CHAPTER X. I said I reckoned they killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), too; but Jim didn't want to talk about that. You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands.
<p/>Well, here's your bad luck! We've raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don't you git too peart. It's a-comin'. Mind I tell you, it's a-comin'. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco.
<p/>It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. I went to the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there.
<p/>I killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and curled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) up on the foot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun when Jim found him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) there.
<p/>Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake's mate was there, and bit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring.
<p/>I laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) out in a second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pour it down.
<p/>That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.
<p/>Jim told me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was barefooted, and the snake bit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) right on the heel. I done it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) eat it and said it would help cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) made me take off the rattles and tie them around his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wrist, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said that that would help. Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and
<p/>now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) come to himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) went to sucking at the jug again.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was all right;
<p/>but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky. Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was around again.
<p/>I wouldn't ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) druther see the new moon over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.
<p/>Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>) got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>) was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>) edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him (<font color='blue'><b>Bunker</b></font>) so, so they say, but I didn't see it.
<p/>I made up my mind Jim said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) reckoned I would believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) next time. Pap told me. But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.
<p/>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds.
<p/>We couldn't handle him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), of course; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rip and tear around till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drownded.
<p/>We found a brass button in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it.
<p/>Jim said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.
<p/>Jim said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hadn't ever seen a bigger one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would a been worth a good deal over at the village.
<p/>They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) meat's as white as snow and makes a good fry.
<p/>Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) studied it over and said, couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?
<p/>Jim liked that notion; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said I must go in the dark and look sharp. That was a good notion, too.
<p/>So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.
<p/>I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.
<p/>Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.
<p/>I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.
<p/>I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.
<p/>I took notice, and done better. I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark. I tied up and started along the bank.
<p/>There was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there.
<p/>I slipped up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table.
<p/>I didn't know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.
<p/>Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out.
<p/>But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind
<p/>I wouldn't forget I was a girl. CHAPTER XI. <div class="bookquote">``COME in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>says the woman, and I did. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Take a cheer.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>I done it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked me all over with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little shiny eyes, and says: <div class="bookquote">``What might your name be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sarah Williams. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where `bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?' ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No'm. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I've walked all the way
<p/>I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more.
<p/>and I'm all tired out.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hungry, too, I reckon. I'll find you something.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No'm, I ain't hungry. It's what makes me so late.
<p/>My mother's down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>) lives at the upper end of the town, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says.
<p/>I hain't ever been here before. Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Moore</b></font>)?'' '' No; but I don't know everybody yet. I haven't lived here quite two weeks.
<p/>It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You better stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wouldn't let me go by myself, but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband would be in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d send him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) along with me.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got to talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, and about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) relations up the river, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) relations down the river, and about how much better off they used to was, and how they didn't know
<p/>but they'd made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to find out what was going on in the town; but by and by she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dropped on to pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) clatter right along.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars -LRB-only she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got it ten-RRB- and all about pap and what a hard lot he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got down to where I was murdered.
<p/>'' No,'' I says; <div class="bookquote">``I'll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. I ain't afeared of the dark. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says: <div class="bookquote">``Who done it?
<p/>We've heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people here that'd like to know who killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>). Some think old Finn done it himself.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--is that so?''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>'' Most everybody thought it at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>)'ll never know how nigh he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) come to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) run on, and never noticed I had put in at all: <div class="bookquote">``The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) --''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. So there's a reward out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>)--three hundred dollars.
<p/>You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away after he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) up and left.
<p/>And there's a reward out for old Finn, too--two hundred dollars. Before night they wanted to lynch him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) was gone, you see.
<p/>Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done.
<p/>So then they put it on him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>), you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with.
<p/>The judge gave him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) some, and that evening he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) hain't come back sence, and they ain't looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) killed his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'d get Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
<p/>People do say he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) warn't any too good to do it. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'s sly, I reckon. If he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) don't come back for a year he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'ll be all right.
<p/>You can't prove anything on him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'ll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing.''
<p/>'' Yes, I reckon so, 'm. I don't see nothing in the way of it. Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?''
<p/>'' Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) done it. But they'll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, are they after him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, you're innocent, ain't you! Does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up?
<p/>A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island.
<p/>Some folks think the nigger ain't far from here. I'm one of them--but I hain't talked it around. Don't anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they.
<p/>I didn't say any more, but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that,
<p/>so I says to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.
<p/>I hain't seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'s gone, if it was him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>); but husband's going over to see--him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and another man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was gone up the river; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got back to-day, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got here two hours ago.
<p/>I had to do something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it.
<p/>'' I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it.
<p/>I put down the needle and thread, and let on to be interested--and I was, too--and says: <div class="bookquote">``Three hundred dollars is a power of money.
<p/>When the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little. I wish my mother could get it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun.
<p/>Is your husband going over there to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, yes. They'll go over after midnight.'' <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After midnight he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) camp fire all the better for the dark, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s got one.''
<p/>'' Yes. And couldn't the nigger see better, too? <div class="bookquote">``I didn't think of that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a bit comfortable.
<p/>Pretty soon she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``What did you say your name was, honey?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``M--Mary Williams. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before,
<p/>so I didn't look up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.
<p/>I wished the woman would say something more; the longer she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) set still the uneasier I was. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah's my first name. Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, that's the way of it?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I couldn't look up yet.
<p/>Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was right about the rats. You'd see one stick his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nose out of a hole in the corner every little while.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had to have things handy to throw at them when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was alone, or they wouldn't give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) no peace.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a good shot with it generly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d wrenched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arm a day or two ago, and didn't know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could throw true now.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) missed him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wide, and said <div class="bookquote">``Ouch!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>it hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arm so. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn't let on.
<p/>I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose I let drive, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d a stayed where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d a been a tolerable sick rat. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said that was first-rate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reckoned I would hive the next one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted me to help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with.
<p/>I held up my two hands and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put the hank over them, and went on talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's matters.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) broke off to say: <div class="bookquote">``Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap, handy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my legs together on it
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Come, now, what's your real name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on talking. But only about a minute. '' Wh--what, mum?'' '' What's your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?
<p/>'' I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do. But I says: <div class="bookquote">``Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.
<p/>If I'm in the way here, I'll-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, you won't. Set down and stay where you are. I ain't going to hurt you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther.
<p/>You just tell me your secret, and trust me. I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll help you. So'll my old man if you want him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to.
<p/>You see, you're a runaway `prentice, that's all. It ain't anything. There ain't no harm in it. You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.
<p/>So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just make a clean breast and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) everything, but she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) musn't go back on her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) promise.
<p/>Then I told her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) my father and mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no longer
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.
<p/>I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.
<p/>I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.
<p/>Bless you, child, I wouldn't tell on you. Tell me all about it now, that's a good boy. '' '' Goshen, child?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen's ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?'' ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was drunk, I reckon. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told you just exactly wrong.'' '' Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did act like he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was drunk, but it ain't no matter now.
<p/>I got to be moving along. I'll fetch Goshen before daylight.'' ``Hold on a minute. I'll put you up a snack to eat.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put me up a snack, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets up first?
<p/>You might want it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Answer up prompt now--don't stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?'' <div class="bookquote">``The hind end, mum.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, then, a horse?'' '' The for`rard end, mum. '' '' Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``North side. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction?''
<p/>'' The whole fifteen, mum. '' '' Well, I reckon you have lived in the country. I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again.
<p/>Don't forget and tell me it's Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George Elexander when I catch you.
<p/>What's your real name, now?'' <div class="bookquote">``George Peters, mum.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/Jackson/George Jackson</b></font>)</div>'' Well, try to remember it, George. And don't go about women in that old calico.
<p/>Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t`other way.
<p/>And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot.
<p/>Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy.
<p/>You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lap
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throws her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees apart ; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) don't clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.
<p/>Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain.
<p/>Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out of it.
<p/>Keep the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one, and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.
<p/>I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.
<p/>'' I jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island, and then started across.
<p/>When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven.
<p/>When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.
<p/>Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half below, as hard as I could go.
<p/>I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then. I landed, and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern.
<p/>There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground. I roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) out and says: <div class="bookquote">``Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain't a minute to lose.
<p/>Jim never asked no questions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) never said a word; but the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) worked for the next half an hour showed about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was scared.
<p/>By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) was hid.
<p/>They're after us!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a candle outside after that.
<p/>I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't good to see by.
<p/>Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a word.
<p/>IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.
<p/>If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.
<p/>CHAPTER XII. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn't good judgment to put everything on the raft.
<p/>If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come.
<p/>Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine.
<p/>When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them
<p/>I played it as low down on them as I could. so she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there.
<p/>We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us.
<p/>We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.
<p/>I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a smart one, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to start after us herself she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wouldn't set down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d fetch a dog.
<p/>A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth. Well, then, I said, why couldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband to fetch a dog?
<p/>Jim said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) bet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog
<p/>and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.
<p/>When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry.
<p/>Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves.
<p/>Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.
<p/>So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something.
<p/>We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a <div class="bookquote">``crossing'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the channel, but hunted easy water.
<p/>This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour.
<p/>It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.
<p/>We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.
<p/>Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.
<p/>We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.
<p/>In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night.
<p/>Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting comfortable, and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) along.
<p/>Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot.
<p/>There warn't a sound there; everybody was asleep. I never see pap when he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) used to say, anyway.
<p/>Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind.
<p/>Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.
<p/>Jim said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.
<p/>So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what.
<p/>But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p`simmons. We warn't feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now.
<p/>I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p`simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.
<p/>We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.
<p/>The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet.
<p/>Take it all round, we lived pretty high. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.
<p/>When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, <div class="bookquote">``Hel- lo , Jim, looky yonder!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>). The lightning showed her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) very distinct.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) was leaning over, with part of her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.
<p/>, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.
<p/>Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like I wanted to get aboard of her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) and slink around a little, and see what there was there.
<p/>So I says: <div class="bookquote">``Le's land on her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>), Jim. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But Jim was dead against it at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``I doan' want to go fool'n `long er no wrack.
<p/>We's doin' blame' well, en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says. Like as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack.
<p/>Watchman your grandmother,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I says; <div class="bookquote">``there ain't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk his (<font color='blue'><b>Watchman</b></font>) life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' Jim couldn't say nothing to that, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) didn't try. '' And besides,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.
<p/>Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and they don't care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.
<p/>Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her (<font color='blue'><b>captains</b></font>) a rummaging.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d call it an adventure--that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d call it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d land on that wreck if it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) last act.
<p/>Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) wouldn't. And wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) throw style into it?--wouldn't
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer was here. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) grumbled a little, but give in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said we mustn't talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low.
<p/>The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there. The deck was high out here.
<p/>We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark we couldn't see no sign of them.
<p/>Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down through the texas-hall we see a light!
<p/>and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder! Jim whispered and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come along.
<p/>I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>You always want more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell.
<p/>Another voice said, pretty loud: <div class="bookquote">``It's a lie, Jim Turner. You've acted this way before. But this time you've said it jest
<p/>one time too many. You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>By this time Jim was gone for the raft.
<p/>I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now, and so I won't either
<p/>So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn't
<p/>Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and one of them had a dim lantern in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and the other one had a pistol.
<p/>; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and saying: <div class="bookquote">``I'd like to!
<p/>And I orter, too--a mean skunk!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, please don't, Bill; I hain't ever goin' to tell.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>And every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say: ''`Deed you ain't! You never said no truer thing 'n
<p/>that, you bet you. '' And once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beg! and yit if we hadn't got the best of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and tied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d a killed us both. And what for ? Jist for noth`n. Jist because we stood on our rights --that's what for.
<p/>But I lay you ain't a-goin' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put up that pistol, Bill. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Bill says: <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to, Jake Packard.
<p/>I'm for killin' him (<font color='blue'><b>Packard</b></font>)--and didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Packard</b></font>) kill old Hatfield jist the same way--and don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Packard</b></font>) deserve it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill</b></font>)</div>'' But I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Packard</b></font>) killed, and I've got my reasons for it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you long's I live!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man sort</b></font>)</div>says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.
<p/>Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come.
<p/>I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.
<p/>The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Packard</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Here--come in here. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And in he (<font color='blue'><b>Packard</b></font>) come, and Bill after him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>). But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.
<p/>Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.
<p/>I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I didn't breathe.
<p/>I was too scared. And, besides, a body couldn't breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner.
<p/>If we was to give both our shares to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) now it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way we've served him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'s said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'ll tell, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) will. Shore's you're born, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'ll turn State's evidence; now you hear me .
<p/>I'm for putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) troubles.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' So'm I,'' says Packard, very quiet. '' Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't.
<p/>Well, then, that's all right. Le's go and do it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit.
<p/>But what I say is this: it ain't good sense to go court'n around after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist as good and
<p/>You listen to me. Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's got to be done. at the same time don't bring you into no resks.
<p/>Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck.
<p/>Ain't that so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' You bet it is. But how you goin' to manage it this time?'' '' Then we'll wait.
<p/>Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.
<p/>See? He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own self. I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it ain't good sense, it ain't good morals.
<p/>Ain't I right?'' '' Yes, I reck'n you are. But s`pose she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) don't break up and wash off?'' '' Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see,
<p/>can't we?'' '' All right, then; come along. '' So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled forward.
<p/>'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says: ``Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the wreck
<p/>It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Jim! there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix.
<p/>But if we find their boat we can put all of 'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff 'll get 'em.
<p/>Quick--hurry! I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You start at the raft, and-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, my lordy, lordy! raf' ?
<p/>Dey ain' no raf' no mo' ; she (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) done broke loose en gone I-- en here we is!'' CHAPTER XIII. WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.
<p/>Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd got to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.
<p/>So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too--seemed a week before we got to the stern.
<p/>No sign of a boat. Jim said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) didn't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could go any further--so scared he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hadn't hardly any strength left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said.
<p/>But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again.
<p/>We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water.
<p/>When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>).
<p/>I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), but just then the door opened.
<p/>One of the men stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) jerked it in again, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set down. It was Packard.
<p/>Then Bill he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) come out and got in. Packard says, in a low voice: <div class="bookquote">``All ready--shove off! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Packard/Jake Packard</b></font>)</div>I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.
<p/>But Bill says: <div class="bookquote">``Hold on--'d you go through him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill</b></font>)</div>'' No. Didn't you?'' '' No. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)'s got his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) share o' the cash yet.''
<p/>'' Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.'' <div class="bookquote">``Say, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) suspicion what we're up to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) won't. But we got to have it anyway. Come along. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So they got out and went in. I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!
<p/>We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) up, every last sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), and we was safe, and knowed it.
<p/>When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.
<p/>We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even breathe. Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.
<p/>Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't had time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix.
<p/>I says to myself, there ain't no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would I like it?
<p/>So says I to Jim: <div class="bookquote">``The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this time worse than ever.
<p/>The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our raft.
<p/>After a long time the rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for it.
<p/>It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.
<p/>So I said I would go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck.
<p/>We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) judged he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light.
<p/>As I got down towards it three or four more showed--up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated.
<p/>I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) slept; and by and by I found him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) roosting on the bitts forward, with his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) head down between his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) knees.
<p/>As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. I gave his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to cry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) see it was only me he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) took a good gap and stretch, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) says: ``Hello, what's up?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dang it now, don't take on so; we all has to have our troubles, and this 'n 'll come out all right.
<p/>Don't cry, bub. What's the trouble? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I says: <div class="bookquote">``Pap, and mam, and sis, and-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then I broke down. What's the matter with 'em?''
<p/>I'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers.
<p/>I ain't as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' generous and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is, and slam around money the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) does;
<p/>but I've told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a many a time 't I wouldn't trade places with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); for, says I, a sailor's life's the life for me, and I'm derned if I'd live two mile out o' town, where there ain't nothing ever goin' on, not for all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spondulicks and as much more on top of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're-- they're--are you the watchman of the boat?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. '' Says I--'' I broke in and says: <div class="bookquote">``They're in an awful peck of trouble, and--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Who is?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take your ferryboat and go up there--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Up where? Where are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On the wreck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I bet they didn't! Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for 'em if they don't git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the edge of the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) started over with her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her
<p/>I disremember her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooker</b></font>) made a grab and got aboard the wreck.
<p/>Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so we saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Easy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill Whipple Easy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Booth's Landing--go on. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' and oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Booth</b></font>) was the best cretur!--I most wish 't it had been me, I do.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``My George! It's the beatenest thing I ever struck. And then what did you all do?''  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>'' Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear.
<p/>So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker
<p/>I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, `What, in such a night and such a current?
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooker</b></font>) said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooker</b></font>) uncle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'d fix the thing. There ain't no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.'
<p/>Now if you'll go and--'' <div class="bookquote">``By Jackson, I'd like to, and, blame it, I don't know but I will; but who in the dingnation's a-going' to pay for it?
<p/>Do you reckon your pap-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why that's all right. Miss Hooker she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooker</b></font>) tole me, particular , that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooker</b></font>) uncle Hornback--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Great guns!
<p/>Looky here, you break for that light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hornback</b></font>)'ll foot the bill.
<p/>is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hornback</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooker</b></font>) uncle? And don't you fool around any, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hornback</b></font>)'ll want to know the news. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hornback</b></font>) I'll have his (<font color='blue'><b>Hornback</b></font>) niece all safe before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hornback</b></font>) can get to town.
<p/>I struck for the light, but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hornback</b></font>) turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) out, and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start.
<p/>But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would a done it.
<p/>Hump yourself, now; I'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wished the widow knowed about it.
<p/>I judged she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in.
<p/>Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't much chance for anybody being alive in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). I pulled all around her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) and hollered a little, but there wasn't any answer; all dead still.
<p/>I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they could stand it I could.
<p/>Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker's remainders, because the captain would know her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooker</b></font>) uncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river.
<p/>It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.
<p/>By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people.
<p/>BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of seegars.
<p/>We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good time.
<p/>I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) didn't want no more adventures.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said that when I went in the texas and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) crawled back to get on the raft and found her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) nearly died, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) judged it was all up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
<p/>anyway it could be fixed; for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) didn't get saved he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would get drownded; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) did get saved, whoever saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would send him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) back home so as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) South, sure.
<p/>CHAPTER XIV. We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives. The seegars was prime. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was right
<p/>I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, `stead of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was interested.
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was most always right; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had an uncommon level head for a nigger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``I didn' know dey was so many un um.

<p/>WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after.
<p/>We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.
<p/>Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't anything but little saplings to tie to.
<p/>I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tore it out by the roots
<p/>'' I see it warn't no use wasting words--you can't learn a nigger to argue. So I quit. CHAPTER XV. and away she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went.
<p/>I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute
<p/>I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) back a stroke.
<p/>it seemed to me--and then there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) didn't come. I was in such a hurry I hadn't untied her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>I got up and tried to untie her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them.
<p/>That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead warn't sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.
<p/>I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time.
<p/>As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down the towhead. Thinks I whooped and listened.
<p/>Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again.
<p/>And the next time I was heading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t`other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.
<p/>I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me.
<p/>The next time it come I see I warn't heading for it, but heading away to the right of it. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop behind me.
<p/>I was tangled good now. That was somebody else's whoop, or else I was turned around. I throwed the paddle down.
<p/>I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and
<p/>not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't look natural nor sound natural in a fog.
<p/>The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.
<p/>I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.
<p/>In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I just give up then. I knowed what the matter was.
<p/>That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t`other side of it. It warn't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes.
<p/>It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.
<p/>I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don't ever think of that.
<p/>No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to yourself how fast you're going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag's tearing along.
<p/>If you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once--you'll see.
<p/>Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn't do it, and
<p/>directly I judged I'd got into a nest of towheads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I couldn't see I knowed was there because I'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks.
<p/>Well, I warn't long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern.
<p/>I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little faster than what I was.
<p/>Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.
<p/>You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>I was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother no more. I didn't want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy
<p/>But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern first.
<p/>First I didn't know where I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week.
<p/>It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as
<p/>I couldn't help it; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap. I could see by the stars. I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the water.
<p/>I took after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together.
<p/>When I got to it Jim was setting there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) head down between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knees, asleep, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) right arm hanging over the steering-oar.
<p/>Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft. The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt.
<p/>I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and began to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d had a rough time. Why didn't you stir me up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>'' Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain' dead--you ain'
<p/>drownded--you's back agin? It's too good for true, honey, it's too good for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o' you.
<p/>No, you ain' dead! you's back agin, `live en soun', jis de same ole Huck--de same ole Huck, thanks to goodness!
<p/>'' '' What's the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?'' <div class="bookquote">``Drinkin'? Has I ben a-drinkin'? Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, then, what makes you talk so wild? '' <div class="bookquote">``How does I talk wild?''

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I is, is I? Well, you answer me dis: Didn't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas' to de tow-head?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, I didn't. What tow-head? I hain't see no tow-head.'' <div class="bookquote">``You hain't seen no towhead? Looky here, didn't de line pull loose en

<p/>Well, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain't seen no fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.
<p/>I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same.
<p/>You couldn't a got drunk in that time, so of course you've been dreaming. '' <div class="bookquote">``Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Huck/Huck Creeps</b></font>)</div><p/>But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as--'' ``It don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't nothing in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any of it happen.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I know, because I've been here all the time.
<p/>'' Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying over it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, den , I reck'n
<p/>I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain't de powerfullest dream I ever see. En I hain't ever had no dream
<p/>b`fo' dat's tired me like dis one.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes.
<p/>So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it happened, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) painted it up considerable.
<p/>But this one was a staving dream; tell me all about it, Jim. '' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) must start in and ''`terpret'' it, because it was sent for a warning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but the current was another man that would get us away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn't try hard to make out to understand them
<p/>The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn't have no more trouble.
<p/>It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was clearing up again now.
<p/>Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,'' I says; <div class="bookquote">``but what does these things stand for?
<p/>they'd just take us into bad luck, `stead of keeping us out of it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.
<p/>You could see them first-rate now. Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had got the dream fixed so strong in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) did get the thing straightened around he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says: <div class="bookquote">``What do dey stan' for?
<p/>I`se gwyne to tell you. When I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos' broke bekase

<p/>Dat truck dah is trash ; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em ashamed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without saying anything but that. But that was enough.
<p/>It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry for it afterwards, neither.
<p/>It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) foot to get him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) to take it back. I didn't do him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) no more mean tricks, and I wouldn't done that one
<p/>WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.
<p/>if I'd a knowed it would make him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) feel that way. CHAPTER XVI. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) carried as many as thirty men, likely.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.
<p/>There was a power of style about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.
<p/>The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.
<p/>We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it.
<p/>I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?
<p/>But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again.
<p/>Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. That disturbed Jim--and me too. So the question was, what to do?
<p/>I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo.
<p/>Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited. There warn't nothing to do now
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d be mighty sure to see it, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d be a free man the minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) seen it, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) missed it he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.
<p/>but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it. Every little while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) jumps up and says: <div class="bookquote">``Dah she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But it warn't. It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) set down again, and went to watching, same as before.
<p/>Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), because I begun to get it through my head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was most free--and who was to blame for it?
<p/>Jim said it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Why, me . I couldn't get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way.
<p/>It got to troubling me so I couldn't rest ; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing.
<p/>I tried to make out to myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, every time,
<p/>But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. '' But you knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was running for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.
<p/>Conscience says to me, <div class="bookquote">``What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>That was so --I couldn't get around that noway. That was where it pinched. What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
<p/>Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried to learn you your book, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried to learn you your manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tried to be good to you every way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knowed how.
<p/>so mean? That's what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) done. '' I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.
<p/>I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still.
<p/>Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) danced around and says, <div class="bookquote">``Dah's Cairo! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it was Cairo
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was saying how the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would do when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got to a free State he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got enough he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would buy his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an Ab`litionist to go and steal them.
<p/>I reckoned I would die of miserableness. Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. It most froze me to hear such talk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wouldn't ever dared to talk such talk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) life before. Just see what a difference it made in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) the minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) judged he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was about free.
<p/>It was according to the old saying, <div class="bookquote">``Give a nigger an inch and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'ll take an ell. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking.
<p/>Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) would steal his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) children--children that belonged to a man I didn't even know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.
<p/>My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, <div class="bookquote">``Let up on me--it ain't too late yet--
<p/>I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). I'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself.
<p/>By and by one showed. Jim sings out: ``We's safe, Huck, we's safe! Jump up and crack yo' heels! Dat's de good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dat</b></font>) jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Dat</b></font>) old coat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dat</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I says: <div class="bookquote">``I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn't be, you know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'll say, it's all on accounts
<p/>o' Huck ; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it hadn' ben for Huck; Huck done it.
<p/>Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck; you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de only fren' ole Jim's got now.
<p/>I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>); but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.
<p/>I went along slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn't.
<p/>When I was fifty yards off, Jim says: <div class="bookquote">``Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) promise to ole Jim.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I got to do it-- I can't get out of it.
<p/>Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of them says: <div class="bookquote">``What's that yonder?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A piece of a raft,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says. '' Do you belong on it?'' '' Yes, sir.'' '' Any men on it?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>niggers</b></font>)</div>'' Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of the bend. Is your man white or black?
<p/>'' I didn't answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn't come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't man enough--
<p/>hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says: ``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s white.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, <div class="bookquote">``because it's pap that's there, and maybe you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s sick--and so is mam and Mary Ann. '' '' Oh, the devil!
<p/>we're in a hurry, boy. But I s`pose we've got to. Come, buckle to your paddle, and let's get along. ''
<p/>When we had made a stroke or two, I says: <div class="bookquote">``Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.
<p/>Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do it by myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. '' Well, that's infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what's the matter with your father?''
<p/>'' It's the--a--the--well, it ain't anything much. '' They stopped pulling. It warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft now.
<p/>One says: <div class="bookquote">``Boy, that's a lie. What is the matter with your pap? Answer up square now, and it'll be the better for you.
<p/>It's the--the--Gentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won't have to come a-near the raft--please do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will, sir, I will, honest--but don't leave us, please. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Set her (<font color='blue'><b>Gentlemen</b></font>) back, John, set her (<font color='blue'><b>Gentlemen</b></font>) back!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says one.
<p/>They backed water. '' Keep away, boy--keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us.
<p/>Your pap's got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. Why didn't you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?''
<p/>'' Well,'' says I, a-blubbering, <div class="bookquote">``I've told everybody before, and they just went away and left us.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poor devil, there's something in that.
<p/>We are right down sorry for you, but we--well, hang it, we don't want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I'll tell you what to do.
<p/>Don't you try to land by yourself, or you'll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.
<p/>It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever.
<p/>Don't be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we're trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us
<p/>, that's a good boy. It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is--it's only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s in pretty hard luck.
<p/>Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom!
<p/>it won't do to fool with small-pox, don't you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hold on, Parker,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the other man, <div class="bookquote">``here's a twenty to put on the board for me.
<p/>Good-bye, boy ; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you'll be all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' That's so, my boy-- good-bye, good-bye.
<p/>If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I;
<p/>They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>no use for me to try to learn to do right
<p/>; a body that don't get started right when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s little ain't got no show--when the pinch comes there ain't nothing to back him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) work, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gets beat.
<p/>Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s`pose you'd a done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?
<p/>what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?
<p/>No, says I, I'd feel bad--I'd feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says I, I was stuck.
<p/>So I reckoned I wouldn't bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time.
<p/>I couldn't answer that. I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. I looked all around; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) warn't anywhere. I says: <div class="bookquote">``Jim!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o' sight yit? Don't talk loud. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) was in the river under the stern oar, with just his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) nose out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho' if dey come aboard.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) they were out of sight, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) come aboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf' agin when dey was gone.
<p/>But lawsy, how you did fool 'em, Huck! Dat wuz de smartes' dodge! I tell you, chile, I`spec it save' ole Jim--
<p/>ole Jim ain't going to forgit you for dat, honey. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise--twenty dollars apiece.
<p/>Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wished we was already there. Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting. That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend.
<p/>I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.
<p/>I ranged up and says: <div class="bookquote">``Mister, is that town Cairo? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cairo? no. You must be a blame' fool. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>What town is it, mister?'' '' If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin' around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something you won't want.
<p/>'' I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.
<p/>We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn't go.
<p/>No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank.
<p/>I begun to suspicion something. So did Jim. I says: <div class="bookquote">``Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Doan' le's talk about it, Huck. Po' niggers can't have no luck. I awluz `spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn't done wid its work.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I'd never laid eyes on it.''  (<font color='red'><b>yo</b></font>)</div>'' It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know.
<p/>Don't you blame yo`self `bout it. '' When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!
<p/>So it was all up with Cairo. We talked it all over. It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't take the raft up the stream, of course.
<p/>So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!
<p/>There warn't no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. We didn't say a word for a good while.
<p/>There warn't anything to say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?
<p/>It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.
<p/>but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in.
<p/>By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no way We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't
<p/>anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us. So we shoved out after dark on the raft.
<p/>Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us.
<p/>The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more.
<p/>Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog. You can't tell the shape of the river, and you can't see no distance.
<p/>It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) would see it.
<p/>Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.
<p/>We could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) pounding along, but we didn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) good till she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) was close. She (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) aimed right for us.
<p/>Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>) head out and laughs, and thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>pilot</b></font>)'s mighty smart.
<p/>Well, here she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) comes, and we said she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) was going to try and shave us; but she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) was a big one, and she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us.
<p/>There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went overboard on one side
<p/>I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.
<p/>and I on the other, she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) come smashing straight through the raft. I could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half.
<p/>Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit.
<p/>Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) engines again ten seconds after she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>).
<p/>I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was <div class="bookquote">``treading water,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.
<p/>But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.
<p/>It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the bank.
<p/>I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.
<p/>I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.
<p/>CHAPTER XVII. IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head out, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Be done, boys!
<p/>Who's there? ''  (<font color='red'><b>a minute somebody</b></font>)</div>I says: <div class="bookquote">``It's me.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Who's me?'' <div class="bookquote">``George Jackson, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What do you want?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want nothing, sir.
<p/>I only want to go along by, but the dogs won't let me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?''
<p/>'' I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat. '' '' Oh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody.
<p/>What did you say your name was?'' <div class="bookquote">``George Jackson, sir. I'm only a boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraid--
<p/>nobody'll hurt you. But don't try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns.
<p/>George Jackson, is there anybody with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>No sir nobody</b></font>)</div>'' No, sir, nobody. '' I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.
<p/>The man sung out: <div class="bookquote">``Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain't you got any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door.
<p/>Bob, if you and Tom are ready, take your places. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All ready.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, sir; I never heard of them.'' '' Well, that may be so, and it mayn't. Now, all ready. Step forward, George Jackson.
<p/>And mind, don't you hurry--come mighty slow. If there's anybody with you, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) keep back--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) shows himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>)'ll be shot.
<p/>Come along now. Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to squeeze in, d' you hear? '' I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to.
<p/>I took one slow step at a time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.
<p/>The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting.
<p/>I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said, <div class="bookquote">``There, that's enough--put your head in.
<p/>The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me at them, for about a quarter of a minute:
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>I done it, but I judged they would take it off. Three big men with guns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you;
<p/>the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and handsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) two young women which I couldn't see right well.
<p/>As soon as I was in the old gentleman he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) locked the door and barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows--there warn't none on the side.
<p/>They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, <div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ain't a Shepherdson--no, there ain't any Shepherdson about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the old man said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped I wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't mean no harm by it--it was only to make sure.
<p/>The old gentleman says: <div class="bookquote">``There; I reckon it's all right. Come in. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) didn't pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands, and said it was all right.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old lady says: ``Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he (<font color='blue'><b>Saul</b></font>) can be; and don't you reckon it may be he (<font color='blue'><b>Saul</b></font>)'s hungry?
<p/>So the old lady says: <div class="bookquote">``Betsy''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this was a nigger woman-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``you fly around and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Saul</b></font>) something to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)--oh, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) is himself.
<p/>Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) and dress him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) up in some of yours that's dry.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>this a woman thing</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True for you, Rachel--I forgot. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Buck</b></font>)</div>'' Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was a little bigger than me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) came in gaping and digging one fist into his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was dragging a gun along with the other one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) hadn't on anything but a shirt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was very frowzy-headed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.
<p/>'' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got one. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They all laughed, and Bob says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow in coming.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bob</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Buck, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the old man, <div class="bookquote">``you'll have show enough, all in good time, don't you fret about that.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always kept down; I don't get no show. '' Go `long with you now, and do as your mother told you.
<p/>When we got up-stairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I put them on.
<p/>While I was at it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked me where Moses was when the candle went out.
<p/>'' I said I didn't know ; I hadn't heard about it before, no way. '' Well, guess,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) says. ''
<p/>How'm I going to guess,'' says I, <div class="bookquote">``when I never heard tell of it before?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But you can guess, can't you?
<p/>It's just as easy. '' '' Which candle? '' I says. '' Why, any candle,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) says. '' I don't know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) was,'' says I; <div class="bookquote">``where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) was in the dark !

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? Say, how long are you going to stay here? You got to stay always.

<p/>Confound these ole britches! I reckon I'd better put 'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm. Are you all ready?
<p/>All right. Come along, old hoss. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk --that is what they had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've come across yet.
<p/>Buck and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.
<p/>They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs.
<p/>They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and
<p/>nobody but just me and pap left, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) troubles; so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) died I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn't So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it.
<p/>Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was.
<p/>So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says: <div class="bookquote">``Can you spell, Buck?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) says. '' I bet you can't spell my name,'' says I. <div class="bookquote">``I bet you what you dare I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>).
<p/>'' All right,'' says I, <div class="bookquote">``go ahead.''

'' Well,'' says I, <div class="bookquote">``you done it, but I didn't think you could.
<p/>I set it down, private, because somebody might want me to spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it.
<p/>It ain't no slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.
<p/>It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in town.
<p/>There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them.
<p/>There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town.
<p/>I hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log.
<p/>There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it.
<p/>It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) up and got her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in good shape, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got tuckered out.
<p/>Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.
<p/>By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested.
<p/>They wouldn't took any money for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things.
<p/>On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.
<p/>This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.
<p/>It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.
<p/>One was a big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a man that left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, it didn't say why.
<p/>I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry.
<p/>Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead.
<p/>And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.
<p/>They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called <div class="bookquote">``Signing the Declaration.
<p/>There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own self when she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was only fifteen years old.
<p/>There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Highland Marys</b></font>)</div>They was different from any pictures I ever see before--blacker, mostly, than is common.
<p/>One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other hand hanging down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said ``Shall
<p/>all combed up straight to the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said ``I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.
<p/>There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheeks; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mouth, and underneath the picture it said <div class="bookquote">``And Art
<p/>I Never See Thee More Alas. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Another one was a young lady with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair '' Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.
<p/>These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods.
<p/>Everybody was sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) died, because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had done what they had lost.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was at work on what they said was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) greatest picture when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took sick, and every day and every night it was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prayer to be allowed to live till she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) got it done, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never got the chance.
<p/>It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair all down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had two arms folded across her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room, and every time her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) birthday come they hung flowers on it.
<p/>'' But I reckoned that with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) disposition she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was having a better time in the graveyard. Other times it was hid with a little curtain.
<p/>The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look too spidery, seemed to me.
<p/>This young girl kept a scrap-book when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own head.
<p/>This is what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded: ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D And did young Stephen sicken, And did young Stephen die?
<p/>No; such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad hearts round him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) thickened, 'Twas not from sickness' shots.
<p/>No whooping-cough did rack his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) frame, Nor measles drear with spots; Not these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots.
<p/>It was very good poetry. And did the sad hearts thicken, And did the mourners cry? Despised love struck not with woe
<p/>That head of curly knots, Nor stomach troubles laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) low, Young Stephen Dowling Bots. O no. Then list with tearful eye, Whilst I his (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) fate do tell.
<p/>They got him (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) out and emptied him (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>); Alas it was too late; His (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) spirit was gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great.
<p/>If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) was fourteen, there ain't no telling what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) could a done by and by.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) soul did from this cold world fly By falling down a well. Buck said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) could rattle off poetry like nothing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) would slap down a line, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) didn't ever have to stop to think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) warn't particular ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) could write about anything you choose to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bots</b></font>) to write about just so it was sadful.
<p/>Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be on hand with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``tribute''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was cold.
<p/>The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was Whistler.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) called them tributes. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) warn't ever the same after that; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never complained, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kinder pined away and did not live long.
<p/>Poor thing, many's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) poor old scrap-book and read in it when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pictures had been aggravating me
<p/>and I had soured on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between us.
<p/>Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
<p/>now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow.
<p/>They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked to have them when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was alive, and nobody ever slept there.
<p/>The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sewed there a good deal and read her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Bible there mostly.
<p/>Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.
<p/>There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing <div class="bookquote">``The Last Link is Broken''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>and play <div class="bookquote">``The Battle of Prague''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>on it.
<p/>The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside.
<p/>It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place.
<p/>Nothing couldn't be better. And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too! CHAPTER XVIII. COL. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was well born, as the saying is, and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) always said it, too, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself.
<p/>Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) was clean shaved every morning all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) thin face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) was a gentleman all over; and so was his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) family. His (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) forehead was high, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) hair was black and straight and hung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) hands was long and thin, and every day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen
<p/>so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn't no frivolishness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>), not a bit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) warn't ever loud.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) smiled, and it was good to see; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) was as kind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) could be --you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered where he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) was.
<p/>Everybody loved to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) around, too; he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) was sunshine most always-- I mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) made it seem like good weather.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.
<p/>When him (<font color='blue'><b>Douglas</b></font>) and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again till they had set down.
<p/>Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) held it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and then they bowed and said, <div class="bookquote">``Our duty to you, sir, and madam;''  (<font color='red'><b>Bob</b></font>)</div>and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and
<p/>Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.
<p/>Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.
<p/>Then there was Miss Charlotte; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could be when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) warn't stirred up; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father.
<p/>They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was beautiful.
<p/>So was her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) was only twenty.
<p/>My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.
<p/>This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.
<p/>Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too. The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.
<p/>Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights.
<p/>These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.
<p/>There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.
<p/>The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses.
<p/>One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse coming. We was crossing the road.
<p/>Buck says: <div class="bookquote">``Quick! Jump for the woods! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Buck/Buck Harkness</b></font>)</div>We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse easy and looking like a soldier.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gun across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pommel. I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) grabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we didn't wait. We started through the woods on a run.
<p/>, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) gun; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) rode away the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) come--to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see.
<p/>The old gentleman's eyes blazed a minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face sort of smoothed down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) says, kind of gentle: <div class="bookquote">``I don't like that shooting from behind a bush.
<p/>The woods warn't thick We never stopped running till we got home. Why didn't you step into the road, my boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Charlotte she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head up like a queen while Buck was telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) tale, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) nostrils spread and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes snapped.
<p/>'' The Shepherdsons don't, father. They always take advantage. '' The two young men looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) turned pale, but the color come back when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) found the man warn't hurt.
<p/>Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves, I says: <div class="bookquote">``Did you want to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), Buck?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, I bet I did. '' '' What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) do to you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) never done nothing to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, then, what did you want to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) for?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, nothing--only it's on account of the feud. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>What's a feud?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, where was you raised? Don't you know what a feud is?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never heard of it before--tell me about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Buck/Buck Harkness</b></font>)</div><p/>Well,'' says Buck, <div class="bookquote">``a feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with another man, and kills him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>); then that other man's brother kills him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the cousins chip in--and by and by
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Buck/Buck Harkness</b></font>)</div>everybody's killed off, and there ain't no more feud. But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time.'' <div class="bookquote">``Has this one been going on long, Buck?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was trouble `bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and
<p/>'' Well, I should reckon ! It started thirty year ago, or som`ers along there. so he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) up and shot the man that won the suit--which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would naturally do, of course.
<p/>Anybody would. '' '' What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?'' <div class="bookquote">``I reckon maybe--I don't know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, who done the shooting?

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they don't know now what the row was about in the first place.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Has there been many killed, Buck?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don't always kill. Pa's got a few buckshot in him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) don't mind it
<p/>`cuz he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) don't weigh much, anyway. Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom's been hurt once or twice.''
<p/>Bout three months ago my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t`other side of the river, and didn't have no weapon with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>), which was blame' foolishness, and in a lonesome place he (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>) hears a horse a-coming behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>), and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>) gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>) hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>) white hair a-flying in the wind; and `stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud `lowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>) could out-run him (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>); so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bud</b></font>) stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rode up and shot him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes; we got one and they got one. ' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) didn't git much chance to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) luck, for inside of a week our folks laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) out.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) warn't a coward. Not by a blame' sight.
<p/>Why, that old man kep' up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner.
<p/>They was all a-horseback; he (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) lit off of his (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep' his (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) horse before him (<font color='blue'><b>winner</b></font>) to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peppered away at them.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be fetched home--and one of 'em was dead, and another died the next day.
<p/>No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowards he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz they don't breed any of that kind .
<p/>There ain't a coward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one. And there ain't no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either. ''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody a-horseback.
<p/>The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.
<p/>It was pretty ornery preaching--all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest
<p/>The Shepherdsons done the same. Sundays I had run across yet. About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.
<p/>Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.
<p/>I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) door, which was next to ours, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) took me in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and
<p/>I said I did; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) asked me if I would do something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) and not tell anybody, and I said I would.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>)'d forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), and not say nothing to nobody.
<p/>I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there
<p/>warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it's cool. If you notice, most folks don't go to church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.
<p/>Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament.
<p/>So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with <div class="bookquote">``HALF-PAST TWO''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>wrote on it with a pencil.
<p/>I couldn't make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pulled me in and shut the door; then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked in the Testament till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) found the paper, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) read it she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked glad; and before a body could think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes lighted up, and it made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) powerful pretty.
<p/>I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) what the paper was about, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked me if I had read it, and
<p/>I said no, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked me if I could read writing, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``no, only coarse-hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said the paper warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) place, and I might go and play now.
<p/>I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.
<p/>When we was out of sight of the house he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) looked back and around a second, and then comes a-running, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a whole stack o' water-moccasins.
<p/>I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else. and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) door waiting for me. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said that yesterday. He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) oughter know a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them.
<p/>I followed a half a mile; then he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) struck out over the swamp, and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile.
<p/>We come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) says: ``You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's whah dey is.
<p/>What is he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) up to, anyway? So I says: <div class="bookquote">``All right; trot ahead. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k`yer to see 'em no mo'.
<p/>'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>). I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom
<p/>I waked him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) to see me again, but
<p/>all hung around with vines, and found a man laying there asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim! it warn't.
<p/>Said he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) swum along behind me that night, and heard me yell every time, but dasn't answer, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) didn't want nobody to pick him (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) up and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) into slavery again.
<p/>Says he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las'; when you landed

<p/>Just the same outside. Thinks I, what does it mean? Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says: <div class="bookquote">``What's it all about?

<p/>un 'm dah , I reck`n, en you bet you he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)'ll fetch one ef he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) gits a chanst. '' I took up the river road as hard as I could put.
<p/>When I come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.
<p/>There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier
<p/>There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn't come it.
<p/>By and by I begin to hear guns a good ways off. I didn't. Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) got shot at.
<p/>The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch both ways. By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.
<p/>They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) saddle.
<p/>All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run.
<p/>They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them.
<p/>They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.
<p/>One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old. The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.
<p/>As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) didn't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) told me to watch out sharp and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was awful surprised. --wouldn't be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn't come down.
<p/>Buck begun to cry and rip, and `lowed that him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) cousin Joe -LRB-that was the other young chap-RRB- would make up for this day yet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) two brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush.
<p/>Buck said his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) father and brothers ought to waited for their relations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.
<p/>I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) didn't manage to kill Harney that day he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) shot at him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)--I hain't ever heard anything like it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) said they'd got across the river and was safe. All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses!
<p/>The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, <div class="bookquote">``Kill them, kill them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the the men</b></font>)</div><p/>It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain't a-going to tell all that happened--it would make me sick again if I was to do that.
<p/>I wished I hadn't ever come ashore that night to see such things. I ain't ever going to get shut of them--
<p/>lots of times I dream about them. I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
<p/>Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on.
<p/>I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow.
<p/>I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) father about that paper and the curious way she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) acted, and then maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would a locked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) up, and this awful mess wouldn't ever happened.
<p/>When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could.
<p/>I cried a little when I was covering up Buck's face, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was mighty good to me. It was just dark now.
<p/>Jim warn't on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.
<p/>I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp. The raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared!
<p/>I couldn't get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me says: <div class="bookquote">``Good lan'!
<p/>is dat you, honey? Doan' make no noise. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It was Jim's voice--nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) grabbed me and hugged me
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was so glad to see me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: ``Laws bless you, chile, I `uz right down sho' you's dead agin.
<p/>; so I's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er de crick, so's to be all ready for to shove out
<p/>Jack's been heah; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) say he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) reck'n you's ben shot, kase you didn' come home no mo' en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead.
<p/>I says: <div class="bookquote">``All right--that's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll think I've been killed, and floated down the river--there's something up there that 'll help them think so--
<p/>so don't you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.
<p/>Lawsy, I's mighty glad to git you back again, honey. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi.
<p/>I hadn't had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens
<p/>--there ain't nothing in the world so good when it's cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time.
<p/>Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp.
<p/>We said there warn't no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't.
<p/>You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft. CHAPTER XIX. TWO or three days and nights went by
<p/>; I reckon I might say they swum by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put in the time.
<p/>It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone
<p/>we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them.
<p/>Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come.
<p/>Then we set out the lines. Not a sound anywheres--perfectly still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe.
<p/>The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t`other side; you couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t`other side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!
<p/>A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.
<p/>And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by lazy off to sleep.
<p/>Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the other side you couldn't tell nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) only whether she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.
<p/>Next you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the axe flash and come down
<p/>--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the k`chunk !
<p/>--it had took all that time to come over the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.
<p/>Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.
<p/>A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.
<p/>Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) out to about the middle we let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) alone, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) float wherever the current wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on clothes, nohow.
<p/>Jim said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) believed it was spirits; but I says: <div class="bookquote">``No; spirits wouldn't say, `Dern the dern fog.' ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time.
<p/>Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.
<p/>We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.
<p/>Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to make so many.
<p/>Jim said the moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many,
<p/>It's lovely to live on a raft. so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down.
<p/>Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would turn a corner and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lights would wink out and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) waves would get to us, a long time after she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.
<p/>Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest. After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours the shores was black--
<p/>These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.
<p/>One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some berries.
<p/>Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it.
<p/>no more sparks in the cabin windows. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was me
<p/>I was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doing nothing, and was being chased for it--
<p/>--or maybe Jim. said there was men and dogs a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says: <div class="bookquote">``Don't you do it.
<p/>I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in--
<p/>I lit out for our towhead, and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off, shouting.
<p/>We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe.
<p/>that'll throw the dogs off the scent. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>They done it, and soon as they was aboard One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head and very gray whiskers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) only had one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.
<p/>After breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didn't know one another.
<p/>The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. '' What got you into trouble?'' says the baldhead to t`other chap.
<p/>Well, I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off.
<p/>'' So I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out with you. That's the whole yarn-- what's yourn?
<p/>Well, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revival thar `bout a week, and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin' it mighty warm for the rummies, I tell you, and takin' as much as five or six dollars a night--ten cents a head, children and niggers free--and business a-growin' all the time, when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I had a way of puttin' in my time with a private jug on the sly.
<p/>A nigger rousted me out this mornin', and told me the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and they'd be along pretty soon and give me `bout half an hour's start, and then run me down if they could; and if they got me
<p/>'' they'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. I didn't wait for no breakfast-- I warn't hungry.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young one, <div class="bookquote">``I reckon we might double-team it together; what do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What 're you alassin' about?'' says the bald-head. '' To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded down into such company.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) begun to wipe the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) eye with a rag. '' Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?'' says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.
<p/>Yes, it is good enough for me; it's as good as I deserve; for who fetched me so low when I was so high?
<p/>'' I did myself. I don't blame you , gentlemen--far from it; I don't blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there's a grave somewhere for me.
<p/>The world may go on just as it's always done, and take everything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can't take that.
<p/>Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went on a-wiping. '' Drot your pore broken heart,'' says the baldhead; <div class="bookquote">``what are you heaving your pore broken heart at us f`r?
<p/>we hain't done nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, I know you haven't. I ain't blaming you, gentlemen. I brought myself down--yes, I did it myself.
<p/>It's right I should suffer-- perfectly right --I don't make any moan.'' <div class="bookquote">``Brought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--'tis no matter. The secret of my birth-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The secret of your birth!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>says the young man, very solemn, <div class="bookquote">``I will reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you.
<p/>Do you mean to say-- By rights I am a duke! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Jim's eyes bugged out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.
<p/>My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own father dying about the same time.
<p/>Then the baldhead says: <div class="bookquote">``No! you can't mean it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored.
<p/>I am the lineal descendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!''
<p/>We tried to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) said it warn't much use, he (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) couldn't be much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>), that would do him (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) would tell us how.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) said we ought to bow when we spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>), and say <div class="bookquote">``Your Grace,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``My Lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Your Lordship'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wouldn't mind it if we called him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) plain <div class="bookquote">``Bridgewater,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) at dinner, and do any little thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wanted done.
<p/>All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and says, <div class="bookquote">``Will yo' Grace have some o' dis or some o' dat?
<p/>Jim pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ever so much, and so did I. Well, that was all easy, so we done it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>--didn't have much to say, and didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke.
<p/>So, along in the afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Looky here, Bilgewater,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``I'm nation sorry for you, but you ain't the only person that's had troubles like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But the old man got pretty silent by and by He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to have something on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind. <div class="bookquote">``No?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No you ain't.
<p/>You ain't the only person that's ben snaked down wrongfully out'n a high place.'' <div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>'' No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) birth.
<p/>'' And, by jings, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begins to cry. '' Hold! What do you mean?'' '' Bilgewater, kin I trust you?'' says the old man, still sort of sobbing.
<p/>'' To the bitter death! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the old man by the hand and squeezed it, and says, <div class="bookquote">``That secret of your being: speak!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin! '' You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then the duke says: <div class="bookquote">``You are what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``You! At your age! No! You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.
<p/>Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud
<p/>we'd got him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) with us, too. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) .
<p/>could do him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) any good; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said it often made him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) feel easier and better for a while if people treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and always called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Your Majesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and waited on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) first at meals, and didn't set down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) presence till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) asked them.
<p/>So Jim and me set to majestying him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and doing this and that and t`other for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and standing up till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) told us we might set down.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all This done him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) heaps of good, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got cheerful and comfortable.
<p/>But the duke kind of soured on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and said the duke's great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) father, and was allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the king says: <div class="bookquote">``Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o'
<p/>your bein' sour? It 'll only make things oncomfortable. It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke, it ain't your fault
<p/>you warn't born a king-- so what's the use to worry? Make the best o' things the way you find 'em, says I--that's my motto.
<p/>This ain't no bad thing that we've struck here--plenty grub and an easy life--come, give us your hand, duke, and le's all
<p/>It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.
<p/>be friends. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't
<p/>But I never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way; then you don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble.
<p/>If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, `long as it would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim,
<p/>If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) kind of people is to let them have their own way.
<p/>THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running--was Jim a runaway nigger?
<p/>no kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. so I didn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). CHAPTER XX. Says I: <div class="bookquote">``Goodness sakes!
<p/>would a runaway nigger run south ? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>No, they allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) wouldn't. I had to account for things some way, so
<p/>I says: ``My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and they all died off but
<p/>Pa, he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) `lowed he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.
<p/>Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'d squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.
<p/>me and pa and my brother Ike. That warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.
<p/>Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ike</b></font>) ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.
<p/>Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up no more.
<p/>Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was a runaway nigger.
<p/>The duke says: <div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to.
<p/>We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't bother us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div>I'll think the thing over--I'll invent a plan that'll fix it.
<p/>We'll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to go by that town yonder in daylight--it mightn't be healthy.
<p/>Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that.
<p/>My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's, which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up.
<p/>'' So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like. Well, the duke allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would take my bed; but the king allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wouldn't.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on.
<p/>Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke says: '' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression.
<p/>Your Grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself. '' Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I submit; 'tis my fate.
<p/>I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear it. '' We got away as soon as it was good and dark.
<p/>The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town.
<p/>We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by-- that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right.
<p/>it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.
<p/>It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed, because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight.
<p/>When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock My souls, how the wind did scream along!
<p/>And every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum! bum!
<p/>bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind.
<p/>We didn't have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) head this way or that and miss them.
<p/>I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would stand the first half of it for me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was always mighty good that way,
<p/>Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't
<p/>; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn't running so high now.
<p/>About two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mind, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard.
<p/>I took the watch, and Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) laid down and snored away; and by and by the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day.
<p/>The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.
<p/>no show for me It most killed Jim a-laughing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway. Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would <div class="bookquote">``lay out a campaign,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as they called it.
<p/>The duke went down into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud.
<p/>One bill said, <div class="bookquote">``The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>would <div class="bookquote">``lecture on the Science of Phrenology''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>at such and such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and <div class="bookquote">``furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div>The duke said that was him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) . In another bill he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was the ``world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London.
<p/>In other bills he (<font color='blue'><b>Drury</b></font>) had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a <div class="bookquote">``divining-rod,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``dissipating witch spells,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and so on.
<p/>'' By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Drury</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``But the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the boards, Royalty?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>The first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.
<p/>No,'' says the king. '' You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen Grandeur,'' says the duke. '' How does that strike you?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you see, I don't know nothing about play-actin', and hain't ever seen much of it.
<p/>I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace. Do you reckon you can learn me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Easy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/>So the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.
<p/>But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>), maybe.''
<p/>'' All right. I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway. Le's commence right away. '' '' '' No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.
<p/>Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) goes to bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)'s got on her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) night-gown and her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) ruffled nightcap.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) said was meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t`other chap, and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.
<p/>The king was satisfied; so the duke got out his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same time, to show how it had got to be done; then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) give the book to the king and told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to get his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) part by heart.
<p/>There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and after dinner the duke said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had ciphered out his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would go down to the town and fix that thing.
<p/>Here are the costumes for the parts. '' The king allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would go, too, and see if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) couldn't strike something.
<p/>We was out of coffee, so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some. When we got there there
<p/>We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said everybody that warn't too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the woods.
<p/>The king got the directions, and allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.
<p/>warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. The duke said what he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was after was a printing-office.
<p/>We found it; a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.
<p/>It was a dirty, littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.
<p/>The duke shed his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) coat and said he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) was all right now. So me and the king lit out for the camp-meeting.
<p/>We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around.
<p/>The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the flies.
<p/>There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.
<p/>The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs.
<p/>The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger and held crowds of people. They didn't have no backs.
<p/>The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico.
<p/>Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt.
<p/>The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks was courting on the sly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them
<p/>and they done it in such a rousing way; then he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) lined out two more for them to sing--and so on.
<p/>The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout.
<p/>Then the preacher begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the platform
<p/>The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front of it, with
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) arms and his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) body going all the time, and shouting his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) words out with all his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) might; and every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) would hold up his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting, <div class="bookquote">``It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!
<p/>Look upon it and live!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And people would shout out, <div class="bookquote">``Glory!--A-a- men !''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! -LRB- Amen !-RRB- come, sick and sore! -LRB- Amen !-RRB- come, lame and halt and blind!
<p/>-LRB- Amen !-RRB- come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! -LRB- A-A-Men !-RRB- come, all that's worn and soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit!
<p/>come with a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>-LRB- A-A-Men ! Glory, Glory Hallelujah! -RRB- And so on. You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on account of the shouting and crying.
<p/>Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.
<p/>Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) over everybody; and next he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) went a-charging up on to the platform, and the preacher he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) to speak to the people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) done it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) told them he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>)'d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) was glad of it
<p/>; it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) was a changed man now, and happy for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) life; and, poor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) was going to start right off and work his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) a long time to get there without money, he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) would get there anyway, and every time he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) convinced a pirate he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Don't you thank me, don't you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody sings out, <div class="bookquote">``Take up a collection for him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>), take up a collection!''
 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) pass the hat around!''
 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>So the king went all through the crowd with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hat swabbing his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) let them kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) for to remember him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) by; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) always done it; and some of them he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hugged and kissed as many as five or six times--and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to live in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) couldn't do no good, and besides he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates.
<p/>When we got back to the raft and he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) come to count up he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) found under a wagon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) was starting home through the woods.
<p/>Then everybody said it, the preacher too. The king said, take it all around, it laid over any day he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d ever put in in the missionarying line.
<p/>The duke was thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d been doing pretty well till the king come to show up, but after that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) didn't think so so much.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so they done it.
<p/>The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) set up a little piece of poetry, which he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) made, himself, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with. he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it.
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) took in nine dollars and a half, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d done a pretty square day's work for it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) showed us another little job he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d printed and hadn't charged for, because it was for us.
<p/>It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) shoulder, and <div class="bookquote">``$200 reward''  (<font color='red'><b>a nigger</b></font>)</div>under it.
<p/>It said he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) and send him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) back
<p/>The reading was all about Jim, and just described him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to a dot. he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could have the reward and expenses. ''
<p/>Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward.
<p/>Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor.
<p/>Now,'' says the duke, ``after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.
<p/>We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could boom right along if we wanted to.
<p/>We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.
<p/>When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis trip?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no trouble about running daytimes. '' No,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``I reckon not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well,'' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``dat's all right, den. I doan' mine one er two kings, but dat's enough. Dis one's powerful drunk, en de duke ain' much better.
<p/>I found Jim had been trying to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to talk French, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could hear what it was like; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had been in this country so long, and had so much trouble, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d forgot it.
<p/>The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal.
<p/>After breakfast the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) took a seat on the corner of the raft, and pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) boots and rolled up his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) britches, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) legs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) pipe, and went to getting his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) Romeo and Juliet by heart.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXI. IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn't tie up. When he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had got it pretty good him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and the duke begun to practice it together.
<p/>The duke had to learn him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) over and over again how to say every speech; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sigh, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heart, and after a while he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) done it pretty well; <div class="bookquote">``only,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) says, ``you mustn't bellow out Romeo !
<p/>that way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy, so-- R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you know, and
<p/>Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see.
<p/>But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river.
<p/>After dinner the duke says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so I guess we'll add a little more to it.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Capet</b></font>) doesn't bray like a jackass. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>We want a little something to answer encores with, anyway.'' '' What's onkores, Bilgewater?
<p/>The duke told him (<font color='blue'><b>jackass</b></font>), and then says: <div class="bookquote">``I'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe; and you--well, let me see--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>oh, I've got it--you can do Hamlet's soliloquy.'' '' Hamlet's which?'' <div class="bookquote">``Hamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.
<p/>Ah, it's sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. I haven't got it in the book--I've only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out from memory.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible every now and then; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) would hoist up his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) eyebrows; next he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) would squeeze his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) would sigh, and next he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)'d let on to drop a tear.
<p/>I'll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it back from recollection's vaults. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It was beautiful to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) arms stretched away up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) head tilted back, looking up at the sky; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) begins to rip and rave and grit his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) teeth; and after that, all through his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) howled, and spread around, and swelled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.
<p/>This is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) was learning it to the king: To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep, Great nature's second course, And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.
<p/>By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) got it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) told us to give attention. There's the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking!
<p/>I would thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The law's delay, and
<p/>In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns, Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat
<p/>And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops, With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. '
<p/>the quietus which his (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) pangs might take. i' the adage , Is sicklied o'er with care. Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.
<p/>Well, the old man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked that speech, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mighty soon got it so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do it first rate.
<p/>It seemed like he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was just born for it; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would rip and tear and rair up behind when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was getting it off.
<p/>The first chance we got, the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some show bills printed; and after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a most uncommon lively place, for there warn't nothing but sword-fighting and rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time.
<p/>One morning, when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us
<p/>but Jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show.
<p/>We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses.
<p/>But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery--go! The circus would leave before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance.
<p/>The duke he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) hired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They read like this: Shaksperean Revival!!!
<p/>The world renowned tragedians, David Garrick the younger, of Drury Lane Theatre, London, and Edmund Kean the elder, of the Royal Haymarket Theatre, Whitechapel, Pudding Lane, Piccadilly, London, and the Royal Continental Theatres, in their sublime Shaksperean Spectacle entitled The Balcony Scene in Romeo and Juliet!!!

<p/>The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed.
<p/>The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware.
<p/>The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn't generly have but one hinge--a leather one.
<p/>Some of the fences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus's time, like enough.
<p/>Admission 25 cents; children and servants, 10 cents. Then we went loafing around the town. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.
<p/>All the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.
<p/>There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery lot.
<p/>They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words.
<p/>There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) most always had his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) britches-pockets, except when he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch.
<p/>What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was: <div class="bookquote">``Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left.
<p/>Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own.
<p/>Ask Bill.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Maybe Bill he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) a chaw; maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) lies and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) ain't got none. They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, <div class="bookquote">``I wisht you'd len'
<p/>a lie pretty much everytime; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no stranger, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) says: ''  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>You give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) a chaw, did you?

<p/>You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me, Lafe Buckner , then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and won't charge you no back intrust, nuther.''
<p/>'' Well, I did pay you back some of it wunst. '' '' Yes, you did--`bout six chaws. You borry'd store tobacker and paid back nigger-head.
<p/>When they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it's handed back, and says, sarcastic: <div class="bookquote">``Here, gimme the chaw , and you take the plug .
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>these fellows</b></font>)</div>Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. '' All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else
<p/>but mud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in all the places.
<p/>You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>)'d stretch out and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>) eyes and wave her (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>) ears whilst the pigs was milking her (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>), and look as happy as if she (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>) was on salary.
<p/>The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out, <div class="bookquote">``Hi! so boy! sick him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), Tige!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a loafer</b></font>)</div><p/>and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise.
<p/>There couldn't anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), or tying a tin pan to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tail and see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) run himself to death.
<p/>On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in.
<p/>Then they'd settle back again till there was a dog fight. The people had moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over.
<p/>People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time.
<p/>Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer.
<p/>Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.
<p/>The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.
<p/>Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them in the wagons. There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I seen three fights.
<p/>By and by somebody sings out: <div class="bookquote">``Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) little old monthly drunk; here he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) comes, boys!''
 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs. One of them says: <div class="bookquote">``Wonder who he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>)'s a-gwyne to chaw up this time.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>)'d a-chawed up all the men he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>)'s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>)'d have considerable ruputation now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another one says, <div class="bookquote">``I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, `cuz then I'd know I warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Boggs</b></font>)</div>Boggs comes a-tearing along on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) horse, whooping and yelling like an Injun, and singing out: ``Cler the track, thar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) was drunk, and weaving about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) saddle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) was over fifty year old, and had a very red face.
<p/>Everybody yelled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) and laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) and sassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) sassed back, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>)'d attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) couldn't wait now because he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>)'d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) motto was, <div class="bookquote">``Meat first, and spoon vittles to top off on.

<p/>You prepared to die? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rode on.

<p/>Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) head down so he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>)'s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled.

<p/>By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a heap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come.
<p/>You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says to Boggs, mighty ca'm and slow--he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock.
<p/>If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you.
<p/>Till one o'clock, mind--no longer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody stirred, and there warn't no more laughing.
<p/>Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) could yell, all down the street; and pretty soon back he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up.
<p/>Some men crowded around him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) and tried to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) to shut up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) wouldn't; they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) must go home
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) cussed away with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) might, and throwed his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) went a-raging down the street again, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) gray hair a-flying.
<p/>Everybody that could get a chance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) tried their best to coax him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) off of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) horse so they could lock him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) up and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) sober; but it warn't no use--up the street he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.
<p/>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) must go right away. But it didn't do no good. By and by somebody says: <div class="bookquote">``Go for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) daughter!--quick, go for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) daughter; sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>)'ll listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>If anybody can persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) can. ''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>So somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways and stopped.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a-holt of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arms and hurrying him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) along.
<p/>In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) warn't hanging back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky.
<p/>Somebody sings out: <div class="bookquote">``Boggs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Somebody</b></font>)</div>I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn. The same second I see a young girl coming on the run, and two men with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>), and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level--both barrels cocked.
<p/>Bang! goes the first shot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) staggers back, clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) tumbles backwards on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) arms spread out.
<p/>That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throws herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, crying, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>The crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting, ``Back, back!
<p/>Boggs throws up both of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) hands and says, <div class="bookquote">``O Lord, don't shoot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boggs</b></font>)</div>give him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) air, give him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) air! '' Colonel Sherburn he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) pistol on to the ground, and turned around on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) heels and walked off.
<p/>They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at the window, where I was close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) and could see in.
<p/>They laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) on the floor and put one large Bible under his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) head, and opened another one and spread it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) breast; but they tore open his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) shirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) made about a dozen long gasps, his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) breast lifting the Bible up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) drawed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) breath, and letting it down again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) breathed it out--and after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) laid still; he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) was dead.
<p/>Then they pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) daughter away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>), screaming and crying, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) off. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.
<p/>Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was saying all the time, <div class="bookquote">``Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows; '
<p/>tain't right and `tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>folks</b></font>)</div>There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there was going to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was excited.
<p/>Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening.
<p/>One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) around from one place to t`other and watching everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) mark the places on the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) cane; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) hat-brim down over his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) eyes, and sung out, <div class="bookquote">``Boggs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sherburn</b></font>)</div>and then fetched his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) cane down slow to a level, and says <div class="bookquote">``Bang!
<p/>The people that had seen the thing said he (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all happened.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sherburn</b></font>)</div>staggered backwards, says <div class="bookquote">``Bang!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>again, and fell down flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>) back. Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Boggs</b></font>).
<p/>In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.
<p/>THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see.
<p/>Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach.
<p/>Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. CHAPTER XXII. Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared most to death.
<p/>They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise.
<p/>Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she (<font color='blue'><b>Sherburn</b></font>) goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.
<p/>Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sherburn</b></font>) little front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sherburn</b></font>) hand, and takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Sherburn</b></font>) stand, perfectly ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word.
<p/>It was a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out <div class="bookquote">``Tear down the fence! tear down the fence!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.
<p/>Sherburn run his (<font color='blue'><b>Sherburn</b></font>) eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him (<font color='blue'><b>Sherburn</b></font>), but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky.
<p/>Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got sand in it.
<p/>Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down. The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sherburn</b></font>) says, slow and scornful:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The idea of you lynching anybody! It's amusing. The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man !
<p/>Because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man ?
<p/>Why, a man's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as long as it's daytime and you're not behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I was born and raised in the South, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average all around.
<p/>In the North he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lets anybody walk over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.
<p/>In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot.
<p/>Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people--whereas you're just as brave, and no braver.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Do I know you? I know you clear through. The average man's a coward. Why don't your juries hang murderers?
<p/>Because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark--and it's just what they would do.
<p/>So they always acquit; and then a man goes in the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back and lynches the rascal.
<p/>Your mistake is, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks.
<p/>'' You brought part of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn't had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to start you, you'd a taken it out in blowing.
<p/>'' You didn't want to come. The average man don't like trouble and danger. You don't like trouble and danger. But if only half a man--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts `Lynch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!
<p/>so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man's coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you're going to do.
<p/>The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is--a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers.
<p/>lynch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!' you're afraid to back down--afraid you'll be found out to be what you are-- cowards --and But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness.
<p/>If any real lynching's going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'll bring their masks, and fetch a man along.
<p/>Now leave --and take your half-a-man with you''--tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gun up across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left arm and cocking it when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says this.
<p/>The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he (<font color='blue'><b>Harkness</b></font>) heeled it after them, looking tolerable cheap.
<p/>Now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.
<p/>I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent.
<p/>I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers that way.
<p/>I ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but there ain't no use in wasting it on them.
<p/>It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds.
<p/>You can't be too careful. It was a real bully circus. It was a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so lovely.
<p/>And then one by one they got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hips, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looking like the most loveliest parasol.
<p/>and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking his (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) whip and shouting <div class="bookquote">``Hi!--hi!''  (<font color='red'><b>the ringmaster</b></font>)</div>and the clown cracking jokes behind him (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>); and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knuckles on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hips and every gentleman folded his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves!
<p/>And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.
<p/>And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out in the air Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the time that clown carried on
<p/>The ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) but he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) was back at him (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) ever could think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't noway understand.
<p/>And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to ride; said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could ride as well as anybody that ever was.
<p/>so it most killed the people. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year. They argued and tried to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't listen, and the whole show come to a standstill.
<p/>Then the people begun to holler at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and make fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Knock him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down! throw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out!
<p/>So, then, the ringmaster he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) made a little speech, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't make no more trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ride if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could stay on the horse.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>and one or two women begun to scream. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on.
<p/>The minute he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bridle trying to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and the drunk man hanging on to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down.
<p/>And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and hanging to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t`other one on t`other side, and the people just crazy.
<p/>But pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood!
<p/>It warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) danger. and the horse a-going like a house afire too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) warn't ever drunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begun to pull off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes and sling them.
<p/>And, then, there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lit into that horse with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whip and made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fairly hum--and finally skipped off, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.
<p/>Then the ringmaster he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) see how he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) had been fooled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) was the sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) shed seventeen suits. Why, it was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) own men!
<p/>Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't a been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) had got up that joke all out of his (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) own head, and never let on to nobody. I don't know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet.
<p/>Anyways, it was plenty good enough for me ; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of my custom every time.
<p/>And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.
<p/>So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) reckoned.
<p/>Well, that night we had our show; but there warn't only about twelve people there--just enough to pay expenses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) could size their style.
<p/>So next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.
<p/>WELL, all day him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time.
<p/>When the place couldn't hold no more, the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and
<p/>at last when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elder</b></font>)'d got everybody's expectations up high enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elder</b></font>) rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow.
<p/>The bills said: CHAPTER XXIII. And--but never mind the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny.
<p/>The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) come back and done it over again, and after that they made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) do it another time.
<p/>Then the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Drury</b></font>) makes them another bow, and says if he (<font color='blue'><b>Drury</b></font>) has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drury</b></font>) will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it.
<p/>Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut. Twenty people sings out: <div class="bookquote">``What, is it over?
<p/>Is that all ?''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>The duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings out, <div class="bookquote">``Sold!''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians.
<p/>But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts: <div class="bookquote">``Hold on! Just a word, gentlemen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>They stopped to listen.
<p/>But we don't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live.
<p/>What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the rest of the town!
<p/>'' We are sold--mighty badly sold. No . Then we'll all be in the same boat. Ain't that sensible? '' -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``You bet it is!--the jedge is right!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>everybody sings out.-RRB- '' All right, then--not a word about any sell. Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.
<p/>'' Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way.
<p/>When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim and me back her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) out and float her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) down the middle of the river, and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in and hide her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) about two mile below town.
<p/>The third night the house was crammed again--and they warn't new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights.
<p/>I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat--and I see it warn't
<p/>I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four of them went in.
<p/>no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight. I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn't stand it.
<p/>Well, when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) give a fellow a quarter and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to tend door for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a minute, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started around for the stage door, I after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says: ``Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you!
<p/>We struck the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river,
<p/>I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) crawls out from under the wigwam, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I done it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) done the same. nobody saying a word. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hadn't been up-town at all. We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.
<p/>Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people.
<p/>I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay for us the third night, and consider it was their turn now.
<p/>The duke says: <div class="bookquote">``Greenhorns, flatheads! Well, it is their turn, and I'd give something to know how much they'd take for it.
<p/>I would just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity. They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty provisions.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div>Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before.
<p/>By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says: <div class="bookquote">``Don't it s`prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``it don't. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why don't it, Huck? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, it don't, because it's in the breed.
<p/>I reckon they're all alike.'' '' But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist what dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions.
<p/>'' '' Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is dat so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You read about them once--you'll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this 'n 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Superintendent</b></font>) . My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he (<font color='blue'><b>Eight</b></font>) was in bloom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Eight</b></font>) was a blossom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Eight</b></font>) used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head next morning. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Eight</b></font>) would do it just as indifferent as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Eight</b></font>) was ordering up eggs. '
<p/>Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwynn</b></font>) says. They fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) up. Next morning, `Chop off her (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) head!' And they chop it off. '
<p/>Fetch up Jane Shore,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwynn</b></font>) says; and up she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) comes, Next morning, `Chop off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head'--and they chop it off. '
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwynn</b></font>) made every one of them tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gwynn</b></font>) a tale every night; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwynn</b></font>) kept that up till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwynn</b></font>) had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gwynn</b></font>) put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the case.
<p/>You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history.
<p/>Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, `Chop off her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwynn</b></font>) head.' Well, Henry he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) takes a notion he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wants to get up some trouble with this country.
<p/>All of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on.
<p/>How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) go at it--give notice?--give the country a show? No. That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) style--he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) never give anybody a chance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had suspicions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) do? Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to show up? No--drownded him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.
<p/>S'pose he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) contracted to do a thing, and you paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and didn't set down there and see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) done it
<p/>S'pose people left money laying around where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was--what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) collared it. --what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) always done the other thing.
<p/>S'pose he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mouth--what then? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) didn't shut it up powerful quick he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'d lose a lie every time. That's the kind of a bug
<p/>Henry was; and if we'd a had him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) along `stead of our kings he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done.
<p/>I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing to that old ram, anyway.
<p/>All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot.

<p/>Dese is all I kin stan'. '' '' It's the way I feel, too, Jim. But we've got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances.
<p/>Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings. '' What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes?
<p/>It wouldn't a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: you couldn't tell them from the real kind.
<p/>When I waked up just at daybreak he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was sitting there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) head down betwixt his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knees, moaning and mourning to himself.
<p/>I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) often done that. I didn't take notice nor let on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was thinking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) children, away up yonder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was low and homesick; because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hadn't ever been away from home before in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) life; and I do believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) cared just as much for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) people as white folks does for
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) judged I was asleep, and saying, ``Po' little `Lizabeth! po' little Johnny!
<p/>I knowed what it was about. their'n . It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so. it's mighty hard ; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!
<p/>But this time I somehow got to talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) wife and young ones; and by and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``What makes me feel so bad dis time `uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I treat my little `Lizabeth so ornery.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) was a mighty good nigger, Jim was. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) warn't on'y `bout fo' year ole , en she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tuck de sk`yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) got well, en one day
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) , I says: ''`Shet de do'.' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me.
<p/>It make me mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says: ''`Doan' you hear me? Shet de do'!' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up.

<p/>NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.
<p/>Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) spoke to the duke, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.
<p/>You see, when we left him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) all alone we had to tie him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), because if anybody happened on to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was a runaway nigger, you know.
<p/>So the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d cipher out some way to get around it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.
<p/>en I'd ben a-treat'n her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so!'' CHAPTER XXIV. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon struck it. Blamed if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.
<p/>Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so: Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) head.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time
<p/>The duke told him (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) reckoned they would light out and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) alone.
<p/>Jim was satisfied. there was a sound. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wouldn't wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to howl.
<p/>These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time.
<p/>They couldn't hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d lay off and work his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) brains an hour or two and see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) couldn't put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would drop over to t`other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.
<p/>We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'n on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) told me to put mine on.
<p/>Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) didn't only look like he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) looked considerable more than that. I done it, of course. The king's duds was all black, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) did look real swell and starchy.
<p/>Why, before, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d take off his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself.
<p/>I never knowed how clothes could change a body before. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready.
<p/>There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple of hours, taking on freight.
<p/>Says the king: <div class="bookquote">``Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.
<p/>Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.
<p/>I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.
<p/>Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his (<font color='blue'><b>Huckleberry</b></font>) face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Huckleberry</b></font>) had a couple of big carpet-bags by him (<font color='blue'><b>Huckleberry</b></font>).
<p/>'' Run her (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) nose in shore,'' says the king. I done it. '' Wher' you bound for, young man?'' <div class="bookquote">``For the steamboat; going to Orleans.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Git aboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>says the king. '' Hold on a minute, my servant 'll he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'p you with them bags. Jump out and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'p the gentleman, Adolphus''--meaning me, I see.
<p/>I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) baggage such weather.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) asked the king where he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was going, and the king told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.
<p/>The young fellow says: <div class="bookquote">``When I first see you I says to myself, `It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) come mighty near getting here in time.'
<p/>But then I says again, `No, I reckon it ain't him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>), or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) wouldn't be paddling up the river.' You ain't him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>), are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, my name's Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett-- Reverend Elexander Blodgett , I s`pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants.
<p/>But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>)'s missed anything by it--which I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) hasn't.
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) don't miss any property by it, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>)'ll get that all right; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>)'s missed seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) brother Peter die--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mayn't mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) brother would a give anything in this world to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) died
<p/>; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) since they was boys together--and hadn't ever seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) brother William at all--that's the deef and dumb one--
<p/>Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife both died last year.
<p/>'' '' William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five. Harvey and William's the only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here in time.
<p/>Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) sorter felt like he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) warn't going to get well this time.
<p/>You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was pretty old, and George's g`yirls was too young to be much company for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was kinder lonesome after George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife died, and didn't seem to care much to live.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and William, too, for that matter--because he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)'d told in it where his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) money was hid, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) wanted the rest of the property divided up so George's g`yirls would be all right--for George didn't leave nothing.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Did anybody send 'em word?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' And that letter was all they could get him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to put a pen to.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? Wher' does he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) live?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) lives in England-- Sheffield--preaches there--hasn't ever been in this country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) hasn't had any too much time--and besides he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) mightn't a got the letter at all, you know. '' <div class="bookquote">``Too bad, too bad he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) couldn't a lived to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) brothers, poor soul.
<p/>You going to Orleans, you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. I'm going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.
<p/>'' '' It's a pretty long journey. But it'll be lovely; wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about fourteen--that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain't going to let them come to no harm.
<p/>There's Hobson, the Babtis' preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and--well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wrote home
<p/>; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) gets here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Well, the old man went on asking questions till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just fairly emptied that young fellow.
<p/>Blamed if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter's business--which was a tanner; and about George's--which was a carpenter; and about Harvey's--which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Because she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mightn't stop there. When they're deep they won't stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Peter Wilks well off?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, yes, pretty well off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) had houses and land, and it's reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) left three or four thousand in cash
<p/>hid up som`ers.'' '' When did you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) died?'' <div class="bookquote">``I didn't say, but it was last night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Funeral to-morrow, likely?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, `bout the middle of the day.'' '' Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or another.
<p/>So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right.'' '' Yes, sir, it's the best way.
<p/>Ma used to always say that. '' When we struck the boat she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was about done loading, and pretty soon she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) got off.
<p/>When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) got ashore and says: <div class="bookquote">``Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpet-bags.
<p/>The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after all. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'s gone over to t`other side, go over there and git him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>And tell him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I see what he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.
<p/>When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a log, and the king told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) everything, just like the young fellow had said it--every last word of it.
<p/>And all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was a-doing it he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) tried to talk like an Englishman; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) done it pretty well, too, for a slouch.
<p/>I can't imitate him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) really done it pretty good. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The duke said, leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) alone for that; said he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards.
<p/>About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sent out her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) yawl, and we went aboard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn't land us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore.
<p/>About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says: ``Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher'
<p/>they give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``What d' I tell you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle: ``I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he (<font color='blue'><b>Kin</b></font>) did live yesterday evening.
<p/>Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up against the man, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, and cried down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>); oh, it's too, too hard!
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) hands, and blamed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alas</b></font>) didn't drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying.
<p/>So then they waited for a steamboat. But the king was ca'm. Mr. Peter Wilks lives? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' '' If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck.
<p/>Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) brother's last moments, and the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) told it all over again on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they'd lost the twelve disciples.
<p/>Well, if ever I struck anything like it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race.
<p/>THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on their coats as they come.
<p/>Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.
<p/>CHAPTER XXV. The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence: <div class="bookquote">``Is it them ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>every minute somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the three girls was standing in the door.
<p/>Mary Jane was red-headed, but that don't make no difference, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was most awful beautiful, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eyes was all lit up like glory
<p/>And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say: <div class="bookquote">``You bet it is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the gang</b></font>)</div>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was so glad her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) uncles was come.
<p/>The king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) spread his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) arms, and Mary Jane she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) jumped for them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!
<p/>Then the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hunched the duke private--I see him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) do it--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so then him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and the duke, with a hand across each other's shoulder, and t`other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping, people saying <div class="bookquote">``Sh!''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.
<p/>And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then they bust out a-crying
<p/>so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other's necks, and hung their chins over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done.
<p/>Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times. And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it.
<p/>Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t`other on t`other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.
<p/>Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show.
<p/>Well, by and by the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) gets up and comes forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) thanks them out of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heart and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) brother's heart, because out of their mouths they can't, words being too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.
<p/>And the minute the words were out of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out.
<p/>I never see anything so disgusting. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.
<p/>Then the king begins to work his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) jaw again, and says how him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) poor brother laying yonder could speak he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knows who he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would name, for they was names that was very dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and mentioned often in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) letters; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev.
<p/>Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.
<p/>--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t`other world, and the preacher was pinting him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) right.
<p/>Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting together Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business.
<p/>But the rest was on hand, and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>); and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads
<p/>whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) made all sorts of signs with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hands and said <div class="bookquote">``Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>all the time, like a baby that can't talk.
<p/>So the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town, by his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) name, and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George's family, or to Peter.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) always let on that Peter wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) the things; but that was a lie: he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.
<p/>Then Mary Jane she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) fetched the letter her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) father left behind, and the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) read it out loud and cried over it.
<p/>It give the dwelling-house and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard -LRB-which was doing a good business-RRB-, along with some other houses and land -LRB-worth about seven thousand-RRB-, and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar.
<p/>So these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.
<p/>We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them yaller-boys.
<p/>My, the way the king's eyes did shine! He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) slaps the duke on the shoulder and says: ``Oh, this ain't bully nor noth`n!
<p/>They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king says: <div class="bookquote">``It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and me, Bilge.
<p/>Oh, no, I reckon not! Why, bully , it beats the Nonesuch, don't it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>The duke allowed it did. Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence.
<p/>It's the best way, in the long run. I've tried 'em all, and ther' ain't no better way. '' Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust; but no, they must count it.
<p/>So they counts it, and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king: <div class="bookquote">``Dern him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then the duke says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was a pretty sick man, and likely he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) made a mistake
<p/>--I reckon that's the way of it. The best way's to let it go, and keep still about it. We can spare it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, shucks, yes, we can spare it. I don't k`yer noth'n `bout that --it's the count I'm thinkin' about. We want to be awful square and open and above-board here, you know.
<p/>But when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, you know, we don't want to--''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hold on,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>says the duke.
<p/>We want to lug this h-yer money up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther' ain't noth'n suspicious. '' Le's make up the deffisit,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>Blest if the old Nonesuch ain't a heppin' us out agin,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up.
<p/>'' It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke--you have got a rattlin' clever head on you,'' says the king. '' It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>says the duke, <div class="bookquote">``I got another idea. Le's go up stairs and count this money, and then take and give it to the girls .''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/>``Good land, duke, lemme hug you! It's the most dazzling idea `at ever a man struck. You have cert`nly got the most astonishin' head I ever see.
<p/>Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake `bout it. Let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this 'll lay 'em out.
<p/>When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty elegant little piles.
<p/>Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) loved and sheltered, and that's left fatherless and motherless.
<p/>Yes, and we that knowed him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would a done more generous by 'em if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) dear William and me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their chops. Now, wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)? Ther' ain't no question `bout it in my mind.
<p/>Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) way at sech a time? And what kind o' uncles would it be that 'd rob--yes,
<p/>rob --sech poor sweet lambs as these `at he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) loved so at sech a time? If I know William--and I think I do--he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)--well, I'll jest ask him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hands, and the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stupid and leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seems to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might for joy, and hugs him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) about fifteen times before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lets up.
<p/>'' Then the king says, ``I knowed it; I reckon that 'll convince anybody the way he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) feels about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it all .
<p/>Mary Jane she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) went for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.
<p/>And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying all the time: <div class="bookquote">``You dear good souls!--how lovely !
<p/>Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again, and how good he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was, and what a loss he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was, and all that; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) either, because the king was talking
<p/>It's the gift of him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) that lays yonder, cold but joyful. ''  (<font color='red'><b>frauds</b></font>)</div>--how could you! '' and they was all busy listening.
<p/>The king was saying--in the middle of something he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d started in on-- ''--they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased. That's why they're invited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want all to come--everybody
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every little while he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fetched in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) funeral orgies again, till the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) couldn't stand it no more; so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) writes on a little scrap of paper, '' Obsequies , you old fool,'' and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people's heads to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).
<p/>The king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) reads it and puts it in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) pocket, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Poor William, afflicted as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) is, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heart's aluz right.
<p/>; for he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) respected everybody, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) liked everybody, and so it's fitten that his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) funeral orgies sh'd be public.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) needn't a worried--it was jest what I was at. '' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) funeral orgies again every now
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) done it the third time he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it ain't--obsequies bein' the common term--but because orgies is the right term.
<p/>and then, just like he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) done before. Obsequies ain't used in England no more now--it's gone out. We say orgies now in England.
<p/>It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek orgo , outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew jeesum , to plant, cover up; hence in ter.
<p/>Orgies is better, because it means the thing you're after more exact. So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public funeral.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was the worst I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) laughed right in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face. Everybody was shocked.
<p/>Everybody says, <div class="bookquote">``Why, doctor !''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>and Abner Shackleford says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Abner Shackleford</b></font>)</div><p/>The king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) smiled eager, and shoved out his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) flapper, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician? I--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>flapper</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Keep your hands off of me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>says the doctor. '' You talk like an Englishman, don't you? It's the worst imitation I ever heard.
<p/>They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) down, and tried to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) how Harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) was Harvey, and knowed everybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) not to hurt Harvey's feelings and the poor girl's feelings, and all that.
<p/>But it warn't no use; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) stormed right along, and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) did was a fraud and a liar.
<p/>The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you as a friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), the ignorant tramp, with his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) idiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) calls it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) picked up somewheres, and you take them for proofs , and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here, who ought to know better.
<p/>You Peter Wilks's brother! You're a fraud, that's what you are! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Well, how they all took on! Mary Jane Wilks, you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.
<p/>Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I beg you to do it. Will you?'' Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was handsome!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hove up the bag of money and put it in the king's hands, and says, <div class="bookquote">``Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to, and don't give us no receipt for it.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the hare-lip done the same on the other.
<p/>Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) head and smiled proud.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) says: ''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>Here is my answer. '' '' The doctor says: ``All right; I wash my hands of the matter.
<p/>But I warn you all that a time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this day.
<p/>kinder mocking him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``we'll try and get 'em to send for you;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which made them all laugh, and they said it was a prime good hit.
<p/>when they was all gone the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had one spare room, which would do for Uncle William, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'d give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a little bigger, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would turn into the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sisters and sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.
<p/>'' And away he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) went. '' All right, doctor,'' says the king, CHAPTER XXVI. WELL, The king said the cubby would do for his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) valley--meaning me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'d have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) said they warn't.
<p/>The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.
<p/>There was an old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room with.
<p/>So Mary Jane took us up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) showed them their rooms, which was plain but nice. The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings, and so don't disturb them.
<p/>That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there, and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them, and the niggers waited on the rest.
<p/>Mary Jane she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) set at the head of the table, with Susan alongside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), and said how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said so--said <div class="bookquote">``How do you get biscuits to brown so nice?''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Where, for the land's sake, did you get these amaz'n pickles?''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know.
<p/>And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things.
<p/>The hare-lip she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got to pumping me about England, and blest if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes.
<p/>The duke's room was pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see the king?''

<p/>So when I says he (<font color='blue'><b>Fourth</b></font>) goes to our church, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``What--regular?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But you always went to church. '' Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man's servant.
<p/>But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the law.
<p/>But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) warn't satisfied. She (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?

<p/>So then she (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) looked a little better satisfied, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I'll believe the rest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said it. '' ''

<p/>What is it you won't believe, Joe?'' says Mary Jane, stepping in with Susan behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). '' How would you like to be treated so?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s told some stretchers, I reckon, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's every bit and grain I did say.
<p/>'' That's always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before they're hurt. I hain't done nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>). I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) can stand a little thing like that, can't he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)?''

<p/>The thing is for you to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) kind , and not be saying things to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) remember he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) ain't in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) own country and amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) own folks.

'' I says to myself, this is a girl that I'm letting that old reptile rob her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money!
<p/>Then Susan she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb! Says I to myself, and this is another one that I'm letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) rob her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money!
<p/>Then Mary Jane she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again--which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) way; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) got done there warn't hardly anything left o' poor Hare-lip.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hollered. '' All right, then,'' says the other girls; <div class="bookquote">``you just ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pardon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) done it, too; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) done it beautiful.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) done it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a thousand lies, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could do it again.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.
<p/>I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up; I'll hive that money for them or bust.
<p/>I says to myself, this is another one that I'm letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) rob her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) money. So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.
<p/>When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?
<p/>No--that won't do. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) might tell who told him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); then the king and the duke would make it warm for me.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was to fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge.
<p/>I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion that I done it.
<p/>They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time enough.
<p/>I'll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid.
<p/>But I better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lets on he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) might scare them out of here yet.
<p/>Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No--I dasn't do it. No; there ain't no good way but one. So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms.
<p/>Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own self; so then I went to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) room and begun to paw around there.
<p/>But I see I couldn't do nothing without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judged I'd got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.
<p/>About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.
<p/>They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed.
<p/>Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private.
<p/>They sets down then, and the king says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it? And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for us to be down there
<p/>a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a chance to talk us over. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>'' Well, this is it, Capet.
<p/>I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound one.
<p/>``That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we've got.
<p/>Specially, seeing we got it so easy-- given back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back.
<p/>About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says: <div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The king</b></font>)</div>'' What is it, duke?'' I'm for knocking off and lighting out. '' That made me feel pretty bad. And not sell out the rest o' the property?
<p/>March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in?--and all good, salable stuff, too.
<p/>'' The duke he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) didn't want to go no deeper-- didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had.
<p/>'' Why, how you talk!'' says the king. '' We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money.
<p/>The people that buys the property is the suff`rers; because as soon 's it's found out `at we didn't own it--which won't be long after we've slid--the sale won't be valid, and it 'll all go back to the estate.
<p/>These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin, and that's enough for them ; they're young and spry, and k'n easy earn a livin'.
<p/>they ain't a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think--there's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off. Bless you, they ain't got noth'n' to complain of.
<p/>Well, the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) talked him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) blind; so at last he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) give in, and said all right, but said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them.
<p/>'' But the king says: <div class="bookquote">``Cuss the doctor! What do we k`yer for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ? Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side?
<p/>And ain't that a big enough majority in any town? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>So they got ready to go down stairs again. The duke says: <div class="bookquote">``I don't think we put that money in a good place.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div>That cheered me up. I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint of no kind to help me.
<p/>Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?''
<p/>The king says: <div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>The king</b></font>)</div>'' '' Your head's level agin, duke,'' says the king; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) comes a-fumbling under the curtain
<p/>I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I'd better do if they did catch me.
<p/>But the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) never suspicioned I was around.
<p/>They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and
<p/>two or three foot from where I was. so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now. But I knowed better.
<p/>I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better.
<p/>I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well.
<p/>Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business.
<p/>By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was going to happen.
<p/>So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.
<p/>But nothing did. CHAPTER XXVII. I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right.
<p/>I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.
<p/>There warn't a sound anywheres. The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms.
<p/>but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there.
<p/>I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn't nobody in there Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.
<p/>I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin.
<p/>The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shroud on.
<p/>I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) handkerchief, and I see she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) back was to me.
<p/>The person coming was Mary Jane. I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me
<p/>I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it.
<p/>Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could dig him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up again and get it; but that ain't the thing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid.
<p/>Then the king 'll get it again, and it 'll be a long day before he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right. They hadn't stirred. Of course I wanted to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it.
<p/>Every minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of.
<p/>I don't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself. When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the watchers was gone.
<p/>There warn't nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn't tell.
<p/>Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) man, and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.
<p/>I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with folks around.
<p/>Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little.
<p/>the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church.
<p/>When the place was packed full the undertaker he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) slid around in his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) black gloves with his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) never spoke; he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) moved people around, he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) squeezed in late ones, he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) hands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't no more smile to him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) than there is to a ham.
<p/>They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion.
<p/>Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hobson</b></font>) made a most powerful racket, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hobson</b></font>) kept it up right along; the parson he (<font color='blue'><b>Hobson</b></font>) had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you couldn't hear yourself think.
<p/>There warn't no other sound but Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hobson</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Hobson</b></font>) place over against the wall. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn't seem to know what to do.
<p/>But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you worry--just depend on me.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had gone around two sides of the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) disappears down cellar.
<p/>Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) solemn talk where he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) left off.
<p/>In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) hands, and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) neck out towards the preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, ''  (<font color='red'><b>the preacher</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) had a rat !
<p/>'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) shoulders showing over the people's heads. ''
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) drooped down and glided along the wall again to his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know.
<p/>A little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked.
<p/>Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shoved in and got off some of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) usual rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) screw-driver.
<p/>There warn't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was. I was in a sweat then, and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) pretty keen.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.
<p/>So, says I, s`pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not?
<p/>So there I was! I didn't know whether the money was in there or not. S'pose she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dug him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) up and didn't find nothing
<p/>Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness
<p/>, what would she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) think of me? I'd just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business! They buried him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>), and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again--
<p/>The king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and made himself ever so friendly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) give out the idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.
<p/>I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy. But nothing come of it; the faces didn't tell me nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was very sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was so pushed, and so was everybody
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) said of course him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled them
<p/>so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to sell out as quick as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wanted to, they would be ready.
<p/>Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune.
<p/>Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.
<p/>; they wished he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) could stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done. So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy got the first jolt.
<p/>A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans.
<p/>I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.
<p/>I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't
<p/>The girls said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town. no account and
<p/>The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way.
<p/>It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy.
<p/>About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look that there was trouble.
<p/>the niggers would be back home in a week or two. Next day was auction day. The king says: <div class="bookquote">``Was you in my room night before last?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The king</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, your majesty''--which was the way I always called him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) when nobody but our gang warn't around. '' Was you in there yisterday er last night?''
<p/>'' No, your majesty. '' '' Honor bright, now--no lies.'' '' Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth. I hain't been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you.
<p/>'' The duke says: <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen anybody else go in there?''  (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div>'' No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Stop and think. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says: ``Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.
<p/>Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't ever expected it, and then like they had .
<p/>Then the duke says: <div class="bookquote">``What, all of them?''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don't think I ever see them all come out at once but just one time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Hello! When was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn't early, because I overslept.
<p/>I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them. '' <div class="bookquote">``Well, go on, go on! What did they do?
<p/>They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in there to do up your majesty's room, or something, s`posing you was up; and found you warn't up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>How'd they act?'' '' They didn't do nothing. And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as I see. <div class="bookquote">``Great guns, this is a go!''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>says the king; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly.
<p/>They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says: <div class="bookquote">``It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.
<p/>They let on to be sorry they was going out of this region! And I believed they was sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.
<p/>Don't ever tell me any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that thing it would fool anybody .
<p/>If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a better lay-out than that--and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song.
<p/>In my opinion, there's a fortune in 'em. Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where is that song--that draft?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the bank for to be collected. Where would it be?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, that's all right then, thank goodness. '' Says I,
<p/>kind of timid-like: <div class="bookquote">``Is something gone wrong? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The king whirls on me and rips out: <div class="bookquote">``None o' your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own affairs--if you got any.
<p/>Long as you're in this town don't you forgit that --you hear? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) says to the duke, <div class="bookquote">``We got to jest swaller it and say noth'n':
<p/>mum's the word for us . ''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>As they was starting down the ladder the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) chuckles again, and says: ``Quick sales and small profits!
<p/>The king snarls around on him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) and says: <div class="bookquote">``I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick.
<p/>It's a good business--yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to carry, is it my fault
<p/>any more'n it's yourn?'' '' Well, they'd be in this house yet and we wouldn't if I could a got my advice listened to.
<p/>'' The king sassed back as much as was safe for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and then swapped around and lit into me again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) give me down the banks for not coming and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) I see the niggers come out of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) room acting that way--said any fool would a knowed something was up.
<p/>And then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile, and said it all come of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) not laying late and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) natural rest that morning,
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'d be blamed if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'d ever do it again. So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I'd worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it.
<p/>So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) old hair trunk, which was open and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'d been packing things in it--getting ready to go to England.
<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII. BY and by it was getting-up time. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had stopped now with a folded gown in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) lap, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hands, crying.
<p/>I went in there and says: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can't--most always.
<p/>I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. Tell me about it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) done it. And it was the niggers--I just expected it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) didn't know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no more--and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hands, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't ever going to see each other any more!''
 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>But they will --and inside of two weeks--and I know it!'' says I. Laws, it was out before I could think!
<p/>And before I could budge she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) throws her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) arms around my neck and told me to say it again , say it again , say it again !
<p/>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to let me think a minute; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out.
<p/>'' I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. So I went to studying it out.
<p/>I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie.
<p/>I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's so kind of strange and unregular.
<p/>I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to.
<p/>Then I says: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, '' Yes; Mr. Lothrop's. Why?'' <div class="bookquote">``Never mind why yet.
<p/>If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and prove how I know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>All right,'' I says, ``I don't want nothing more out of you than just your word--I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, ``If you don't mind it, I'll shut the door--and bolt it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four days! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``I'll stay a year!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Then I come back and set down again, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Don't you holler.
<p/>I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for it.
<p/>Just set still and take it like a man. These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of frauds--regular dead-beats.
<p/>It jolted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) flung herself on to the king's breast at the front door
<p/>There, now we're over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling easy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sixteen or seventeen times--
<p/>and then up she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) jumps, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face afire like sunset, and says: <div class="bookquote">``The brute! Come, don't waste a minute--not a second --we'll
<p/>have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Says I: <div class="bookquote">``Cert`nly. But do you mean before you go to Mr. Lothrop's, or--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``what am I thinking about! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says, and set right down again. '' Don't mind what I said--please don't--you won't, now, will you?
<p/>'' Laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first. ''
<p/>I never thought, I was so stirred up,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``now go on, and I won't do so any more. You tell me what to do, and whatever you say I'll do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``it's a rough gang, them two frauds, and I'm fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--
<p/>I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be another person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble.
<p/>Well, we got to save him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) , hain't we? Of course. Well, then, we won't blow on them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Saying them words put a good idea in my head.
<p/>I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.
<p/>But I didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night.
<p/>I says: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stay at Mr. Lothrop's so long, nuther.
<p/>How fur is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here. '' '' Well, that 'll answer.
<p/>Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again--tell them you've thought of something.
<p/>If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don't turn up wait till eleven, and then if I don't turn up it means I'm gone, and out of the way, and safe.
<p/>Then you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``I'll do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha'n't touch a hair of your head! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says, and I see her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) nostrils spread and her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes snap when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said it, too.
<p/>If I get away I sha'n't be here,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``to prove these rapscallions ain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I was here.
<p/>can do that better than what I can, and they're people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could swear they was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something. Well, there's others I'll tell you how to find them.
<p/>When the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses--why, you'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.
<p/>Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There--`Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.' Put it away, and don't lose it. And they'll come a-biling, too.
<p/>'' I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says: <div class="bookquote">``Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry.
<p/>Nobody don't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till they get that money; and the way we've fixed it
<p/>the sale ain't going to count, and they ain't going to get no money. It's just like the way it was with the niggers--
<p/>it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be back before long. Why, they can't collect the money for the niggers yet--
<p/>they're in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start straight for Mr. Lothrop's.

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?'' '' Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don't know.
<p/>What was it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. I don't want no better book than what your face is.
<p/>A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--

<p/>I don't want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.
<p/>They've got to stand it yet a while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of them.
<p/>I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the morning.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, it sha'n't be.
<p/>It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it's the little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing.
<p/>'' It was well enough to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) so--no harm in it. Then I says: <div class="bookquote">``There's one more thing--that bag of money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it.'' '' No, you're out, there.
<p/>I had it, because I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm afraid it ain't there
<p/>They hain't got it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, who's got it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish I knowed, but I don't. no more. I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane
<p/>I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run--and it warn't a good place.
<p/>, I'm just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could ; I did honest. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, stop blaming yourself--it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow it-- you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault.
<p/>I didn't want to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) troubles again; and I couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) what would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stomach.
<p/>So for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says: <div class="bookquote">``I'd ruther not tell you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't mind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to.
<p/>Where did you hide it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Do you reckon that 'll do?'' '' Oh, yes. '' So I wrote: <div class="bookquote">``I put it in the coffin.
<p/>It was in there when you was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.
<p/>It made my eyes water a little to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own roof, shaming her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and robbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); and when I folded it up and give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
<p/>I see the water come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eyes, too; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shook me by the hand, hard, and says: ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Good -bye.
<p/>if I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think of you a many and a many a time, and
<p/>'' I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and I'll pray for you, too!''--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was gone. Pray for me!
<p/>I reckoned if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knowed me she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'d take a job that was more nearer her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) size. But I bet she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) done it, just the same
<p/>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was just that kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had the grit to pray for Judus if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) took the notion--there warn't no back-down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), I judge.
<p/>You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had more sand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was just full of sand.
<p/>It sounds like flattery, but it ain't no flattery. And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) lays over them all.
<p/>I hain't ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) since that time that I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) since, but I reckon I've thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a many and a many a million times, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) , blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.
<p/>When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says: <div class="bookquote">``What's the name of them people over on t`other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes?

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What other things?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know what all.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``My land! And they call it the mumps ?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Miss Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>'' That's what Miss Mary Jane said. '' '' Well, what in the nation do they call it the mumps for?''
<p/>A body might stump his (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) neck, and bust his (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and some numskull up and say, `Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) stumped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) toe .'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, because it is the mumps. That's what it starts with.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, ther' ain't no sense in it. Would ther' be any sense in that?
<p/>No . And ther' ain't no sense in this , nuther. Is it ketching?'' '' Is it ketching ? Why, how you talk.
<p/>Is a harrow catching--in the dark? If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another, ain't you?
<p/>Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say--and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good.''
<p/>And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you? '' Well, it's awful, I think,'' says the hare-lip.
<p/>'' I'll go to Uncle Harvey and-- '' '' Oh, yes,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``I would . Of course I would. I wouldn't lose no time.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says, `Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run over the river to see Mr.'--Mr.--what is the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said, don't say nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which 'll be perfectly true, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know it, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) told me so herself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>uncles</b></font>)</div><p/>All right,'' they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.
<p/>The girls wouldn't say nothing because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson.
<p/>I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself.
<p/>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) would a throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not being brung up to it.
<p/>Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on hand and looking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) level pisonest, up there longside of the auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.
<p/>But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.
<p/>So they'd got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything .
<p/>Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:
<p/>they had it than anybody else; '' Everything was all right now. '' Here's your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old Peter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!''
<p/>THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a nice-looking younger one, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right arm in a sling.
<p/>But I didn't see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIX. And, my souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. I reckoned they'd turn pale. But no, nary a pale did they turn.
<p/>The duke he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) never let on he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) suspicioned what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the stomach-ache in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world.
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to let him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) see they was on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) side.
<p/>Pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) begun to speak, and I see straight off he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) pronounced like an Englishman--not the king's way, though the king's was pretty good for an imitation.
<p/>I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate him (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>gent</b></font>) turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this: ``This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and answer it
<p/>; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s broke his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake.
<p/>I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>) brother William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to amount to much, now't he (<font color='blue'><b>Harvey</b></font>)'s only got one hand to work them with.
<p/>We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it.
<p/>That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait.
<p/>So him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and the new dummy started off; and the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) laughs, and blethers out: <div class="bookquote">``Broke his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) arm-- very likely, ain't it?--and very convenient, too, for a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lost their baggage! That's mighty good!--and mighty ingenious--under the circumstances ! '' So he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or maybe half a dozen.
<p/>One of these was that doctor; another one was a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king now.
<p/>And when the king got done this husky up and says: <div class="bookquote">``Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this town?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The day before the funeral, friend,'' says the king. '' But what time o' day?'' <div class="bookquote">``In the evenin'--`bout an hour er two before sundown.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' How'd you come?'' <div class="bookquote">``I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the mornin
<p/>Several of them jumped for him (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Powell</b></font>) not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher.
<p/>'--in a canoe?'' <div class="bookquote">``I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It's a lie. '' '' Preacher be hanged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Preacher</b></font>)'s a fraud and a liar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Preacher</b></font>) was up at the Pint that mornin'. I live up there, don't I? Well, I was up there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Preacher</b></font>) was up there.
<p/>I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Preacher</b></font>) there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Preacher</b></font>) come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy. '' The doctor he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) up and says: <div class="bookquote">``Would you know the boy again if you was to see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), Hines?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I reckon I would, but I don't know. Why, yonder he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is, now. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) perfectly easy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It was me he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pointed at.
<p/>The doctor says: <div class="bookquote">``Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if these two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all.
<p/>I think it's our duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.
<p/>We'll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t`other couple, and I reckon we'll find out something before we get through.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so we all started. It was about sundown.
<p/>The doctor he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) led me along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) never let go my hand.
<p/>We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and fetched in the new couple.
<p/>First, the doctor says: <div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about.
<p/>If these men ain't frauds, they won't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're all right--
<p/>If they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It ain't unlikely. ain't that so?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart.
<p/>But the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) only looked sorrowful, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send and see, if you want to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) I took and hid it inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein' used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England.
<p/>The niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down stairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got clean away with it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is it, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>servant k</b></font>)</div>'' My servant here k'n tell you `bout it, gentlemen. '' The doctor and several said <div class="bookquote">``Shucks!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>and I see nobody didn't altogether believe him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never thought nothing
<p/>, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) made trouble with them.
<p/>That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and says: <div class="bookquote">``Are you English, too? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I says yes; and him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) and some others laughed, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Stuff!
<p/>Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>some others</b></font>)</div>and so they kept it up, and kept it up; and it was the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.
<p/>They made the king tell his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)`n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t`other one lies.
<p/>The king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side.
<p/>I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says: <div class="bookquote">``Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you.
<p/>And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed. I reckon you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is practice.
<p/>You do it pretty awkward. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off, anyway.
<p/>The king broke in and reached out his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hand, and says: ``Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s wrote so often about?
<p/>The doctor he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) started to say something, and turns and says: <div class="bookquote">``If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>The lawyer and him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says: <div class="bookquote">``That 'll fix it.
<p/>So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) set down and twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) head to one side, and chawed his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the duke looked sick.
<p/>I'll take the order and send it, along with your brother's, and then they'll know it's all right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took the pen and wrote.
<p/>So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says: ``You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.
<p/>The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, it beats me '' (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div>--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then them again; and then says: <div class="bookquote">``These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here's these two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't write them''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the king and the duke looked sold and foolish
<p/>, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and here's this old gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) didn't write them
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. --fact is, the scratches he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) makes ain't properly writing at all.
<p/>Now, here's some letters from-- '' The new old gentleman says: <div class="bookquote">``If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand
<p/>but my brother there --so he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) copies for me. It's his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand you've got there, not mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div>'' Well !'' says the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``this is a state of things.
<p/>I've got some of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to write a line or so we can com--''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) can't write with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) left hand,'' says the old gentleman. '' If he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could use his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right hand, you would see that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own letters and mine too.
<p/>The lawyer done it, and says: <div class="bookquote">``I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.
<p/>Look at both, please-- they're by the same hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The lawyer</b></font>)</div>Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass, partly.
<p/>But anyway, one thing is proved-- these two ain't either of 'em Wilkses''--and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) head towards the king and the duke.
<p/>Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in then ! Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wouldn't. Said it warn't no fair test.
<p/>Said his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried to write-- he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) see William was going to play one of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) jokes the minute he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) put the pen to paper.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was actuly beginning to believe what he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was saying himself ; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says: <div class="bookquote">``I've thought of something.
<p/>Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Then the old man turns towards the king, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) breast?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice, because how was he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) going to know what was tattooed on the man?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) whitened a little; he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>Yes,'' says somebody, <div class="bookquote">``me and Ab Turner done it. We're both here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>Says I to myself, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>)'ll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.
<p/>I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>)'d keep the thing up till he (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>) tired them people out, so they'd thin out, and him (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>) and the duke could break loose and get away.
<p/>Well, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>)? A body can't hardly believe it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>) didn't. Anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>) set there, and pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>) begun to smile, and says: ``Mf!
<p/>It's a very tough question, ain't it! yes , sir, I k'n tell you what's tattooed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Turner</b></font>) breast. It's jest a small, thin, blue arrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.
<p/>The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye lights up like he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) judged he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d got the king this time, and says: <div class="bookquote">``There--you've heard what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said!
<p/>now what do you say--hey? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek. Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks' breast?''
<p/>Now, what you did see on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) breast was a small dim P, and a B -LRB-which is an initial he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) dropped when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilks</b></font>) was young-RRB-, and a W, with dashes between them, so: P--B--
<p/>Both of them spoke up and says: <div class="bookquote">``We didn't see no such mark.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>says the old gentleman. '' W''--and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) marked them that way on a piece of paper.
<p/>'' Come, ain't that what you saw?'' Both of them spoke up again, and says: <div class="bookquote">``No, we didn't . We never seen any marks at all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>Well, everybody was in a state of mind now, and they sings out: <div class="bookquote">``The whole bilin ' of 'm 's frauds!
<p/>Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em! le's ride 'em on a rail! ''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling powwow.
<p/>But the lawyer he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) jumps on the table and yells, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen--gentle men! Hear me just a word--just a single word--if you please !
<p/>There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That took them. <div class="bookquote">``Hooray! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out: <div class="bookquote">``Hold on, hold on!
<p/>Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch them along, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll do it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they all shouted; <div class="bookquote">``and if we don't find them marks we'll lynch the whole gang!
<p/>They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening.
<p/>As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) the wink she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'d light out and save me, and blow on our dead-beats.
<p/>Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't no getting away, you know. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome
<p/>; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death
<p/>I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for but just them tattoo-marks.
<p/>If they didn't find them-- I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think about nothing else.
<p/>It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hines</b></font>) dragged me right along, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hines</b></font>) was so excited, and I had to run to keep up. When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow.
<p/>And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern.
<p/>But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow one.
<p/>So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of it
<p/>, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.
<p/>At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful.
<p/>Hines he (<font color='blue'><b>Hines</b></font>) hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Hines</b></font>) clean forgot I was in the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hines</b></font>) was so excited and panting.
<p/>All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out: <div class="bookquote">``By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hines</b></font>) breast!''
 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his (<font color='blue'><b>Hines</b></font>) way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.
<p/>I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!
<p/>, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our house
<p/>When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm I aimed my eye and set it.
<p/>No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, flash comes the light in Mary Jane's window!
<p/>and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world.
<p/>The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand. I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope.
<p/>The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last
<p/>I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn't.
<p/>As I sprung aboard I sung out: <div class="bookquote">``Out with you, Jim, and set her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loose! Glory be to goodness, we're shut of them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me.
<p/>But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was so glad I was back
<p/>and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says: <div class="bookquote">``Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!
<p/>So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and nobody to bother us.
<p/>Cut loose and let her (<font color='blue'><b>ourselves</b></font>) slide!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my heels a few times--
<p/>I couldn't help it; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum!
<p/>So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all I could do to keep from crying.
<p/>WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!
<p/>It was the king and the duke. CHAPTER XXX. Tired of our company, hey? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I says: <div class="bookquote">``No, your majesty, we warn't-- please don't, your majesty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Quick, then, and tell us what was your idea, or I'll shake the insides out o' you!'' <div class="bookquote">``Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.
<p/>The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lets go of me and whispers, '
<p/>It didn't seem no good for me to stay--I couldn't do nothing, and I didn't want to be hung if I could get away.
<p/>So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming
<p/>Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit out. ; you may ask Jim if I didn't. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim said it was so; and the king told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to shut up, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, it's mighty likely!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and shook me up again, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'d drownd me.
<p/>But the duke says: <div class="bookquote">``Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would you a done any different? Did you inquire around for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when you got loose?
<p/>I don't remember it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it.
<p/>But the duke says: <div class="bookquote">``You better a blame' sight give yourself a good cussing, for you're the one that's entitled to it most.
<p/>You hain't done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark.
<p/>That was bright--it was right down bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn't been for that they'd a jailed us till them
<p/>But that trick took 'em to the graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look
<p/>Englishmen's baggage come--and then--the penitentiary, you bet! we'd a slept in our cravats to-night-- cravats warranted to wear , too--longer than we'd need 'em.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>They was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of absent-minded like: <div class="bookquote">``Mf! And we reckoned the niggers stole it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div><p/>That made me squirm! '' Yes,'' says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, '' we did. '' After about a half a minute the king drawls out: <div class="bookquote">``Leastways, I did.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>The duke says, the same way: <div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I did. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div>The king kind of ruffles up, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>king</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Shucks!''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>says the king, very sarcastic; ``but I don't know--maybe you was asleep, and didn't know what you was about.
<p/>The duke says, pretty brisk: <div class="bookquote">``When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was you referring to? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div><p/>The duke bristles up now, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, let up on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?
<p/>Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?''  (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div>'' Yes , sir! I know you do know, because you done it yourself!''
<p/>'' It's a lie!''--and the duke went for him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). The king sings out: <div class="bookquote">``Take y'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The king</b></font>)</div><p/>The duke says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, you just own up, first, that you did hide that money there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it up, and have it all to yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The duke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair; if you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b`lieve you, and take back everything I said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>But answer me only jest this one more--now don't git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?''
<p/>The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) says: ``Well, I don't care if I did , I didn't do it, anyway.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't. There, now!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, I b`lieve you. But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you done it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest. I won't say I warn't goin' to do it, because I was ; but you--I mean somebody--got in ahead
<p/>You done it, and you got to say you done it, or--''  (<font color='red'><b>The king</b></font>)</div>The king began to gurgle, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) gasps out: '''
<p/>I was very glad to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) say that; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before.
<p/>o' me. '' '' It's a lie! Nough!--I own up! '' So the duke took his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hands off and says: <div class="bookquote">``If you ever deny it again I'll drown you.
<p/>It's well for you to set there and blubber like a baby-- it's fitten for you, after the way you've acted.
<p/>I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father.
<p/>You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.
<p/>Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it all !''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/>The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling: <div class="bookquote">``Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The king</b></font>)</div><p/>It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to believe that rubbage. <div class="bookquote">``Dry up! I don't want to hear no more out of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>says the duke.
<p/>'' And now you see what you GOT by it. They've got all their own money back, and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides .
<p/>So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled HIS (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms.
<p/>They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again.
<p/>G'long to bed, and don't you deffersit me no more deffersits, long 's you live! '' That made me feel easy and satisfied.
<p/>Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything. CHAPTER XXXI. WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river.
<p/>We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.
<p/>It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.
<p/>Then in another village they started a dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town.
<p/>Another time they tried to go at yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.
<p/>They tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck.
<p/>So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.
<p/>And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.
<p/>First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough for them both to get drunk on. Jim and me got uneasy.
<p/>We turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money business, or something.
<p/>So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind.
<p/>Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet.
<p/>We didn't like the look of it. We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``House to rob, you mean ,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I to myself; <div class="bookquote">``and
<p/>when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft--and you'll have to take it out in wondering.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-RRB-
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.
<p/>So we stayed where we was. The duke he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) scolded us for everything, and we couldn't seem to do nothing right; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) found fault with every little thing.
<p/>I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for the change on top of it.
<p/>So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyragging him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) for sport, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) a-cussing and a-threatening with all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might, and so tight he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to them.
<p/>The duke he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) begun to abuse him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) for an old fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it
<p/>I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again.
<p/>Something was a-brewing, sure. I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out: <div class="bookquote">``Set her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) loose, Jim!
<p/>I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn't no use--old Jim was gone.
<p/>we're all right now! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was gone! Then I set down and cried; I couldn't help it.
<p/>Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But I couldn't set still long. <div class="bookquote">``Whereabouts?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>says I. <div class="bookquote">``Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>)'s a runaway nigger, and they've got him (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>).
<p/>I run across him (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) in the woods about an hour or two ago, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) said if I hollered he (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>)'d cut my livers out--and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it.
<p/>Was you looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' You bet I ain't! Been there ever since; afeard to come out. '' '' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) run off f'm down South, som`ers.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' It's a good job they got him (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>).'' '' Well, I reckon ! There's two hunderd dollars reward on him (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>).
<p/>It's like picking up money out'n the road.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) first .
<p/>It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sold out his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) chance in him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) for forty dollars, becuz he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)'s got to go up the river and can't wait.
<p/>Who nailed him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Think o' that, now! You bet I'd wait, if it was seven year.'' '' That's me, every time,'' says I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But maybe his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) chance ain't worth no more than that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)'ll sell it so cheap. Maybe there's something ain't straight about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>It tells all about him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), to a dot--paints him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) like a picture, and tells the plantation he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)'s frum, below Newr leans .
<p/>'' But it is , though--straight as a string. I see the handbill myself. No-sirree- bob , they ain't no trouble `bout that speculation, you bet you.
<p/>Say, gimme a chaw tobacker, won't ye? '' I didn't have none, so he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) left. I went to the raft, and set down in the wigwam to think.
<p/>But I couldn't come to nothing. I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble.
<p/>After all this long journey, and after all we'd done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) a slave again all his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars.
<p/>Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) family was, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d got to be a slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) to tell Miss Watson where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) was.
<p/>But I soon give up that notion for two things: she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)'d be mad and disgusted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)'d sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) straight down the river again; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make Jim feel it all the time,
<p/>It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) boots for shame.
<p/>That's just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) don't want to take no consequences of it.
<p/>and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>)'d feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of me ! Thinks as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) can hide it
<p/>The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery
<p/>And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was showing me
<p/>there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and
<p/>, it ain't no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. I got to feeling. no further, I most dropped in my tracks
<p/>Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and
<p/>so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, <div class="bookquote">``There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it
<p/>I was so scared. so I warn't they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.
<p/>And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It made me shiver. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they? It warn't no use to try and hide it from Him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Nor from me , neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was because my heart warn't right ; it was because I warn't
<p/>I was letting on to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all.
<p/>I was trying to make my mouth say I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) was; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) knowed it.
<p/>square ; it was because I was playing double. You can't pray a lie--I found that out. So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do.
<p/>At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and then see if I can pray.
<p/>Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.
<p/>So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote: Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) up for the reward if you send.
<p/>I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.
<p/>But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell.
<p/>And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.
<p/>Huck Finn. And went on thinking. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>), but only the other kind.
<p/>I'd see him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) standing my watch on top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>)`n, `stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) how glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) could think of for me, and how good he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old
<p/>Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.
<p/>It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it.
<p/>I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: <div class="bookquote">``All right, then, I'll go to hell'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--and tore it up.
<p/>It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.
<p/>I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.
<p/>And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.
<p/>Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me.
<p/>So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.
<p/>I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.
<p/>I landed below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) and sunk her (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) where I could find her (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) again when I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>), about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
<p/>Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, <div class="bookquote">``Phelps's Sawmill,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.
<p/>But I didn't mind, because I didn't want to see nobody just yet --I only wanted to get the lay of the land.
<p/>According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town.
<p/>Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night performance--like that other time.
<p/>They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) before I could shirk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) looked astonished, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Hel- lo !
<p/>Where'd you come from? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) says, kind of glad and eager, <div class="bookquote">``Where's the raft?--got her (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) in a good place?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) didn't look so joyful, and says: <div class="bookquote">``What was your idea for asking me ?
<p/>, we can't get him (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) home for hours, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>)'s soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.
<p/>A man up and offered me ten cents to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to shove him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) along, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all over the country till we tired him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says. '' Well,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself We never got him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) till dark; then we fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) over, and I started down for the raft.
<p/>When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, `They've got into trouble and had to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and cried.
<p/>I slept in the woods all night. But what did become of the raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft.
<p/>That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) and got every cent
<p/>when I got him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, `That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>but what he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>)'d spent for whisky; and <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't shake my nigger , would I?--the only nigger I had in the world, and the only property.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) our nigger; yes, we did consider him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) so

<p/>--goodness knows we had trouble enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>). And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where's that ten cents?
<p/>I had considerable money, so I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) ten cents, but begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) to spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.
<p/>Give it here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) never said nothing. The next minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Nonesuch</b></font>) whirls on me and says: <div class="bookquote">``Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?
<p/>We'd skin him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) done that!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) blow? Hain't he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) run off?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No! That old fool sold him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), and never divided with me, and the money's gone.''
<p/>'' Sold him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)? '' I says, and begun to cry; <div class="bookquote">``why, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was my nigger, and that was my money. Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)?--I want my nigger.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, you can't get your nigger, that's all--so dry up your blubbering. Looky here --do you think you'd venture to blow on us?
<p/>Why, if you was to blow on us--'' He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) eyes before.
<p/>I went on a-whimpering, and says: <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.
<p/>Blamed if I think I'd trust you. I got to turn out and find my nigger. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) bills fluttering on his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you'll promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you where to find him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>).
<p/>You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) started to tell me the truth; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) stopped that way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) was changing his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) mind.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So I promised, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) stopped. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) was.
<p/>So pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``The man that bought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Foster</b></font>) lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Foster</b></font>) wouldn't trust me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Foster</b></font>) wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. ''
<p/>No you wont, you'll start now ; and don't you lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.
<p/>Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with us , d'ye hear?
<p/>All right,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``I can walk it in three days. And I'll start this very afternoon.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.
<p/>I wanted to be left free to work my plans. '' So clear out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to.
<p/>Maybe you can get him (<font color='blue'><b>Foster</b></font>) to believe that Jim is your nigger--some idiots don't require documents-- leastways I've heard there's such down South here.
<p/>And when you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) the handbill and the reward's bogus, maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'ll believe you when you explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) what the idea was for getting 'em out.
<p/>Go `long now, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) anything you want to; but mind you don't work your jaw any between here and there.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn't look around, but I kinder felt like he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was watching me.
<p/>I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.
<p/>I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could get away.
<p/>But I knowed I could tire him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) out at that. I didn't want no trouble with their kind. I'd seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.
<p/>WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's spirits whispering--spirits that's been dead ever so many years--and you always think they're talking about you .
<p/>CHAPTER XXXII. As a general thing it makes a body wish he (<font color='blue'><b>everybody</b></font>) was dead, too, and done with it all. Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all look alike.
<p/>; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t`other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.
<p/>A rail fence round a two-acre yard I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started for the kitchen.
<p/>When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I knowed for certain
<p/>I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone.
<p/>When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.
<p/>I wished I was dead--for that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world. And such another powwow as they made!
<p/>In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.

<p/>They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) was a sight to look at. Your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>)'s gone again, not more'n an hour ago; he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>)'ll be back any minute now. You must a met him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) on the road, didn't you?--oldish man, with a--

<p/>The old gentleman stared, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, who's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div>'' Who do you reckon 't is?'' <div class="bookquote">``I hain't no idea. Who is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But there warn't no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.
<p/>'' It's Tom Sawyer! '' By jings, I most slumped through the floor! But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like being born again
<p/>Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--
<p/>, I was so glad to find out who I was. I mean the Sawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.
<p/>And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it.
<p/>Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because they didn't know but what it would take three days to fix it.
<p/>If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well. Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty uncomfortable all up the other.
<p/>Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river.
<p/>And s`pose he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) a wink to keep quiet?
<p/>Then I says to myself, s`pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat? Well, I couldn't have it that way ; it wouldn't do at all.
<p/>I must go up the road and waylay him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>). So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage.
<p/>The old gentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and I druther he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wouldn't take no trouble about me.
<p/>SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) come along.
<p/>I says <div class="bookquote">``Hold on!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and it stopped alongside, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) swallowed two or three times like a person that's got a dry throat, and then says: <div class="bookquote">``I hain't ever done you no harm.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII. You know that. So, then, what you want to come back and ha`nt me for? ''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>I says: <div class="bookquote">``I hain't come back--I hain't been gone .
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) heard my voice it righted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) up some, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) warn't quite satisfied yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you.
<p/>Honest injun now, you ain't a ghost?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Honest injun, I ain't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says. '' Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can't somehow seem to understand it no way.
<p/>Looky here , warn't you ever murdered at all? '' '' No. I warn't ever murdered at all--I played it on them.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) done it; and it satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) was that glad to see me again he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) didn't know what to do.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) wanted to know all about it right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) lived.
<p/>But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) reckon we better do?
<p/>You come in here and feel of me if you don't believe me. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) said, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) alone a minute, and don't disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>).
<p/>Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on it's your`n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I'll go towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn't let on to know me at first.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) thought and thought, and pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``It's all right; I've got it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I says: <div class="bookquote">``All right; but wait a minute.
<p/>There's one more thing--a thing that nobody don't know but me. And that is, there's a nigger here that I'm a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) name is
<p/>Jim --old Miss Watson's Jim. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``What!

(<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.
<p/>It was the most astonishing speech I ever heard--and I'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it.
<p/>Well, then,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``joking or no joking, if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember that you don't know nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>), and I don't know nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>).

<p/>But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip.
<p/>and I drove mine. The old gentleman was at the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, this is wonderful! Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it?

He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.
<p/>only just a farmer, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation, which he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) built it himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) own expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) preaching, and it was worth it, too.
<p/>But it warn't surprising; because he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) warn't There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way, down South.

<p/>I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you--or the likes of you.'' '' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says, ``it does surprise me so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stopped and looked around slow, like he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could run across a friendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you think she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'d like me to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), sir?
<p/>I can't make it out, somehow. They said you would, and I thought you would. But-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>'' ``Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b`lieve I didn't.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looks on around the same way to me, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Tom, didn't you think Aunt Sally 'd open out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) arms and say, `Sid Sawyer--'''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My land!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) says, breaking in and jumping for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you impudent young rascal, to fool a body so--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and was going to hug him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) fended her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) off, and says: <div class="bookquote">``No, not till you've asked me first.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) didn't lose no time, but asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>); and hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) over and over again, and then turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) over to the old man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) took what was left.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And after they got a little quiet again she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.
<p/>We warn't looking for you at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) let me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to come here to the house first, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.
<p/>It's because it warn't intended for any of us to come but Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says; But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally.
<p/>This ain't no healthy place for a stranger to come. '' ``No--not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I hain't been so put out since I don't know when.
<p/>But I don't care, I don't mind the terms--I'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here.
<p/>Well, to think of that performance! I don't deny it, I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.
<p/>We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning.
<p/>Uncle Silas he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.
<p/>There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it.
<p/>But at supper, at night, one of the little boys says: <div class="bookquote">``Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>No,'' says the old man, <div class="bookquote">``I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he (<font color='blue'><b>Burton</b></font>) would tell the people; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time.
<p/>Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.
<p/>On the road Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and as they went by
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' '' So there it was!--but I couldn't help it. I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail--
<p/>though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes.
<p/>that is, I knowed it was the king and the duke, Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them
<p/>poor pitiful rascals , it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world. It was a dreadful thing to see.
<p/>We asked some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and went for them.
<p/>So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though I hadn't done nothing.
<p/>But that's always the way; it don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't got no sense, and just goes for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) anyway.
<p/>Human beings can be awful cruel to one another. We see we was too late--couldn't do no good. If I had a yaller dog that didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't no good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) says the same.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV. WE stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by Tom says: <div class="bookquote">``Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!
<p/>I bet I know where Jim is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>'' No! Where?'' <div class="bookquote">``In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What did you think the vittles was for?'' <div class="bookquote">``For a dog.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Because part of it was watermelon.'' '' So it was-- I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon.
<p/>It shows how a body can see and don't see at the same time.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) went in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) locked it again when he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) came out.
<p/>Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people's all so kind and good.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table--same key, I bet. Jim's the prisoner. All right--I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give shucks for any other way.
<p/>Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we like the best.
<p/>If I had Tom Sawyer's head I wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of.
<p/>I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>What a head for just a boy to have! Pretty soon Tom says: <div class="bookquote">``Ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' I says. '' All right--bring it out.
<p/>'' '' My plan is this,'' I says. '' We can easy find out if it's Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island.
<p/>Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man's britches after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before.
<p/>Wouldn't that plan work?'' '' Work ? Why, cert`nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it's too blame' simple; there ain't nothing to it.
<p/>What's the good of a plan that ain't no more trouble than that? It's as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.
<p/>I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) plan ready it wouldn't have none of them objections to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.
<p/>'' And it didn't. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was.
<p/>I knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got a chance.
<p/>Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
<p/>Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) family a shame, before everybody.
<p/>And that is what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) done. That was the thing that was too many for me. I couldn't understand it no way at all.
<p/>It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) so; and so be his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) true friend, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) quit the thing
<p/>And I did start to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) shut me up, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Don't you reckon I know what I'm about?
<p/>right where he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was and save himself. Don't I generly know what I'm about?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I say I was going to help steal the nigger?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well , then. '' That's all he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said, and that's all I said. It warn't no use to say any more; because when he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'d do a thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) always done it.
<p/>But I couldn't make out how he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) was willing to go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about it.
<p/>When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) was bound to have it so, I couldn't help it. We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do.
<p/>They knowed us, and didn't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night.
<p/>When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it.
<p/>I says: <div class="bookquote">``Here's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom says: <div class="bookquote">``It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky. I should hope we can find a way that's a little more complicated than that , Huck Finn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, then,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``how 'll it do to saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) out, the way I done before I was murdered that time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' That's more like ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) says. '' It's real mysterious, and troublesome, and good,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Finn</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.
<p/>Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.
<p/>There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was as long as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.
<p/>Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went to the soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took it and prized out one of the staples.
<p/>The chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.
<p/>The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever.
<p/>The door to it was at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom was joyful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``Now we're all right.
<p/>Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that
<p/>We'll dig him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) out. It 'll take about a week!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) must climb up the lightning-rod.
<p/>But after he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) got up half way about three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most busted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) brains out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>)'d got to give it up; but after he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) was rested he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) one more turn for luck, and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) made the trip.
<p/>In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it was Jim that was being fed.
<p/>The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house.
<p/>This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said the witches was pestering him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) awful these nights, and making him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) didn't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) was ever witched so long before in his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) got so worked up, and got to running on so about his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) troubles, he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) forgot all about what he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'d been a-going to do.
<p/>The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) says: ``Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.
<p/>So Tom says: <div class="bookquote">``What's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>Cur`us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at `im?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hunched Tom, and whispers: <div class="bookquote">``You going, right here in the daybreak? that warn't the plan.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>'' No, it warn't;
<p/>When we got in we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) sings out: <div class="bookquote">``Why, Huck !
<p/>but it's the plan now . ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, drat him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>), we went along, but I didn't like it much. En good lan '!
<p/>I didn't know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger busted in and says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, de gracious sakes!
<p/>ain' dat Misto Tom? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. do he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) know you genlmen?
<p/>'' We could see pretty well now. Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked at the nigger, steady and kind of wondering, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Does who know us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nigger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, dis-yer runaway nigger. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) does; but what put that into your head?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What put it dar?
<p/>Didn' he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) jis' dis minute sing out like he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) knowed you?'' Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way: <div class="bookquote">``Well, that's mighty curious.
<p/>Who sung out? when did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sing out? what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sing out? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says, <div class="bookquote">``Did you hear anybody sing out?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing ; so I says: ``No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turns to Jim, and looks him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) over like he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) before, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Did you sing out?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``No, sah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>says Jim; <div class="bookquote">``I hain't said nothing, sah. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a word?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``No, sah, I hain't said a word.
<p/>So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and says, kind of severe: <div class="bookquote">``What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the nigger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see us before?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sah; not as I knows on. ''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>What made you think somebody sung out?''
<p/>'' Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey's awluz at it, sah, en
<p/>Please to don't tell nobody `bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>)'ll scole me; `kase he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) say dey ain't no witches.
<p/>dey do mos' kill me, dey sk`yers me so. I jis' wish to goodness he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) was heah now-- den what would he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) say!
<p/>I jis' bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) couldn' fine no way to git aroun' it dis time. But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's sot , stays sot
<p/>; dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en when you fine it out en tell um `bout it, dey doan' b`lieve you.
<p/>Tom give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to buy some more thread to tie up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says: ``I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.
<p/>If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) up, I'd hang him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>).
<p/>And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) whispers to Jim and says: <div class="bookquote">``Don't ever let on to know us.
<p/>Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to; and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>'' And if you hear any digging going on nights, it's us; we're going to set you free. '' CHAPTER XXXV.
<p/>IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down into the woods; because Tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place.
<p/>We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied: <div class="bookquote">``Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.
<p/>And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain't no watchman to be drugged--now there ought to be a watchman.
<p/>And there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain.
<p/>And Uncle Silas he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger.
<p/>There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this , only there wouldn't be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) leg.
<p/>Why, drat it, Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent all the difficulties. Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can with the materials we've got.
<p/>Anyhow, there's one thing--there's more honor in getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head.
<p/>Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to let on that a lantern's resky.
<p/>Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get.
<p/>Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>'' What do we want of a saw?''
<p/>'' What do we want of it? Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed off, so as to get the chain loose?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Huck Finn/Finn/HUCK FINN</b></font>)</div>'' Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn.
<p/>Why, hain't you ever read any books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?
<p/>You can get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?
<p/>No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.
<p/>Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) goes; slip off your chain, and there you are.
<p/>Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and there's your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is.
<p/>It's gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one.
<p/>'' I says: <div class="bookquote">``What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) out from under the cabin?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) never heard me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) had forgot me and everything else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) chin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) hand, thinking.
<p/>Pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) sighs and shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) head; then sighs again, and says: <div class="bookquote">``No, it wouldn't do--there ain't necessity enough for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' For what? '' I says. '' Why, to saw Jim's leg off,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says. '' Good land! '' I says; <div class="bookquote">``why, there ain't no necessity for it.
<p/>And what would you want to saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) leg off for, anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, some of the best authorities has done it.
<p/>They couldn't get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg would be better still.
<p/>There ain't necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't understand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so we'll let it go.
<p/>But there's one thing--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) can have a rope ladder; we can tear up our sheets and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) a rope ladder easy enough.
<p/>But we got to let that go. And we can send it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) in a pie; it's mostly done that way.
<p/>And I've et worse pies. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says; <div class="bookquote">``Jim ain't got no use for a rope ladder.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) has got use for it. How you talk, you better say; you don't know nothing about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'s got to have a rope ladder; they all do.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What in the nation can he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) do with it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Do with it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) can hide it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) bed, can't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)?
<p/>Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time.
<p/>'' That's what they all do; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>)'s got to, too. S'pose he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) don't do nothing with it? ain't it there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) bed, for a clew, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>)'s gone?
<p/>and don't you reckon they'll want clews? Of course they will. And you wouldn't leave them any? That would be a pretty howdy-do, wouldn't it!
<p/>I never heard of such a thing.'' '' Well,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``if it's in the regulations, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>)'s got to have it,
<p/>all right, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) have it; because I don't wish to go back on no regulations; but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer--
<p/>if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're born.
<p/>Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ain't had no experience, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) don't care what kind of a--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep still--that's what I'D do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder?
<p/>Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my advice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.
<p/>Why, it's perfectly ridiculous.'' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said that would do. And that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) another idea, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Borrow a shirt, too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, blame it all, it ain't the prisoner's plates.''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>'' But it's somebody's plates, ain't it?'' '' Well, spos'n it is?
<p/>What does the prisoner care whose-- '' He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we cleared out for the house.
<p/>Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.
<p/>I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't borrowing, it was stealing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don't blame them for it, either.
<p/>It ain't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) warn't a prisoner.
<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for.
<p/>So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. Tom said that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) meant was, we could steal anything we needed .
<p/>Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said I didn't need it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.
<p/>So I let it go at that, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.
<p/>Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch.
<p/>By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tools? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says. '' Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``Tools for what?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, to dig with. We ain't a-going to gnaw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) out, are we?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a nigger</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with? '' I says.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Huck Finn, did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wardrobe to dig himself out with?
<p/>Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what kind of a show would that give him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to be a hero?
<p/>Why, they might as well lend him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) the key and done with it. Picks and shovels--why, they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, then,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do we want?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A couple of case-knives.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Confound it, it's foolish, Tom.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It don't make no difference
<p/>how foolish it is, it's the right way--and it's the regular way. And there ain't no other way , that ever I heard of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these things.
<p/>They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind you; generly it's through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever.
<p/>Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Thirty-seven year --and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) come out in China. That's the kind. I wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock.''
<p/>'' Jim don't know nobody in China. '' '' What's that got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow.
<p/>But you're always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can't you stick to the main point?'' '' All right--I don't care where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes out, so he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes out; and Jim don't, either, I reckon.
<p/>But there's one thing, anyway--Jim's too old to be dug out with a case-knife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) won't last. '' '' Yes he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) will last , too.
<p/>You don't reckon it's going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a dirt foundation, do you?'' <div class="bookquote">``How long will it take, Tom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>)'ll hear Jim ain't from there. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can't resk being as long digging him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) out as we ought to.
<p/>Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can let on , to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years.
<p/>By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can't. Then we can snatch him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) out and rush him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) away the first time there's an alarm.
<p/>Letting on don't cost nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.
<p/>Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way.'' <div class="bookquote">``Now, there's sense in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says. '' It wouldn't strain me none, after I got my hand in.
<p/>So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.'' '' Smouch three,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``we want one to make a saw out of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says: <div class="bookquote">``It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.
<p/>Run along and smouch the knives--three of them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>So I done it. CHAPTER XXXVI. AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep
<p/>that night we went down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work.
<p/>Tom said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin
<p/>ever know there was any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.
<p/>So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly.
<p/>We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. At last I says: <div class="bookquote">``This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) sighed, and pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) was thinking.
<p/>If we was prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn't get but
<p/>a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) never said nothing. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. But we can't fool along; we got to rush; we ain't got no time to spare.
<p/>If we was to put in another night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well--couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner.
<p/>It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you. : we got to dig him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) out with the picks, and let on it's case-knives.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Now you're talking ! '' I says; <div class="bookquote">``your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says.
<p/>Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.
<p/>When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done
<p/>What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.
<p/>'' so it's done. '' '' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn't
<p/>so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) ain't ignorant and knows better.
<p/>It might answer for you to dig Jim out with a pick, without any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it wouldn't for me, because I do know better.
<p/>Gimme a case-knife. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) own by him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), but I handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) flung it down, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Gimme a case-knife .
<p/>I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) took it and went to work, and never said a word.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was always just that particular. Full of principle. So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly.
<p/>We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it.
<p/>When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) level best with the lightning-rod, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't come it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands was so sore.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``It ain't no use, it can't be done. What you reckon I better do? Can't you think of no way?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``but I reckon it ain't regular. Come up the stairs, and let on it's a lightning-rod. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates.
<p/>Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could use them over again.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) done it. So Tom was satisfied. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) went to studying.
<p/>By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to decide on any of them yet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take them in through the hole,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says, <div class="bookquote">``when we get it done. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Said we'd got to post Jim first.
<p/>That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done.
<p/>We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) up gentle and gradual.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was so glad to see us he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time.
<p/>But Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) how unregular it would be, and set down and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got away, sure .
<p/>So Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and
<p/>when Jim told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and Aunt Sally come in to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says: '' Now I know how to fix it.
<p/>I said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never paid no attention to me; went right on.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) must be on the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) open them; and we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) must steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) what they would be and what they was for.
<p/>We'll send you some things by them. '' It was his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) way when he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'d got his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) plans set. And told him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) how to keep a journal on the shirt with his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) blood, and all that.
<p/>Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) couldn't see no sense in the most of it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>); so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was satisfied, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would do it all just as Tom said.
<p/>Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said it was the best fun he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ever had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) life, and the most intellectural; and said if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) only could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got used to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) everything. Tom was in high spirits. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.
<p/>In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked better.
<p/>but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into bread, you know; but after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) never bit into nothing but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) jabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) fork into it in three or four places first.
<p/>And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room in there to get your breath.
<p/>Tom said so himself. Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) never let on By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to door! The nigger Nat
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) only just hollered <div class="bookquote">``Witches''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>once, and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) was dying.
<p/>Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was out himself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d fixed the other door too.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) went to work on the nigger, coaxing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) and petting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d been imagining he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) saw something again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) raised up, and blinked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) eyes around, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b`lieve I see most a million dogs, er devils, er
<p/>some`n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks. I did, mos' sholy. Mars Sid, I felt um-- I felt um, sah; dey was all over me.
<p/>Dad fetch it , I jis' wisht I could git my han's on one er dem witches jis' wunst-- on'y jis' wunst--it's all I'd ast.
<p/>But mos`ly I wisht dey'd lemme `lone, I does. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Tom says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger's breakfast-time?
<p/>It's because they're hungry; that's the reason. You make them a witch pie; that's the thing for you to do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>But my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie? I doan' know how to make it.
<p/>I hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b`fo'.'' '' Well, then, I'll have to make it myself.'' <div class="bookquote">``Will you do it, honey?--will you?
<p/>I'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot, I will!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger.
<p/>When we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we've put in the pan, don't you let on you see it at all.
<p/>But you got to be mighty careful. And don't you look when Jim unloads the pan--something might happen, I don't know what.
<p/>And above all, don't you handle the witch-things.'' '' Hannel 'M , Mars Sid? What is you a-talkin' `bout? I wouldn' lay de weight er my finger on um, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars, I wouldn't.
<p/>So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t`other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come yet, so we had to wait a little while.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) come she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was hot and red and cross, and couldn't hardly wait for the blessing; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child's head with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) thimble with the other, and says: <div class="bookquote">``I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what has become of your other shirt.
<p/>My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the children in the eye and curled him (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) the size of a warwhoop,
<p/>and Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned kinder blue around the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder.
<p/>But after that we was all right again--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXXVII. THAT was all fixed. '' Uncle Silas he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it. I know
<p/>perfectly well I took it off , because-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because you hain't got but one on . Just listen at the man!

<p/>But it's gone, that's the long and the short of it, and you'll just have to change to a red flann'l one till I can get time to make a new one.
<p/>It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to do with 'm
<p/>And it 'll be the third I've made in two years. all is more'n I can make out. A body 'd think you would learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life.
<p/>But it oughtn't to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believe I've ever lost one of them off of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Silas/Uncle Silas</b></font>)</div>Well, it ain't your fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done it if you could, I reckon.
<p/>And the shirt ain't all that's gone, nuther. Ther's a spoon gone; and that ain't all. There was ten, and now ther's only nine.
<p/>The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, that's certain. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, what else is gone, Sally?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The rats could a got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk off with the whole place, the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't do it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair,
<p/>'' Ther's six candles gone--that's what. Silas-- you'd never find it out; but you can't lay the spoon on the rats, and that I know.
<p/>'' '' Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been remiss; but I won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.
<p/>'' '' Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta Phelps! '' Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any.
<p/>Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Missus, dey's a sheet gone. ''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A sheet gone!

<p/>I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>) kept a-raging right along, running her (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>) insurrection all by herself, and everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>) stopped, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>) mouth open and her (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>) hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in Jeruslem or somewheres.
<p/>So you had it in your pocket all the time; and like as not you've got the other things there, too.
<p/>But not long, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Missus</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``It's just as I expected. How'd it get there?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I reely don't know, Sally,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) says, kind of apologizing, ``or you know I would tell.
<p/>I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; but I'll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know I didn't put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon, and--
<p/>Go `long now, the whole kit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till I've got back my peace of mind.
<p/>if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it out; and I'd a got up and obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) if I'd a been dead.
<p/>As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.
<p/>Tom see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says: ``Well, it ain't no use to send things by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) no more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ain't reliable.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) done us a good turn with the spoon, anyway, without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) one without him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knowing it--stop up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rat-holes.
<p/>There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.
<p/>Then we heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t`other, looking as absent-minded as year before last.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, for the land's sake! Give a body a rest! '' I'D a heard her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d been to them all.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) candle and thinking. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Well, for the life of me
<p/>I can't remember when I done it. I could show her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats.
<p/>But never mind--let it go. I reckon it wouldn't do no good. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.
<p/>Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said we'd got to have it; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took a think.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had ciphered it out he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons yet .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a mighty nice old man. And always is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Go `long to your play, and don't bother me.
<p/>I know better, I counted 'm myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine. ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) looked out of all patience, but of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) come to count--anybody would. '' I declare to gracious ther' ain't but nine!
<p/>So I slipped back the one I had, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) got done counting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's ten now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) looked huffy and bothered both.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) says. '' Why, what in the world--plague take the things, I'll count 'm again. '' But Tom says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You numskull, didn't you see me count 'm? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know, but-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I'll count 'm again . ''
<p/>So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was so mad.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) said cle'r out and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) have some peace, and if we come bothering around her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) again betwixt that and dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d skin us.
<p/>So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) apron-pocket whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) shingle nail, before noon.
<p/>We was very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) life; and wouldn't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d counted them right if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) did ; and said that after she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d about counted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) head off for the next three days he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) judged she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) to ever count them any more.
<p/>So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) didn't know how many sheets she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) had any more, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) didn't care , and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) life
<p/>So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) counted and counted till she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) got that addled ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) druther die first. no consequence, it would blow over by and by.
<p/>We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we couldn't prop it up right, and she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) would always cave in.
<p/>But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. But of course we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too, in the pie.
<p/>So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with.
<p/>We let on it took nine months to make it. And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go into the pie.
<p/>Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.
<p/>We could a had a whole dinner. But we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and so we throwed the rest away.
<p/>We didn't cook none of the pies in the wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) had a noble brass warming-pan which he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) thought considerable of, because it belonged to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up
<p/>garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they warn't
<p/>but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) out, private, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) down there, but she (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) failed on the first pies, because we didn't know how, but she (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) come up smiling on the last one.
<p/>We took and lined her (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) with dough, and set her (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) in the coals, and loaded her (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at.
<p/>But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp him (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) down to business
<p/>I don't know nothing what I'm talking about, and lay him (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) in enough stomach-ache to last him (<font color='blue'><b>ancesters</b></font>) till next time, too.
<p/>Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was by himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) straw tick, and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole.
<p/>MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had to have it; Tom said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d got to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) inscription to leave behind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) coat of arms.
<p/>, CHAPTER XXXVIII. That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. '' Look at Lady Jane Grey,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) says; ``look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland!
<p/>Why, Huck, s`pose it is considerble trouble?--what you going to do?--how you going to get around it? Jim's got to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) inscription and coat of arms.
<p/>Jim says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>They all do. '' '' Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different. '' '' Well,'' I says, ``Jim's right, anyway, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ain't got no coat of arms, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hain't.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I reckon I knowed that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>Tom says, ``but you bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll have one before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) goes out of this--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s going out right , and there ain't going to be no flaws in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) record.
<p/>So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms.
<p/>By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d struck so many good ones he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't hardly know which to take, but there was one which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d decide on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``On the scutcheon we'll have a bend or in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure , with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable , with his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) bundle over his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, Maggiore Fretta, Minore Otto.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' Got it out of a book--means the more haste the less speed.'' <div class="bookquote">``Geewhillikins,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says, <div class="bookquote">``but what does the rest of it mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We ain't got no time to bother over that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``we got to dig in like all git-out.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Well, anyway,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``what's some of it?
<p/>What's a fess?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' A fess--a fess is-- you don't need to know what a fess is. I'll show him (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>) how to make it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Otto</b></font>) gets to it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shucks, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says, <div class="bookquote">``I think you might tell a person. What's a bar sinister?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, I don't know. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s got to have it.
<p/>All the nobility does. '' That was just his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way. If it didn't suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to explain a thing to you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wouldn't do it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done.
<p/>You might pump at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) a week, it wouldn't make no difference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so
<p/>: 1. Here a captive heart busted. 2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) sorrowful life.
<p/>3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity. 4.
<p/>Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV. Tom's voice trembled whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was reading them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) most broke down.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got done he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't no way make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) scrabble them all on.
<p/>Jim said it would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) didn't know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would block them out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the lines.
<p/>Then pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.
<p/>Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said it would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wouldn't ever get out.
<p/>We'll fetch a rock. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But Tom said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would let me help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) do it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens.
<p/>It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says: <div class="bookquote">``I know how to fix it.
<p/>We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.
<p/>There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it.
<p/>It warn't quite midnight yet , so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) home, but it was a most nation tough job.
<p/>Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) from falling over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) come mighty near mashing us every time.
<p/>Tom said she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through. We got her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) half way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) raised up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) along like nothing; and Tom superintended.
<p/>We see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could out-superintend any boy I ever see.
<p/>Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone through; but Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) took the pick and soon made it big enough.
<p/>Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to work till the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) candle quit on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) straw tick and sleep on it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) knowed how to do everything. Then we helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.
<p/>But Tom thought of something, and says: <div class="bookquote">``You got any spiders in here, Jim?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't
<p/>, Mars Tom. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' All right, we'll get you some.'' '' But bless you, honey, I doan' want none. I's afeard un um.
<p/>I jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'. '' Tom thought a minute or two, and says: <div class="bookquote">``It's a good idea. And I reckon it's been done.
<p/>It must a been done; it stands to reason. Yes, it's a prime good idea. Where could you keep it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Keep what, Mars Tom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, a rattlesnake. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mars Tom</b></font>)</div>'' De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah
<p/>I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little.
<p/>You could tame it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Tame it!'' '' Yes--easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting, and they wouldn't think of hurting a person that pets them.
<p/>Why, you can get him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) so, in a little while, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'ll love you; and sleep with you; and won't stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) round your neck and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) head in your mouth.''
<p/>Any book will tell you that. You try--that's all I ask; just try for two or three days. '' Please , Mars Tom-- doan ' talk so!
<p/>I can't stan ' it! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d let me shove his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain't it? I lay he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d wait a pow`ful long time `fo' I ast him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>A prisoner's got to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life.
<p/>En mo' en dat, I doan' want him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to sleep wid me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Jim, don't act so foolish. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mars Tom, I doan' want no sich glory.

<p/>So don't make no more fuss about it. Prisoners ain't ever without rats. There ain't no instance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.
<p/>But you got to play music to them. You got anything to play music on?'' <div class="bookquote">``I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice-harp; but

<p/>A jews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music--in a prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can't get no other kind out of a jews-harp.
<p/>It always interests them; they come out to see what's the matter with you. Yes, you're all right; you're fixed very well.
<p/>You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play '
<p/>quicker 'n anything else; and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come.
<p/>The Last Link is Broken'--that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.
<p/>'' '' Yes, dey will, I reck`n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is Jim havin'? Blest if I kin see de pint.
<p/>But I'll do it ef I got to. I reck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.
<p/>Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else; and pretty soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, there's one thing I forgot.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?'' <div class="bookquote">``I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah, en

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you believe it. We'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) studied it over, and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could with an onion.
<p/>Jim said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``jis' 's soon have tobacker in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) coffee;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>So Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was sorry, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) promised he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's coffee-pot, in the morning. CHAPTER XXXIX.
<p/>IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed.
<p/>little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) come in, and when we got back she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>).
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.
<p/>But while we was gone for spiders I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.
<p/>We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's nest, but we didn't.
<p/>We didn't give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd tire them out
<p/>The family was at home. or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near
<p/>And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day's work: and hungry?--oh, no,
<p/>all right again, but couldn't set down convenient. I reckon not! And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn't half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.
<p/>But it didn't matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again.
<p/>You'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want them.
<p/>Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>), it didn't make no difference what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was doing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) would just lay that work down and light out.
<p/>No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. I never see such a woman.
<p/>And you could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whoop to Jericho. You couldn't get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.
<p/>And if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned over and found one in bed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire.
<p/>Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally
<p/>warn't over it yet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) warn't near over it; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was setting thinking about something you could touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) neck with a feather
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) disturbed the old man so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created. and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) would jump right out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) stockings.
<p/>It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said they was made that way for some reason or other.
<p/>We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them.
<p/>I didn't mind the lickings, because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot.
<p/>But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>Jim didn't like the spiders, and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and make it mighty warm for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), skasely; and when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said, because they never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch,
<p/>so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) always had one gang under him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) way, and t`other gang having a circus over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) crossed over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ever got out this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary. Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.
<p/>The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would get up and write a little in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.
<p/>We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn't. It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same.
<p/>But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.
<p/>The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such plantation; so he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) allowed he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose.
<p/>So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters. '' What's them? '' I says. '' Warnings to the people that something is up.
<p/>Sometimes it's done one way, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle.
<p/>When Louis XVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it. It's a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters.
<p/>And it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stays in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) slides out in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) clothes.
<p/>We'll use them both. We'll do that, too.'' '' But looky here, Tom, what do we want to warn anybody for that something's up?
<p/>Let them find it out for themselves--it's their lookout. '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. It's the way they've acted from the very start--left us to do everything .
<p/>So if we don't give them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing--won't be nothing to it.
<p/>They're so confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shucks! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says, and looked disgusted. So I says: <div class="bookquote">``But I ain't going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you suits me.
<p/>What you going to do about the servant-girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``You'll be her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>). You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that yaller girl's frock.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prob`bly hain't got any but that one.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs. '' <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't look like a servant-girl then , would you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, anyway .'' <div class="bookquote">``That ain't got nothing to do with it.
<p/>The thing for us to do is just to do our duty , and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not.
<p/>Hain't you got no principle at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl. Who's Jim's mother?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mother.
<p/>I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.''
<p/>I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) bed to represent his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much. When a prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion. It's always called so when a king escapes, f`rinstance.
<p/>And the same with a king's son; it don't make no difference whether he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s a natural one or an unnatural one.
<p/>So Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the way Tom told me to.
<p/>Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It said: Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. Unknown Friend . I never see a family in such a sweat.
<p/>They couldn't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.
<p/>If a door banged, Aunt Sally she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) jumped and said <div class="bookquote">``ouch!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>if anything fell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) jumped and said <div class="bookquote">``ouch!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>if you happened to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) warn't noticing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) done the same; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) couldn't face noway and be satisfied, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) allowed there was something behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) every time--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying <div class="bookquote">``ouch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d got two-thirds around
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d whirl back again, and say it again; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was afraid to go to bed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) dasn't set up.
<p/>So the thing was working very well , Tom said; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never see a thing work more satisfactory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said it showed it was done right.
<p/>So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.
<p/>Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) stuck it in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) neck and come back.
<p/>There is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them.
<p/>I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and will betray the helish design.
<p/>They will sneak down from northards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger's cabin to get him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>).
<p/>I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will baa like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all
<p/>; then whilst they are getting his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) said, now for the grand bulge! This letter said: Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend. Don't do anything
<p/>but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing.
<p/>WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a look at the raft and found her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) all right, and got home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stole and was going to start with the lunch, but says: <div class="bookquote">``Where's the butter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Unknown Friend. CHAPTER XL. <div class="bookquote">``I laid out a hunk of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says, <div class="bookquote">``on a piece of a corn-pone.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, you left it laid out, then--
<p/>it ain't here.'' <div class="bookquote">``We can get along without it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says. '' We can get along with it, too,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) says; ``just you slide down cellar and fetch it.
<p/>I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mother in disguise, and be ready to baa like a sheep and shove soon as you get there.
<p/>The hunk of butter, big as a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) see me; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``You been down cellar?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along. '' So out he (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) went, and down cellar went I. <div class="bookquote">``Yes'm.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What you been doing down there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Noth`n.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Noth`n! '' <div class="bookquote">``No'm.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know 'm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``You don't know ? Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what you been doing down there.
<p/>I reckoned she (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>)'d let me go now, and as a generl thing she (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) would; but I s`pose there was so many strange things going on
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she (<font color='blue'><b>I.</b></font>) says, very decided: <div class="bookquote">``You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.
<p/>You been up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it is before I'M done with you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I have. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.
<p/>My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.
<p/>They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their buttons.
<p/>I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest
<p/>we'd got ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us.
<p/>I warn't easy myself, but I didn't take my hat off, all the same. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) come and begun to ask me questions, but I couldn't answer them straight
<p/>, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't
<p/>but a few minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks
<p/>I was that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, <div class="bookquote">``I'M for going and getting in the cabin first and right now , and catching them when they come,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says: ``For the land's sake, what is the matter with the child?
<p/>And everybody runs to see, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) snatches off my hat, and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) grabbed me, and hugged me, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a turn you did give me!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s got the brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out! ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and how glad and grateful I am it
<p/>ain't no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by the color and
<p/>all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear, dear, whyd`nt you tell me that was what you'd been down there for, I wouldn't a cared.
<p/>I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.
<p/>I couldn't hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder, with guns!
<p/>Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of you till morning! '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes just blazed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``No!--is that so?
<p/>ain't it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hurry! Hurry ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says. '' Where's Jim?'' '' Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say: <div class="bookquote">``I told you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.
<p/>Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear 'em coming.
<p/>So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s dressed, and everything's ready. Now we'll slide out and give the sheep-signal. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>'' But we got under all right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--
<p/>Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders. Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.
<p/>So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eye to the crack, but couldn't make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would listen for the steps to get further, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nudged us Jim must glide out first, and him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) last.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ear to the crack and listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time; and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it;
<p/>but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hear the steps coming, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out: <div class="bookquote">``Who's that?
<p/>Answer, or I'll shoot! ''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there was a rush, and a Bang, Bang, Bang! and the bullets fairly whizzed around us!
<p/>We heard them sing out: <div class="bookquote">``Here they are! They've broke for the river! After 'em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell.
<p/>We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them.
<p/>They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to.
<p/>Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.
<p/>And when we stepped on to the raft I says: '' Now , old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a slave no more.''
<p/>'' En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It `uz planned beautiful, en it `uz done beautiful; en dey ain't nobody kin git up
<p/>We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a bullet in the calf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) leg.
<p/>a plan dat's mo' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz. '' When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before.
<p/>It was hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.
<p/>Don't stop now; don't fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set her (<font color='blue'><b>duke</b></font>) loose!
<p/>, there wouldn't a been no `Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!' wrote down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) biography; no, sir, we'd a whooped him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) over the border
<p/>Boys, we done it elegant!--`deed we did. I wish we'd a had the handling of Louis XVI . --that's what we'd
<p/>a done with him (<font color='blue'><b>XVI</b></font>) --and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too. Man the sweeps--man the sweeps! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking. And after we'd thought a minute, I says: <div class="bookquote">``Say it, Jim. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.
<p/>dat `uz bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) say, `Go on en save me, nemmine `bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?'
<p/>Ef it wuz him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) say dat? You bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) wouldn't! well , den, is Jim gywne to say it?
<p/>I knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was white inside, and I reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)'d say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) did say--so it was all right now, and
<p/>No, sah --I doan' budge a step out'n dis place `dout a doctor , not if it's forty year! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>So when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) sees me getting the canoe ready, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village.
<p/>Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full of gold in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand, and then take and lead him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) and take his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) chalk away from him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and don't give it back to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) till you get him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) back to the village, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will chalk this raft so he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) can find it again.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) give us a piece of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mind, but it didn't do no good. It's the way they all do.
<p/>So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) see the doctor coming till he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was gone again.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must a kicked his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) dreams, for it went off and shot him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) in the leg, and we wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XLI. THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up. ''
<p/>Who is your folks? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says. '' The Phelpses, down yonder. '' '' Oh,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says. And after a minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``How'd you say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got shot?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a dream,'' I says, <div class="bookquote">``and it shot him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Singular dream,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says. So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lit up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lantern, and got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saddle-bags, and we started.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees the canoe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't like the look of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--said she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was big enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two.
<p/>I says: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried the three of us easy enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' What three?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, me and Sid, and--and--and the guns ; that's what I mean.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) foot on the gunnel and rocked her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) head, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>)'d look around for a bigger one.
<p/>But they was all locked and chained; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) says. But I said I didn't; so I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) just how to find the raft, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) started.
<p/>I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos'n he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is?
<p/>spos'n it takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) three or four days? What are we going to do?--lay around there till he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) lets the cat out of the bag?
<p/>No, sir; I know what I'll do. I'll wait, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) comes back if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>)'s got to go any more
<p/>I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>), and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>), and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) we'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) get ashore.
<p/>So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head!
<p/>I shot out and went for the doctor's house, but they told me he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'d gone away in the night some time or other, and warn't back yet.
<p/>Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off. So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's stomach!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, Tom! Where you been all this time, you rascal?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hain't been nowheres,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says, <div class="bookquote">``only just hunting for the runaway nigger--me and Sid.

<p/>We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we're going home.
<p/>the old man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got a letter out of the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) got done fooling around--but we would ride.
<p/>I couldn't get him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) said there warn't no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.
<p/>When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) laughed and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't amount to shucks, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d serve Sid the same when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) come.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head around slow, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eye lit on me--I got up and took a walk.
<p/>Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.
<p/>And when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the noise and shooting waked up me and <div class="bookquote">``Sid,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try that no more.
<p/>And then I went on and told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) all what I told Uncle Silas before; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'d forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn't come of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) judged she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) better put in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) time being grateful
<p/>So I done it. But I dasn't go fur, or she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'d a sent for me. we was alive and well and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had us still,
<p/>So then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says: ``Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet!
<p/>I see my chance; so I skips up and says: <div class="bookquote">``I'll run right up to town and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I says.
<p/>stead of fretting over what was past and done. What has become of that boy? '' '' No you won't,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) says.
<p/>'' You'll stay right wher' you are; one's enough to be lost at a time. If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll go.
<p/>'' Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's track.
<p/>Aunt Sally was a good deal uneasy; but Uncle Silas he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) said there warn't no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) said, and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'d set up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) could see it.
<p/>And then when I went up to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) come up with me and fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good
<p/>and like I couldn't look her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) in the face; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) set down on the bed and talked with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) had to be satisfied. I felt mean, Sid was, and didn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>); and kept asking me every now
<p/>and then if I reckoned he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) not by him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>), and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) good, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was in so much trouble.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was going away she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says: <div class="bookquote">``The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and the rod; but you'll be good, won't you?
<p/>Laws knows I wanted to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all intending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.
<p/>And you won't go? For my sake. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was on my mind and Tom was on my mind , so I slept very restless.
<p/>And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front, and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) setting there by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) candle in the window with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>), but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never do nothing to grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) any more.
<p/>And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was there yet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) candle was most out, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) old gray head was resting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was asleep.
<p/>THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything.
<p/>CHAPTER XLII. And by and by the old man says: <div class="bookquote">``Did I give you the letter? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.''
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rummaged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets, and then went off somewheres where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' No, you didn't give me no letter. '' '' Well, I must a forgot it. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, it's from St. Petersburg--it's from Sis.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir. But before she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could break it open she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dropped it and run--for she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) see something.
<p/>I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) calico dress, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hands tied behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>); and a lot of people.
<p/>And so did I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flung herself at Tom, crying, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s dead, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s dead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div><p/>And Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head a little, and muttered something or other, which showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) warn't in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) right mind; then she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flung up her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and says: ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s alive, thank God!
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snatched a kiss of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue could go, every jump of the way.
<p/>I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.
<p/>The men was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights.
<p/>But the others said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ain't our nigger, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) owner would turn up and make us pay for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), sure.
<p/>So that cooled them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) when they've got their satisfaction out of him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>).
<p/>They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) a cuff or two side the head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) never let on to know me, and they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to the same cabin, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) own clothes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), and chained him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hands, too, and both legs, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) owner come, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was sold at auction because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Don't be no rougher on him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) than you're obleeged to, because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ain't a bad nigger.
<p/>When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut the bullet out without some help, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) warn't in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, and wouldn't let me come a-nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) any more, and said if I chalked his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) raft he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do anything at all with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
<p/>; so I says, I got to have help somehow; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'ll help, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) done it, too, and done it very well.
<p/>And that's enough! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>Of course I judged he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) must be a runaway nigger, and there I was ! and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.
<p/>I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but
<p/>I dasn't, because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.
<p/>So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) was risking his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'d been worked main hard lately.
<p/>I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too.
<p/>I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I was , with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning
<p/>; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) head propped on his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) and grabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) and tied him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) knowed what he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) was about, and we never had no trouble.
<p/>And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start.
<p/>It was a fix, I tell you! He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I think about him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>). '' Somebody says: <div class="bookquote">``Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say.
<p/>Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), too; because I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had a good heart in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) and was a good man the first time I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Somebody</b></font>)</div>So every one of them promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) no more. Then they come out and locked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) up.
<p/>I hoped they was going to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) bread and water; but they didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.
<p/>Aunt Sally she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) stuck to the sick-room all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>).
<p/>Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap.
<p/>But I had plenty time. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) come. So I set down and laid for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to wake.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d been sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d wake up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) right mind.
<p/>So we set there watching, and by and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stirs a bit, and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Hello!--why, I'm at home !
<p/>In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump again! How's that? Where's the raft?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It's all right,'' I says. '' And Jim ?'' '' The same,'' I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) never noticed, but says: <div class="bookquote">``Good! Splendid! Now we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?

''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What whole thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, the whole thing. There ain't but one
<p/>; how we set the runaway nigger free--me and Tom. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good land! Set the run--What is the child talking about!
<p/>Dear, dear, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head again!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No , I ain't out of my head ; I know all what I'm talking about.
<p/>We did set him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) free--me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we done it. And we done it elegant, too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d got a start, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never checked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up, just set and stared and stared, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) clip along, and I see it warn't
<p/>'' no use for me to put in. '' Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep.
<p/>And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can't think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think half the fun it was.
<p/>And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket--
<p/>''--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't
<p/>interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and wasn't it bully, Aunty!''
<p/>So it was you , you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble, and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Mercy sakes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out
<p/>o' you this very minute. To think, here I've been, night after night, a-- you just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old Harry out
<p/>But Tom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was so proud and joyful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) just couldn't hold in, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tongue just went it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says: '' Well , you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now , for mind
<p/>o' both o' ye!'' I tell you if I catch you meddling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) again-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Meddling with who ?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Tom says, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) smile and looking surprised.
<p/>'' With who ? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who'd you reckon? '' Tom looks at me very grave, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Tom, didn't you just tell me he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was all right?
<p/>They've got him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back, safe and sound, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s in that cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s claimed or sold!
<p/>Tom rose square up in bed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eye hot, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:
<p/>Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got away?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ?'' says Aunt Sally; <div class="bookquote">``the runaway nigger? ' Deed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hasn't. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sally/Aunt Sally</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They hain't no right to shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up!
<p/>SHOVE!--and don't you lose a minute. Turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) loose! he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ain't no slave; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s as free as any cretur that walks this earth!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does the child mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I mean every word I say , Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, I'll go.
<p/>Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) was ashamed she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) ever was going to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) down the river, and said so; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) free in her (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) will.''
<p/>I've knowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life, and so has Tom, there. <div class="bookquote">``Then what on earth did you want to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) free for, seeing he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was already free?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, that is a question, I must say; and just like women! Why, I wanted the adventure of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in blood to--goodness alive, Aunt Polly!
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!
<p/>Aunt Sally jumped for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>), and most hugged the head off of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>), and cried over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>), and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.
<p/>And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) spectacles--kind of grinding him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) into the earth, you know.
<p/>'' And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you better turn y'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, deary me!'' says Aunt Sally; '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) changed so?
<p/>Why, that ain't Tom , it's Sid; Tom's--Tom's-- why, where is Tom? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was here a minute ago. '' '' You mean where's Huck Finn
<p/>I reckon I hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) when I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>--that's what you mean! That would be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn. '' So I done it.
<p/>Aunt Sally she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) come in and they told it all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>).
<p/>It kind of made him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) drunk, as you may say, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it.
<p/>So Tom's Aunt Polly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer--she (<font color='blue'><b>Phelps</b></font>) chipped in and says, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it now, and `tain't no need to change'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer
<p/>and I knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>), being a mystery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>)'d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied.
<p/>And so it turned out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sawyer</b></font>) let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) could for me.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Sid</b></font>) Aunt Polly she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free!
<p/>and I couldn't ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) could help a body set a nigger free with his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) bringing-up.
<p/>Well, Aunt Polly she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) that Tom and Sid had come all right and safe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) says to herself:
<p/>But not feeling brash. I had to stand it--there warn't no other way, <div class="bookquote">``Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) go off that way without anybody to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur's up to this time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, I never heard nothing from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>says Aunt Sally. '' Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here.''
<p/>'' Well, I never got 'em, Sis. '' Aunt Polly she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) turns around slow and severe, and says: <div class="bookquote">``You, Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well-- what ?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says, kind of pettish. '' Don't you what me , you impudent thing--hand out them letters. '' <div class="bookquote">``What letters?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Them letters. I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll-- '' '' They're in the trunk.
<p/>There, now. And they're just the same as they was when I got them out of the office. I hain't looked into them, I hain't touched them.
<p/>But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought if you warn't in no hurry, I'd-- '' '' Well, you do need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it.
<p/>And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s`pose he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)-- '' '' No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but it's all right, I've got that one.
<p/>I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hadn't, but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to.
<p/>'' So I never said nothing. CHAPTER THE LAST THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) idea, time of the evasion?--what
<p/>it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'d planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had planned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) being free, and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would be a hero, and so would we.
<p/>We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he (<font color='blue'><b>Silas</b></font>) helped the doctor nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up prime, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.
<p/>And we had him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says: <div class="bookquote">``Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what
<p/>But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was. I tell you up dah on Jackson islan'? I tole you
<p/>I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it ; en I tole you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich agin ; en it's come true; en heah
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is! dah , now! doan' talk to me --signs is signs , mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well `at
<p/>And then Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get none from home, because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.
<p/>I `uz gwineter be rich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>'' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thatcher</b></font>) hain't, '' Tom says; <div class="bookquote">``it's all there yet--six thousand dollars and more; and your pap hain't ever been back since.
<p/>Hadn't when I come away, anyhow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>Jim says, kind of solemn: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Tom/Tom Sawyer</b></font>)</div>I says: <div class="bookquote">``Why, Jim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I kept at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>); so at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) says: ``Doan' you `member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nemmine why, Huck--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) ain't comin' back no mo. ''  (<font color='red'><b>member</b></font>)</div>a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Huck</b></font>) and didn' let you come in?
<p/>Tom's most well now, and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bullet around his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck on a watch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and ain't a-going to no more.
<p/>Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase dat wuz him (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>). '' But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before. THE END. YOURS TRULY, HUCK FINN .
