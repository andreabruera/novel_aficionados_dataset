the missouri negro dialect the extremest form of the backwoods southwestern dialect the ordinary pike county dialect and four modified varieties of this last
the shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion or by guesswork but painstakingly and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech
i make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding
out of bondage jim_tom_sawyer liberality yours truly explanatory in this book a number of dialects are used to wit the author
chapter i you dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of jim_tom_sawyer but that aint no matter
huckleberry huck_finn scene the mississippi valley time forty to fifty year ago that book was made by mr mark twain and he told the truth mainly
i never seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was aunt polly or the widow or maybe miss_mary_jane
jim_tom_sawyer aunt polly she is and miss_mary_jane and the widow douglas is all told about in that book which is mostly a true book with some stretchers as i said before
there was thing which he stretched but mainly he told the truth that is nothing aunt polly now the way that the book winds up is this
jim_tom_sawyer and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich we got six thousand dollar apiece all gold
well judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round more than a body could tell what to do with
the widow douglas she took me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her way and so when i couldnt stand it no longer i lit out
it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up i got into my old rags and my sugar hogshead again and was free and satisfied
but jim_tom_sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable
the widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she called me a lot of other name too but she never meant no harm by it
she put me in them new clothe again and i couldnt do nothing but sweat and sweat and feel all cramped up
so i went back well then the old thing commenced again the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time
when you got to the table you couldnt go right to eating but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals though there warnt really anything the matter with them that is nothing only everything was cooked by itself
in a barrel of odds and ends it is different thing get mixed up and the juice kind of swaps around and the thing go better
after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time so then i didnt care no more about him because i dont take no stock in dead people
pretty soon i wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me but she wouldnt she said it was a mean practice and wasnt clean and i must try to not do it any more
that is just the way with some people they get down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it
here she was a bothering about moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it
her sister miss_watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a spelling book
and she took snuff too of course that was all right because she done it herself she worked me middling hard for about an hour and then the widow made her ease up
miss_watson would say dont put your foot up there huckleberry and dont scrunch up like that huckleberry set up straight and pretty soon she would say dont gap and stretch like that huckleberry why dont you try to behave
i couldnt stood it much longer then for an hour it was deadly dull and i was fidgety then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wished i was there
she got mad then but i didnt mean no harm all i wanted was to go somewheres all i wanted was a change
she said it was wicked to say what i said said she wouldnt say it for the whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place
i warnt particular well i couldnt see no advantage in going where she was going so i made up my mind
i wouldnt try for it but i never said so because it would only make trouble and wouldnt do no good
she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing forever and ever
now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good place so i didnt think much of it
but i never said so i asked her if she reckoned jim_tom_sawyer would go there and she said not by a considerable sight
i was glad about that because i wanted him and me to be together miss_watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome
by and by they fetched the nigger in and had prayers and then everybody was off to bed i went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table
then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful but it warnt no use
the stars were shining and the leaves rustled in the wood ever so mournful and i heard an owl away off who whooing about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die and the wind was trying to whisper something to me and i couldnt make out what it was
i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead and so it made the cold shivers run over me then away out in the wood
i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that on its mind and cant make itself understood and so cant rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving
pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder and i flipped it off and it lit in the candle and before i could budge it was all shriveled up
i didnt need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i was scared and most shook the clothe off of me
i got up and turned around in my tracks three time and crossed my breast every time and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away
you do that when you ve lost a horseshoe that you ve found instead of nailing it up over the door but i hadnt ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you killed a spider
i set down again a shaking all over and got out my pipe for a smoke for the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldnt know
well after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boom boom boom twelve licks and all still again stiller than ever
i got so down hearted and scared i did wish i had some company but i hadnt no confidence pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the tree something was a stirring
i set still and listened directly i could just barely hear a me yow me yow down there that was good says i me yow
me yow as soft as i could and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed
then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the tree and sure enough there was jim_tom_sawyer waiting for me
we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the tree back towards the end of the widow garden stooping down so as the branches wouldnt scrape our head
chapter ii when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise we scrouched down and laid still
miss_watson big nigger named jim_tom_sawyer was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty clear because there was a light behind him
he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute listening then he says who dah he listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us
we could a touched him nearly well likely it was minute and minute that there warnt a sound and we all there so close together
there was a place on my ankle that got to itching but i dasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right between my shoulders
if you are with the quality or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you aint sleepy if you are anywheres where it wont do for you to scratch why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand place
seemed like i die if i couldnt scratch well i ve noticed that thing plenty time since pretty soon jim_tom_sawyer says say who is you
whar is you dog my cats ef i didn hear sumf well i know what i gwyne to do i gwyne to set down here and listen
he leaned his back up against a tree and stretched his leg out till one of them most touched one of mine
tell i hears it agin so he set down on the ground betwixt me and jim_tom_sawyer my nose begun to itch
it itched till the tears come into my eye but i dasnt scratch then it begun to itch on the inside
next i got to itching underneath i didnt know how i was going to set still this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minute but it seemed a sight longer than that
i was itching in eleven different place now i reckoned i couldnt stand it more a minute longer but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try
jim_tom_sawyer he made a sign to me kind of a little noise with his mouth and we went creeping away on our hand and knees
just then jim_tom_sawyer begun to breathe heavy next he begun to snore and then i was pretty soon comfortable again when we was ten foot off jim_tom_sawyer whispered to me and wanted to tie jim_tom_sawyer to the tree for fun
but i said no he might wake and make a disturbance and then they find out i warnt in then jim_tom_sawyer said he hadnt got candle enough and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more
but jim_tom_sawyer wanted to resk it so we slid in there and got three candle and jim_tom_sawyer laid five cents on the table for pay
i didnt want him to try i said jim_tom_sawyer might wake up and come then we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do jim_tom_sawyer
but he must crawl to where jim_tom_sawyer was on his hand and knees and play something on him i waited and it seemed a good while everything was so still and lonesome
as soon as jim_tom_sawyer was back we cut along the path around the garden fence and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house
jim_tom_sawyer said he slipped jim_tom_sawyer hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him and jim_tom_sawyer stirred a little but he didnt wake
afterwards jim_tom_sawyer said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance and rode him all over the state and then set him under the tree again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it
and next time jim_tom_sawyer told it he said they rode him down to new orleans and after that every time he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all over saddle boils
nigger would come mile to hear jim_tom_sawyer tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country
jim_tom_sawyer was monstrous proud about it and he got so he wouldnt hardly notice the other nigger strange nigger would stand with their mouths open and look him all over same as if he was a wonder
nigger is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such thing jim_tom_sawyer would happen in and say hm
jim_tom_sawyer always kept that five center piece round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hand and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but he never told what it was he said to it
nigger would come from all around there and give jim_tom_sawyer anything they had just for a sight of that five center piece but they wouldnt touch it because the devil had had his hand on it
jim_tom_sawyer was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches
well when jim_tom_sawyer and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four light twinkling where there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and awful still and grand
we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben rogers and two or three more of the boy hid in the old tanyard
so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the big scar on the hillside and went ashore
we went to a clump of bushes and jim_tom_sawyer made everybody swear to keep the secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest part of the bushes
what you know bout witches and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat then we lit the candle and crawled in on our hand and knees
jim_tom_sawyer poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldnt a noticed that there was a hole
we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold and there we stopped
we went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up jim_tom_sawyer says now we ll start this band of robbers and call it jim_tom_sawyer gang
everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name in blood everybody was willing
it swore every boy to stick to the band and never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band
and nobody that didnt belong to the band could use that mark and if he did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed
and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever
so jim_tom_sawyer got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on and read it everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked jim_tom_sawyer if he got it out of his own head
he said some of it but the rest was out of pirate book and robber book and every gang that was high toned had it
some thought it would be good to kill the family of boy that told the secrets jim_tom_sawyer said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it in
then ben rogers says here huck_creeps huck_finn he haint got no family what you going to do bout him well haint he got a father says jim_tom_sawyer
he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seen in these parts for a year or more
they talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldnt be fair and square for the others
yes he got a father but you cant never find him these day well nobody could think of anything to do everybody was stumped and set still
i was most ready to cry but all at once i thought of a way and so i offered them miss_watson
then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and i made my mark on the paper
they could kill her everybody said oh she ll do that all right huck_creeps can come in now says ben rogers what the line of business of this gang
nothing only robbery and murder jim_tom_sawyer said but who are we going to rob house or cattle or stuff stealing cattle and such thing aint robbery
we stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on and kill the people and take their watches and money
it burglary says jim_tom_sawyer we aint burglars that aint no sort of style we are highwaymen must we always kill the people
some authorities think different but mostly it considered best to kill them except some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till they re ransomed
oh certainly it best ransomed what that i dont know but that what they do i ve seen it in book and so of course that what we ve got to do
but how can we do it if we dont know what it is why blame it all we ve got to do it
dont i tell you it in the book do you want to go to doing different from what in the book and get thing all muddled up
oh that all very fine to say jim_tom_sawyer but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do it to them that the thing i want to get at
now what do you reckon it is well i dont know but per aps if we keep them till they re ransomed it means that we keep them till they re dead
we ll keep them till they re ransomed to death and a bothersome lot they ll be too eating up everything and always trying to get loose
how can they get loose when there a guard over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg
now that something like that ll answer why couldnt you said that before how you talk ben rogers a guard
well that is good so somebody got to set up all night and never get any sleep just so as to watch them
i think that foolishness why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here
because it aint in the book so that why now ben rogers do you want to do thing regular or dont you that the idea
dont you reckon that the people that made the book knows what the correct thing to do do you reckon you can learn em anything
not by a good deal no sir we ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way all right
i dont mind but i say it a fool way anyhow say do we kill the woman too well ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you
you fetch them to the cave and you re always as polite as pie to them and by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more
i wouldnt let on kill the woman no nobody ever saw anything in the book like that well if that the way i agreed but i dont take no stock in it
mighty soon we ll have the cave so cluttered up with woman and fellows waiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbers
little tommy barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didnt want to be a robber any more
so they all made fun of him and called him cry baby and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets
but jim_tom_sawyer give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people
ben rogers said he couldnt get out much only sundays and so he wanted to begin next sunday but all the boy said it would be wicked to do it on sunday and that settled the thing
they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected jim_tom_sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started home
but go ahead i aint got nothing to say i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking
well i got a good going over in the morning from old miss_watson on account of my clothe but the widow she didnt scold but only cleaned off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could
my new clothe was all greased up and clayey and i was dog tired chapter iii then miss_watson she took me in the closet and prayed but nothing come of it
she told me to pray every day and whatever i asked for i would get it but it warnt so i tried it
once i got a fish line but no hooks it warnt any good to me without hooks i tried for the hooks three or four time but somehow i couldnt make it work
by and by one day i asked miss_watson to try for me but she said i was a fool she never told me why and i couldnt make it out no way
i says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why dont deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork
i set down one time back in the wood and had a long think about it why cant the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole
i went and told the widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts
this was too many for me but she told me what she meant i must help other people and do everything i could for other people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself
why cant miss_watson fat up no says i to my self there aint nothing in it this was including miss_watson as i took it
i went out in the wood and turned it over in my mind a long time but i couldnt see no advantage about it except for the other people so at last i reckoned i wouldnt worry about it any more but just let it go
sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a body mouth water but maybe next day miss_watson would take hold and knock it all down again
i judged i could see that there was two providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow providence but
i thought it all out and reckoned i would belong to the widow if he wanted me though i couldnt make out how he was a going to be any better off then than what he was before seeing i was so ignorant and so kind of low down and ornery
pap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable for me i didnt want to see him no more
he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hand on me though i used to take to the wood most of the time when he was around
if miss_watson got him there warnt no help for him any more well about this time he was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people said
they judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like pap but they couldnt make nothing out of the face because it had been in the water so long
it warnt much like a face at all they said he was floating on his back in the water they took him and buried him on the bank
but i warnt comfortable long because i happened to think of something i knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float on his back but on his face
so i knowed then that this warnt pap but a woman dressed up in a man clothe so i was uncomfortable again
i judged the old man would turn up again by and by though i wished he wouldnt we played robber now and then about a month and then i resigned
we used to hop out of the wood and go charging down on hog drivers and woman in carts taking garden stuff to market but we never hived any of them
jim_tom_sawyer called the hogs ingots and he called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and marked
all the boy did we hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people but only just pretended but i couldnt see no profit in it
one time jim_tom_sawyer sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get together and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and rich a rabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter mules all
loaded down with di monds and they didnt have only a guard of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called it and kill the lot and scoop the thing
he said we must slick up our swords and gun and get ready he never could go after even a turnip cart
but he must have the swords and gun all scoured up for it though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them till you rotted and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before
i didnt believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and a rabs but i wanted to see the camels and elephants so i was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the word we rushed out of the wood and down the hill
but there warnt no spaniards and a rabs and there warnt no camels nor no elephants it warnt anything but a sunday school picnic and only a primer class at that
we busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though ben rogers got a rag doll and jo harper got a hymn book and a tract and then the teacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut
he said there was loads of them there anyway and he said there was a rabs there too and elephants and thing
i didnt see no di monds and i told jim_tom_sawyer so i said why couldnt we see them then he said if i warnt so ignorant but had read a book called don quixote i would know without asking
he said there was hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sunday school just out of spite
he said it was all done by enchantment i said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians
why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson
jim_tom_sawyer said i was a numskull they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church
well i says pose we got some genies to help us cant we lick the other crowd then how you going to get them
why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come tearing in with the thunder and lightning a ripping around and the smoke a rolling and everything they re told to do they up and do it
they dont think nothing of pulling a shot tower up by the roots and belting a sunday school superintendent over the head with it or any other man
i dont know how do they get them who makes them tear around so why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring
if he tells them to build a palace forty mile long out of di monds and fill it full of chewing gum or whatever you want and fetch an emperor daughter from china for you to marry they ve got to do it and they ve got to do it before sun up next morning too
they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring and they ve got to do whatever he says and more they ve got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand
well says i i think they are a pack of flat head for not keeping the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that
and what more if i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp
how you talk huck_creeps huck_finn why you have to come when he rubbed it whether you wanted to or not
all right then i would come but i lay i make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country
what and i as high as a tree and as big as a church shucks it aint no use to talk to you huck_creeps huck_finn
i thought all this over for two or three day and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it
i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the wood and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warnt no use none of the genies come
you dont seem to know anything somehow perfect saphead so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of jim_tom_sawyer lies
i reckoned he believed in the a rabs and the elephants but as for me i think different it had all the marks of a sunday school
i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six time seven is thirty five and i dont reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever
chapter iv well three or four months run along and it was well into the winter now i dont take no stock in mathematics anyway
whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up
at first i hated the school but by and by i got so i could stand it so the longer i went to school the easier
it got to be i was getting sort of used to the widow way too and they warnt so raspy on me
living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the wood sometimes and so that was a rest to me
i liked the old way best but i was getting so i liked the new one too a little bit the widow said i was coming along slow but sure and doing very satisfactory
i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck but miss_watson was in ahead of me and crossed me off
she said she warnt ashamed of me one morning i happened to turn over the salt cellar at breakfast she says take your hand away huckleberry what a mess you are always making
the widow put in a good word for me but that warnt going to keep off the bad luck i knowed that well enough
i started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be
there is way to keep off some kind of bad luck but this wasnt one of them kind so i never tried to do anything but just poked along low spirited and on the watch out
i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence
they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden fence
there was an inch of new snow on the ground and i seen somebody tracks it was funny they hadnt come in after standing around so
i couldnt make it out it was very curious somehow i was going to follow around but i stooped down to look at the tracks first
i didnt notice anything at first but next i did there was a cross in the left boot heel made with big nails to keep off the devil
i was up in a second and shinning down the hill i looked over my shoulder every now and then but i didnt see nobody
i was at judge thatcher as quick as i could get there he said why my boy you are all out of breath
did you come for your interest no sir i says is there some for me oh yes a half yearly is in last night over a hundred and fifty dollar
quite a fortune for you you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand because if you take it you ll spend it
no sir i says i dont want to spend it i dont want it at all nor the six thousand nuther
i want you to take it i want to give it to you the six thousand and all he looked surprised
he couldnt seem to make it out he says why what can you mean my boy i says dont you ask me no questions about it please
you ll take it wont you he says well i puzzled is something the matter please take it says i and dont ask me nothing then i wont have to tell no lies
he studied a while and then he says oho i think i see you want to sell all your property to me not give it
then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says there you see it says for a consideration
that the correct idea that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it here a dollar for you
miss_watson nigger jim_tom_sawyer had a hair ball as big as your fist which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic with it
now you sign it so i signed it and left he said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed everything
so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again for i found his tracks in the snow
jim_tom_sawyer got out his hair ball and said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor
what i wanted to know was what he was going to do and was he going to stay it fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch
jim_tom_sawyer tried it again and then another time and it acted just the same jim_tom_sawyer got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened
i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warnt no good because the brass showed through the silver a little and it wouldnt pass nohow even if the brass didnt show because it was so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time
but it warnt no use he said it wouldnt talk he said sometimes it wouldnt talk without money i reckoned i wouldnt say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge
i said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hair ball would take it because maybe it wouldnt know the difference
jim_tom_sawyer smelt it and bit it and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hair ball would think it was good
he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you couldnt see no brass and it wouldnt feel greasy no more and so anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hair ball
well i knowed a potato would do that before but i had forgot it jim_tom_sawyer put the quarter under the hair ball and got down and listened again
this time he said the hair ball was all right he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to
i says go on so the hair ball talked to jim_tom_sawyer and jim_tom_sawyer told it to me he says yo ole father doan know yit what he a gwyne to do
sometimes he spec he ll go way en den agin he spec he ll stay de bes way is to res easy en

en by dat you gwyne to git hung when i lit my candle and went up to my room that night
there sat pap his own self chapter i had shut the door to then i turned around and there he was
i reckoned i was scared now too but in a minute i see i was mistaken that is after the first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he being so unexpected but right away after i see
i used to be scared of him all the time he tanned me so much i warnt scared of him worth bothring about
his hair was long and tangled and greasy and hung down and you could see his eye shining through like he was behind vines
there warnt no color in his face where his face showed it was white not like another man white but a white to make a body sick a white to make a body flesh crawl a tree toad white a fish belly white
he was most fifty and he looked it it was all black no gray so was his long mixed up whiskers as for his clothe just rags that was all
he had one ankle resting ont other knee the boot on that foot was busted and two of his toes stuck through and he worked them now and then
his hat was laying on the floor an old black slouch with the top caved in like a lid i stood a looking at him he set there a looking at me with his chair tilted back a little
i set the candle down i noticed the window was up so he had clumb in by the shed he kept a looking me all over
by and by he says starchy clothe very you think you re a good deal of a big bug dont you maybe i am maybe i aint i says
dont you give me none your lip says he you ve put on considerable many frills since i been away
i ll take you down a peg before i get done with you you re educated too they say can read and write you think you re better your father now dont you because he cant
i ll take it out of you who told you you might meddle with such hifalut foolishness hey who told you you could

the widow she told me nobody never told her well i ll learn her how to meddle and looky here you drop that school you hear
i ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better n
what he is you lemme catch you fooling around that school again you hear your mother couldnt read and she couldnt write nuther before she died
none of the family couldnt before they died i cant and here you re a swelling yourself up like this i aint the man to stand it you hear
when i read about a half a minute he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house
say lemme hear you read i took up a book and begun something about general washington and the wars he says it so
you can do it i had my doubts when you told me now looky here you stop that putting on frills
i wont have it i ll lay for you my smarty and if i catch you about that school i ll tan you good
first you know you ll get religion too i never see such a son he took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy and says what this
it something they give me for learning my lessons good he tore it up and says i ll give you something better i ll give you a cowhide
a bed and bedclothes and a look glass and a piece of carpet on the floor and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard
he set there a mumbling and a growling a minute and then he says aint you a sweet scented dandy though i never see such a son
i bet i ll take some these frills out you before i done with you why there aint no end to your airs they say you re rich
hey how that they lie that how looky here mind how you talk to me i a standing about all i can stand now so dont gimme no sass
i ve been in town two day and i haint heard nothing but about you bein rich i heard about it away down the river too
that why i come you git me that money to morrow i want it i haint got no money it a lie
judge thatcher got it you git it i want it i haint got no money i tell you you ask judge thatcher he ll tell you the same
all right i ll ask him and i ll make him pungle too or i ll know the reason why say how much you got in your pocket
i haint got only a dollar and i want that to it dont make no difference what you want it for you just shell it out
he took it and bit it to see if it was good and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky said he hadnt had a drink all day
when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when i reckoned he was gone
he come back and put his head in again and told me to mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lick me if i didnt drop that
next day he was drunk and he went to judge thatcher and bullyragged him and tried to make him give up the money but he couldnt
the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge that had just come and he didnt know the old man
so he said courts mustnt interfere and separate family if they could help it said he druther not take a child away from its father
i want it and then he swore he make the law force him so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business
that pleased the old man till he couldnt rest he said he cowhide me till i was black and blue if i didnt raise some money for him
i borrowed three dollar from judge thatcher and pap took it and got drunk and went a blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed him again for a week
but he said he was satisfied said he was boss of his son and he make it warm for him
so he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just old pie to him so to speak
and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such thing till the old man cried and said he been a fool and fooled away his life but now he was a going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldnt be ashamed of and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him
the judge said he could hug him for them word so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said he been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said he believed it
the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again
and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says look at it gentleman and ladies all take a hold of it shake it
there a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more it the hand of a man that started in on a new life and ll die before he ll go back
when he got out the new judge said he was a going to make a man of him you mark them word
dont forget i said them it a clean hand now shake it dont be afeard so they shook it one after the other all around and cried
the judge wife she kissed it then the old man he signed a pledge made his mark the judge said it was the holiest time on record or something like that
then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty rod and clumb back again and had a good old time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two place and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun up
and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it the judge he felt kind of sore
he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didnt know no other way
well pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he went for me too for not stopping school
he catched me a couple of time and thrashed me but i went to school just the same and dodged him or outrun him most of the time
chapter vi i didnt want to go to school much before but i reckoned i go now to spite pap that law trial was a slow business appeared like they warnt ever going to get started on it so every now
every time he got money he got drunk and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town and every time he raised cain he got jailed
and then i borrow two or three dollar off of the judge for him to keep from getting a cowhiding he was just suited this kind of thing was right in his line
and so she told him at last that if he didnt quit using around there she would make trouble for him
he got to hanging around the widow too much well wasnt he mad he said he would show who was huck_creeps huck_finn boss
so he watched out for me one day in the spring and catched me and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff and crossed over to the illinois shore where it was woody and there warn t
no house but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldnt find it if you didnt know where it was
he kept me with him all the time and i never got a chance to run off we lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put the key under his head night
he had a gun which he had stole i reckon and we fished and hunted and that was what we lived on
every little while he locked me in and went down to the store three mile to the ferry and traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time and licked me
the widow she found out where i was by and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me but pap drove him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till i was used to being where i was and liked it all but the cowhide part
two months or more run along and my clothe got to be all rags and dirt and i didnt see how i ever got to like it so well at the widow where you had to wash and eat on a plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forever bothering over a book and have old miss_watson pecking at you all the time
it was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smoking and fishing and no book nor study i didnt want to go back no more
i had stopped cussing because the widow didnt like it but now i took to it again because pap hadnt no objections
it was pretty good time up in the wood there take it all around but by and by pap got too handy with his hick ry and i couldnt stand it
i was all over welts he got to going away so much too and locking me in once he locked me in and was gone three day
it was dreadful lonesome i judged he had got drownded and i wasnt ever going to get out any more i was scared
i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time but i couldnt find no way
there warnt a window to it big enough for a dog to get through i couldnt get up the chimbly it was too narrow
pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred time well i was most all the time at it because it was about the only way to put in the time
but this time i found something at last i found an old rusty wood saw without any handle it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof
there was an old horse blanket nailed against the log at the far end of the cabin behind the table to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out
i got under the table and raised the blanket and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom
the door was thick solid oak slabs i greased it up and went to work log out big enough to let me through
well it was a good long job but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard pap gun in the wood
i got rid of the signs of my work and dropped the blanket and hid my saw and pretty soon pap come in
pap warnt in a good humor so he was his natural self he said he was down town and everything was going wrong
his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial but then there was way to put it off a long time and judge thatcher knowed how to do it
and he said people allowed there be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian and they guessed it would win this time
this shook me up considerable because i didnt want to go back to the widow any more and be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it
then the old man got to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think of and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadnt skipped any and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round including a considerable parcel of people which he didnt know the name of and so called them
what his name when he got to them and went right along with his cussing he said he would like to see the widow get me
he said he would watch out and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till they dropped
that made me pretty uneasy again but only for a minute i reckoned i wouldnt stay on hand till he got that chance
and they couldnt find me the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the thing he had got
there was a fifty pound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon ammunition and a four gallon jug of whisky and an old book and two newspapers for wadding besides some tow
i thought it all over and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some line and take to the wood when i run away
i guessed i wouldnt stay in one place but just tramp right across the country mostly night time and hunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldnt ever find me any more
i toted up a load and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest i judged i would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough and i reckoned he would
i didnt notice how long i was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded
i got so full of it i got the thing all up to the cabin and then it was about dark
while i was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up and went to ripping again
he had been drunk over in town and laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at
whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment this time he says call this a govment
a body would a thought he was adam he was just all mud why just look at it and see what it like
here the law a standing ready to take a man son away from him a man own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising
yes just as that man has got that son raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin for him and give him a rest the law up and goes for him
and they call that govment that aint all nuther the law back that old judge thatcher up and helps him to keep me out
here what the law does the law takes a man worth six thousand dollar and up ards and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and lets him go round in clothe that aint fitten for a hog
o my property they call that govment a man cant get his rights in a govment like this sometimes i ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all
yes and i told em so i told old thatcher so to his face lot of em heard me and can tell what i said
i says look at my hat if you call it a hat but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it below my chin and then it aint rightly a hat at all but more like my head was shoved up through a jint stove pipe
look at it says i such a hat for me to wear one of the wealthiest man in this town if i could git my rights
says i for two cents i leave the blamed country and never come a near it agin them the very word
oh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful why looky here there was a free nigger there from ohio a mulatter most as white as a white man
he had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the shiniest hat and there aint a man in that town that got as fine clothe as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a silver headed cane the awfulest old gray headed nabob in the state
and what do you think they said he was a fessor in a college and could talk all kind of languages and knowed everything
and that aint the wust they said he could vote when he was at home well that let me out thinks i what is the country a coming to
it was lection day and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warnt too drunk to get there but when they told me there was a state in this country where they let that nigger vote i drawed out
i says i ll never vote agin them the very word i said they all heard me and the country may rot for all me
and to see the cool way of that nigger why he wouldnt a give me the road if i hadnt shoved him out the way
i ll never vote agin as long as i live i says to the people why aint this nigger put up at auction and sold that what i want to know
why they said he couldnt be sold till he been in the state six months and he hadnt been there that long yet
and what do you reckon they said there now that a specimen they call that a govment that cant sell a free nigger till he been in the state six months
here a govment that calls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is a govment and yet got to set stock still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal white shirted free nigger and
so he never noticed where his old limber leg was taking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language mostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the tub some too all along here and there
he hopped around the cabin considerable first on one leg and then on the other holding first one shin and then the other one and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick
but it warnt good judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body hair raise and down he went in the dirt and rolled there and held his toes and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous
he had heard old sowberry hagan in his best day and he said it laid over him too but i reckon that was sort of piling it on maybe
pap was agoing on he said so his own self afterwards after supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens
i judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then i would steal the key or saw myself out one ort other
that was always his word he drank and drank and tumbled down on his blankets by and by but luck didnt run my way
he didnt go sound asleep but was uneasy he groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time
at last i got so sleepy i couldnt keep my eye open all i could do and so before i knowed what i was about
i dont know how long i was asleep but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and i was up
i was sound asleep and the candle burning there was pap looking wild and skipping around every which way and yelling about snake
he said they was crawling up his leg and then he would give a jump and scream and say one had bit him on the cheek but i couldnt see no snake
he started and run round and round the cabin hollering take him off take him off he biting me on the neck
pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then he rolled over and over wonderful fast kicking thing every which way and striking and grabbing at the air with his hand and screaming and saying there was devils a hold of him
i never see a man look so wild in the eye he wore out by and by and laid still a while moaning
then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound i could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the wood and it seemed terrible still
he was laying over by the corner by and by he raised up part way and listened with his head to one side
he says very low tramp tramp tramp that the dead tramp tramp tramp they re coming after me but i wont go oh they re here dont touch me
then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him alone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table still a begging and then he went to crying
dont hand off they re cold let go oh let a poor devil alone i could hear him through the blanket
by and by he rolled out and jumped up on his foot looking wild and he see me and went for me
he chased me round and round the place with a clasp knife calling me the angel of death and saying he would kill me and then i couldnt come for him no more
i begged and told him i was only huck_creeps but he laughed such a screechy laugh and roared and cussed and kept on chasing me up
once when i turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders and i thought i was gone but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightning and saved myself
pretty soon he was all tired out and dropped down with his back against the door and said he would rest a minute and then kill me
he put his knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and then he would see who was who
by and by i got the old split bottom chair and clumb up as easy as i could not to make any noise and got down the gun
i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then i laid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set down behind it to wait for him to stir
so he dozed off pretty soon and how slow and still the time did drag along chapter vii git up
what you bout i opened my eye and looked around trying to make out where i was it was after sun up and i had been sound asleep
i judged he didnt know nothing about what he had been doing so i says somebody tried to get in so i was laying for him
pap was standing over me looking sour and sick too he says what you doin with this gun why didnt you roust me out
dont stand there palavering all day but out with you and see if there a fish on the line for breakfast
well i tried to but i couldnt i couldnt budge you well all right i ll be along in a minute
i noticed some piece of limbs and such thing floating down and a sprinkling of bark so i knowed the river had begun to rise
he unlocked the door and i cleared out up the river bank i reckoned i would have great time now if i was over at the town
the june rise used to be always luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down and piece of log raft sometimes a dozen log together so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood yards and the sawmill
i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap andt other one out for what the rise might fetch along
well all at once here comes a canoe just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long riding high like a duck
i just expected there be somebody laying down in it because people often done that to fool folks and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they raise up and laugh at him
i shot head first off of the bank like a frog clothe and all on and struck out for the canoe but it warnt so this time
it was a drift canoe sure enough and i clumb in and paddled her ashore thinks i the old man will be glad when he sees this she worth ten dollar
but when i got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as i was running her into a little creek like a gully all hung over with vines and willows
i struck another idea i judged i hide her good and then stead of taking to the wood when i run off i go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good and not have such a rough time tramping on foot
it was pretty close to the shanty and i thought i heard the old man coming all the time but i got her hid and then i out and looked around a bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun
he abused me a little for being so slow but i told him i fell in the river and that was what made me so long
so he hadnt seen anything when he got along i was hard at it taking up a trot line i knowed he would see i was wet and then he would be asking questions
while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being about wore out i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me you see all kind of thing might happen
well i didnt see no way for a while but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water and he says another time a man comes a prowling round here you roust me out you hear
we got five catfish off the line and went home that man warnt here for no good i a shot him
then he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had been saying give me the very idea i wanted
next time you roust me out you hear i says to myself i can fix it now so nobody wont think of following me
about twelve clock we turned out and went along up the bank the river was coming up pretty fast and lot of driftwood going by on the rise
by and by along comes part of a log raft nine log fast together we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore
anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catch more stuff but that warnt pap style
then we had dinner nine log was enough for one time he must shove right over to town and sell so he locked me in and took the skiff and started off towing the raft about half past three
i waited till i reckoned he had got a good start then i out with my saw and went to work on that log again
before he wast other side of the river i was out of the hole him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder
i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then i done the same with the side of bacon
i took all the coffee and sugar there was and all the ammunition i took the wadding i took the bucket and gourd i took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two blankets and the skillet and the coffee pot
i judged he wouldnt come back that night then the whisky jug i took fish line and matches and other thing everything that was worth a cent
i wanted an axe but there wasnt any only the one out at the woodpile and i knowed why i was going to leave that
i cleaned out the place i fetched out the gun and now i was done i had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many thing
so i fixed that as good as i could from the outside by scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust
then i fixed the piece of log back into its place and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent up at that place and didnt quite touch ground
if you stood four or five foot away and didnt know it was sawed you wouldnt never notice it and besides this was the back of the cabin and it warn t
likely anybody would go fooling around there it was all grass clear to the canoe so i hadnt left a track
so i took the gun and went up a piece into the wood and was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms
i followed around to see i stood on the bank and looked out over the river all safe i shot this fellow and took him into camp
i fetched the pig in and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him down on the ground to bleed i say ground because it was ground hard packed and no boards
well next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it all i could drag and i started it from the pig and dragged it to the door and through the wood down to the river and dumped it in and down it sunk out of sight
i took the axe and smashed in the door i beat it and hacked it considerable a doing it you could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground
i did wish jim_tom_sawyer was there i knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancy touches
well last i pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good and stuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner
then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldnt drip till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river
so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house
i took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw for there warn t
nobody could spread himself like jim_tom_sawyer in such a thing as that now i thought of something else no knives and forks on the place pap done everything with his clasp knife about the cooking
then i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes and ducks too you might say in the season
there was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went mile away i dont know where but it didnt go to the river
the meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake i dropped pap whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done by accident
then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldnt leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe again
it was about dark now so i dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise
i made fast to a willow then i took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan
i says to myself they ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me
and they ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the thing
they wont ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass they ll soon get tired of that and wont bother no more about me
all right i can stop anywhere i want to george_jackson island is good enough for me i know that island pretty well and nobody ever comes there
and then i can paddle over to town night and slink around and pick up thing i want george_jackson island the place
i was pretty tired and the first thing i knowed i was asleep when i woke up i didnt know where i was for a minute
the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift log that went a slipping along black and still hundreds of yards out from shore
i set up and looked around a little scared then i remembered the river looked mile and mile across everything was dead quiet and it looked late and smelt late
i took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and start when i heard a sound away over the water
you know what i mean i dont know the word to put it in i listened pretty soon i made it out
it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it a still night
i peeped out through the willow branches and there it was a skiff away across the water i couldnt tell how many was in it
it kept a coming and when it was abreast of me i see there warnt but one man in it think i
he dropped below me with the current and by and by he came a swinging up shore in the easy water and he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him
maybe it pap though i warnt expecting him well it was pap sure enough and sober too by the way he laid his oars
i didnt lose no time the next minute i was a spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank
i made two mile and a half and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing and people might see me and hail me
i laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe looking away into the sky not a cloud in it
the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine i never knowed it before
i got out amongst the driftwood and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float and how far a body can hear on the water such night
i heard people talking at the ferry landing i heard what they said too every word of it one man said it was getting towards the long day and the short night now
t other one said this warnt one of the short one he reckoned and then they laughed and he said it over again and they laughed again then they waked up another fellow and told him and laughed but he didnt laugh he ripped out something brisk and said let him alone
the first fellow said he lowed to tell it to his old woman she would think it was pretty good but he said that warnt nothing to some thing he had said in his time
i heard one man say it was nearly three clock and he hoped daylight wouldnt wait more than about a week longer
after that the talk got further and further away and i couldnt make out the word any more but i could hear the mumble and now and then a laugh too but it seemed a long way off
i rose up and there was george_jackson island about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid like a steamboat without any light
i was away below the ferry now there warnt any signs of the bar at the head it was all under water now
i shot past the head at a ripping rate the current was so swift and then i got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the illinois shore
i run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that i knowed about i had to part the willow branches to get in and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside
i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town three mile away where there was three or four light twinkling
a monstrous big lumber raft was about a mile up stream coming along down with a lantern in the middle of it
it didnt take me long to get there i watched it come creeping down and when it was most abreast of where i stood
i heard a man say stern oars there heave her head to stabboard i heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side
there was a little gray in the sky now so i stepped into the wood and laid down for a nap before breakfast
i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about thing and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied
i could see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big tree all about and gloomy in there amongst them
there was freckled place on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and the freckled place swapped about a little showing there was a little breeze up there
chapter viii the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight clock a couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly
i was powerful lazy and comfortable didnt want to get up and cook breakfast well i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deep sound of boom
away up the river i rouses up and rests on my elbow and listens pretty soon i hears it again
i hopped up and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves and i see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long way up about abreast the ferry
and there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down i knowed what was the matter now boom
i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat side you see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make my carcass come to the top
i was pretty hungry but it warnt going to do for me to start a fire because they might see the smoke
the river was a mile wide there and it always looks pretty on a summer morning so i was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if i only had a bite to eat
well then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there
so says i i ll keep a lookout and if any of them floating around after me i ll give them a show
so i set there and watched the cannon smoke and listened to the boom i changed to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i could have and i warnt disappointed
a big double loaf come along and i most got it with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated out further
of course i was where the current set in the closest to the shore i knowed enough for that but by and by along comes another one and this time i won
i took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver and set my teeth in it was baker bread what the quality eat none of your low down corn pone
i got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munching the bread and watching the ferry boat and very well satisfied
i says now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has gone and done it
so there aint no doubt but there is something in that thing that is there something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays but it dont work for me and i reckon it dont work for only just the right kind
the ferryboat was floating with the current and i allowed i have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along because she would come in close where the bread did
when she got pretty well along down towards me i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place
and then something struck me i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching where the log forked i could peep through
by and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore
pap and judge thatcher and bessie thatcher and jo harper and jim_tom_sawyer and his old aunt polly and mars_sid and miss_mary_jane and plenty more
everybody was talking about the murder but the captain broke in and says look sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe he washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water edge
they all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearly in my face and kept still watching with all their might
most everybody was on the boat i hope so anyway i didnt hope so i could see them first rate but they couldnt see me
then the captain sung out stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke and i judged i was gone
if they a had some bullets in i reckon they a got the corpse they was after well i see i warnt hurt thanks to goodness
i could hear the booming now and then further and further off and by and by after an hour i didnt hear it no more
the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island the island was three mile long
they turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the missouri side under steam and booming once in a while as they went
i judged they had got to the foot and was giving it up but they didnt yet a while i crossed over to that side and watched them
when they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore and went home to the town
i knowed i was all right now nobody else would come a hunting after me i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick wood
i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my thing under so the rain couldnt get at them
i catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw and towards sundown i started my camp fire and had supper
when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty well satisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so i went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted the stars and drift log and raft that come down and then went to bed
there aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesome you cant stay so you soon get over it
then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast and so for three day and night no difference just the same thing
i was boss of it it all belonged to me so to say and i wanted to know all about it but mainly i wanted to put in the time
i found plenty strawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and green razberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show
but the next day i went exploring around down through the island they would all come handy by and by i judged
well i went fooling along in the deep wood till i judged i warnt far from the foot of the island
i had my gun along but i hadnt shot nothing it was for protection thought i would kill some game nigh home
about this time i mighty near stepped on a good sized snake and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers and i after it trying to get a shot at it
i clipped along and all of a sudden i bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking
i never waited for to look further but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever i could
every now and then i stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened but my breath come so hard i couldnt hear nothing else
my heart jumped up amongst my lungs i slunk along another piece further then listened again and so on and so on
if i see a stump i took it for a man if i trod on a stick and broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two
and i only got half and the short half too when i got to camp i warnt feeling very brash there
so i got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight and i put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year camp and then clumb a tree
warnt much sand in my craw but i says this aint no time to be fooling around i reckon i was up in the tree two hour but i didnt see nothing i didnt hear nothing
well i couldnt stay up there forever so at last i got down but i kept in the thick wood and on the lookout all the time
i only thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand thing all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast
so when it was good and dark i slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the illinois bank about a quarter of a mile
by the time it was night i was pretty hungry i went out in the wood and cooked a supper and i had about made up my mind
i would stay there all night when i hear a plunkety plunk plunkety plunk and says to myself horse coming and next i hear people voices
i got everything into the canoe as quick as i could and then went creeping through the wood to see what i could find out
i hadnt got far when i hear a man say we better camp here if we can find a good place the horse is about beat out
let look around i didnt wait but shoved out and paddled away easy i tied up in the old place and reckoned i would sleep in the canoe
i didnt sleep much i couldnt somehow for thinking and every time i waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck
by and by i says to myself i cant live this way i a going to find out who it is that here on the island with me
so the sleep didnt do me no good i ll find it out or bust well i felt better right off
so i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows
the moon was shining and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day i poked along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and sound asleep
well by this time i was most down to the foot of the island a little ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as saying the night was about done
i give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the wood
i sat down there on a log and looked out through the leaves i see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river
so i took my gun and slipped off towards where i had run across that camp fire stopping every minute or two to listen
but in a little while i see a pale streak over the treetops and knowed the day was coming but i hadnt no luck somehow i couldnt seem to find the place
but by and by sure enough i catched a glimpse of fire away through the tree i went for it cautious and slow
by and by i was close enough to have a look and there laid a man on the ground it most give me the fan tods
i set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him and kept my eye on him steady
he had a blanket around his head and his head was nearly in the fire it was getting gray daylight now
pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket and it was miss_watson jim_tom_sawyer i bet i was glad to see him
i says hello jim_tom_sawyer and skipped out he bounced up and stared at me wild then he drops down on his knees and puts his hand together and says doan hurt me dont
i haint ever done no harm to a ghos i alwuz liked dead people en done all i could for em
you go en git in de river agin whah you longs en doan do nuffn to ole jim_tom_sawyer at uz awluz yo fren
well i warnt long making him understand i warnt dead i was ever so glad to see jim_tom_sawyer i warnt lonesome now
i told him i warnt afraid of him telling the people where i was i talked along but he only set there and looked at me never said nothing
then i says it good daylight le get breakfast make up your camp fire good what de use er makin up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck
but you got a gun haint you den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries strawberries and such truck i says
is that what you live on i couldn git nuffn else he says why how long you been on the island jim_tom_sawyer

i think i could how long you ben on de islan since the night i got killed no y what has you lived on
but you got a gun oh yes you got a gun dat good now you kill sumfn en i ll make up de fire
so we went over to where the canoe was and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the tree i fetched meal and bacon and coffee and coffee pot and frying pan and sugar and tin cups and the nigger was set back considerable because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft
i catched a good big catfish too and jim_tom_sawyer cleaned him with his knife and fried him when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot
jim_tom_sawyer laid it in with all his might for he was most about starved then when we had got pretty well stuffed we laid off and lazied
by and by jim_tom_sawyer says but looky here huck_creeps who wuz it dat uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn t
you then i told him the whole thing and he said it was smart he said jim_tom_sawyer couldnt get up no better plan than what i had
then i says how do you come to be here jim_tom_sawyer and how you get here he looked pretty uneasy and didnt say nothing for a minute
then he says maybe i better not tell why jim_tom_sawyer well dey reasons but you wouldn tell on me ef i uz to tell you would you huck_creeps

he said his father laid mighty sick once and some of them catched a bird and his old granny said his father would die and he did
and jim_tom_sawyer said you mustnt count the thing you are going to cook for dinner because that would bring bad luck
and he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died the bees must be told about it before sun up next morning or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die
jim_tom_sawyer said bees wouldnt sting idiots but i didnt believe that because i had tried them lot of time myself and they wouldnt sting me
he said it was death the same if you shook the table cloth after sundown i had heard about some of these thing before but not all of them
i said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck and so i asked him if there warnt any good luck signs

yes en i rich now come to look at it i owns mysef en i wuth eight hund dollar i wisht i had de money
i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that i found when i was exploring so we started and soon got to it because the island was only three mile long and a quarter of a mile wide
i wouldn want no mo chapter ix this place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foot high
we tramped and clumb around all over it and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side towards illinois
we had a rough time getting to the top the side was so steep and the bushes so thick the cavern was as big as two or three room bunched together and jim_tom_sawyer could stand up straight in it
jim_tom_sawyer was for putting our traps in there right away but i said we didnt want to be climbing up and down there all the time
jim_tom_sawyer said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the traps in the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island and they would never find us without dog
and besides he said them little birds had said it was going to rain and did i want the thing to get wet
so we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern and lugged all the traps up there
it was cool in there then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows
the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on
we took some fish off of the line and set them again and begun to get ready for dinner so we built it there and cooked dinner
we spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in there we put all the other thing handy at the back of the cavern
pretty soon it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds was right about it directly it begun to rain and it rained like all fury too and i never see the wind blow
it would get so dark that it looked all blue black outside and lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the tree off a little way looked dim and spider webby and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the tree down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arm as if they was just wild and next when it was just about the bluest and blackest fst
it was as bright as glory and you have a little glimpse of tree tops a plunging about away off yonder in the storm hundreds of yards further than you could see before dark as sin again in a second and now you hear the thunder let go with an awful crash and then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down the sky towards the under side of the world like rolling empty barrels down stairs where it long stairs and they bounce a good deal you know
so it was one of these regular summer storms jim_tom_sawyer this is nice i says i wouldnt want to be nowhere else but here
pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn bread well you wouldnt a ben here it hadnt a ben for jim_tom_sawyer
you a ben down dah in de wood widout any dinner en gittn mos drownded too dat you would honey chickens knows when it gwyne to rain en so do de birds chile
the river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve day till at last it was over the bank
on that side it was a good many mile wide but on the missouri side it was the same old distance across a half a mile because the missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs
the water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low place and on the illinois bottom daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe
we went winding in and out amongst the tree and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way
well on every old broken down tree you could see rabbits and snake and such thing and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame on account of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to but not the snake and turtles they would slide off in the water
it was mighty cool and shady in the deep wood even if the sun was blazing outside the ridge our cavern was in was full of them
we could a had pets enough if we wanted them one night we catched a little section of a lumber raft nice pine planks
it was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long and the top stood above water six or seven inches a solid level floor
we could see saw log go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them go we didnt show ourselves in daylight
another night when we was up at the head of the island just before daylight here comes a frame house down on the west side
but it was too dark to see yet so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight
she was a two story and tilted over considerable we paddled out and got aboard clumb in at an upstairs window the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island
we could make out a bed and a table and two old chairs and lot of thing around about on the floor and there was clothe hanging against the wall
then we looked in at the window there was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man
so jim_tom_sawyer says hello you but it didnt budge so i hollered again and then jim_tom_sawyer says de man aint asleep he dead
you hold still i ll go en see he went and bent down and looked and says it a dead man
yes indeedy naked too he ben shot in de back i reck he ben dead two er three day come in huck_creeps but doan look at his face it too gashly
i didnt look at him at all jim_tom_sawyer throwed some old rags over him but he neednt done it i didnt want to see him
there was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottles and a couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of word and pictures made with charcoal
there was two old dirty calico dresses and a sun bonnet and some woman underclothes hanging against the wall and some man clothing too
we put the lot into the canoe it might come good there was a boy old speckled straw hat on the floor i took that too
and there was a bottle that had had milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck
we would a took the bottle but it was broke there was a seedy old chest and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke
the way thing was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry and warnt fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff
we got an old tin lantern and a butcher knife without any handle and a bran new barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallow candle and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet and some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dog collar and a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didnt have no label on them and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good curry comb and jim_tom_sawyer he found a ratty old fiddle bow and a wooden leg
the straps was broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg though it was too long for me and not long enough for jim_tom_sawyer and we couldnt find the other one though we hunted all around
they stood open but there warnt nothing left in them that was any account and so take it all around we made a good haul
we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was pretty broad day so i made jim_tom_sawyer lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good way off
when we was ready to shove off i paddled over to the illinois shore and drifted down most a half a mile doing it
i crept up the dead water under the bank and hadnt no accidents and didnt see nobody we got home all safe
after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed but jim_tom_sawyer didnt want to
he said it would fetch bad luck and besides he said he might come and ha nt us he said a man that warnt buried was more likely to go a ha nting around than one that was planted and comfortable
that sounded pretty reasonable so i didnt say no more but i couldnt keep from studying over it and wishing i knowed who shot the man and what they done it for
we rummaged the clothe we got and found eight dollar in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat
jim_tom_sawyer said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat because if they a knowed the money was there they wouldnt a left it
i says now you think it bad luck but what did you say when i fetched in the snake skin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday
chapter i said i reckoned they killed him too but jim_tom_sawyer didnt want to talk about that you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake skin with my hand
well here your bad luck we ve raked in all this truck and eight dollar besides i wish we could have some bad luck like this every day jim_tom_sawyer
never you mind honey never you mind dont you git too peart it a comin mind i tell you it a comin
well after dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge and got out of tobacco
it did come too it was a tuesday that we had that talk i went to the cavern to get some and found a rattlesnake in there
i killed him and curled him up on the foot of jim_tom_sawyer blanket ever so natural thinking there be some fun when jim_tom_sawyer found him there
well by night i forgot all about the snake and when jim_tom_sawyer flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snake mate was there and bit him
he jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring
i laid him out in a second with a stick and jim_tom_sawyer grabbed pap whisky jug and begun to pour it down
that all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it
jim_tom_sawyer told me to chop off the snake head and throw it away and then skin the body and roast a piece of it
he was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel i done it and he eat it and said it would help cure him
then i slid out quiet and throwed the snake clear away amongst the bushes for i warnt going to let jim_tom_sawyer find out it was all my fault not if i could help it
he made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist too he said that that would help jim_tom_sawyer sucked and sucked at the jug and
now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again
his foot swelled up pretty big and so did his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so i judged he was all right
but i druther been bit with a snake than pap whisky jim_tom_sawyer was laid up for four day and night then the swelling was all gone and he was around again
i wouldnt ever take a holt of a snake skin again with my hand now that i see what had come of it
and he said that handling a snake skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadnt got to the end of it yet
he said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand time than take up a snake skin in his hand
well i was getting to feel that way myself though i ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest thing a body can do
old hank bunker done it once and bragged about it and in less than two year he got drunk and fell off of the shot tower and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeways between two barn door for a coffin and buried him so so they say but i didnt see it
i made up my mind jim_tom_sawyer said he reckoned i would believe him next time pap told me but anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way like a fool
well the day went along and the river went down between its bank again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man being six foot two inches long and weighed over two hundred pounds
we couldnt handle him of course he would a flung us into illinois we just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded
we found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lot of rubbage we split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool in it
jim_tom_sawyer said he had it there a long time to coat it over so and make a ball of it it was as big a fish as was ever catched in the mississippi i reckon
jim_tom_sawyer said he hadnt ever seen a bigger one he would a been worth a good deal over at the village
they peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market house there everybody buys some of him his meat as white as snow and makes a good fry
next morning i said it was getting slow and dull and i wanted to get a stirring up some way i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and find out what was going on
then he studied it over and said couldnt i put on some of them old thing and dress up like a girl
jim_tom_sawyer liked that notion but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp that was a good notion too
so we shortened up one of the calico gowns and i turned up my trouser leg to my knees and got into it
i put on the sun bonnet and tied it under my chin and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove pipe
jim_tom_sawyer hitched it behind with the hooks and it was a fair fit jim_tom_sawyer said nobody would know me even in the daytime hardly
i practiced around all day to get the hang of the thing and by and by i could do pretty well in them only jim_tom_sawyer said i didnt walk like a girl and he said i must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches pocket
i started across to the town from a little below the ferry landing and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town
i took notice and done better i started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark i tied up and started along the bank
there was a light burning in a little shanty that hadnt been lived in for a long time and i wondered who had took up quarters there
i slipped up and peeped in at the window there was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table
i didnt know her face she was a stranger for you couldnt start a face in that town that i didnt know
now this was lucky because i was weakening i was getting afraid i had come people might know my voice and find me out
but if this woman had been in such a little town two day she could tell me all i wanted to know so i knocked at the door and made up my mind
i wouldnt forget i was a girl chapter xi come in says the woman and i did she says take a cheer
i done it she looked me all over with her little shiny eye and says what might your name be
sarah williams where bouts do you live in this neighborhood no in hookerville seven mile below i ve walked all the way
i was so hungry i had to stop two mile below here at a farm so i aint hungry no more
and i all tired out hungry too i reckon i ll find you something no i aint hungry it what makes me so late
my mother down sick and out of money and everything and i come to tell my uncle abner moore he lives at the upper end of the town she says
i haint ever been here before do you know him no but i dont know everybody yet i havent lived here quite two weeks
it a considerable way to the upper end of the town you better stay here all night take off your bonnet
she said she wouldnt let me go by myself but her husband would be in by and by maybe in a hour and a half and she send him along with me
then she got to talking about her husband and about her relations up the river and her relations down the river and about how much better off they used to was and how they didnt know
but they made a mistake coming to our town instead of letting well alone and so on and so on till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along
she told about me and jim_tom_sawyer finding the six thousand dollar only she got it ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and what a hard lot i was and at last she got down to where i was murdered
no i says i ll rest a while i reckon and go on i aint afeared of the dark i says who done it
we ve heard considerable about these goings on down in hookerville but we dont know who twas that killed huck_creeps huck_finn
well i reckon there a right smart chance of people here that like to know who killed him some think old huck_finn done it himself
no is that so most everybody thought it at first he ll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched but before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named jim_tom_sawyer
she run on and never noticed i had put in at all the nigger run off the very night huck_creeps huck_finn was killed
why he i stopped i reckoned i better keep still so there a reward out for him three hundred dollar
you see he come to town the morning after the murder and told about it and was out with em on the ferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left
and there a reward out for old huck_finn too two hundred dollar before night they wanted to lynch him but he was gone you see
well next day they found out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen sence ten clock the night the murder was done
so then they put it on him you see and while they was full of it next day back comes old huck_finn and went boo hooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over illinois with
the judge gave him some and that evening he got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard looking strangers and then went off with them
well he haint come back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thing blows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed thing so folks would think robbers done it and then he get huck_creeps money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit
people do say he warnt any too good to do it oh he sly i reckon if he dont come back for a year he ll be all right
you cant prove anything on him you know everything will be quieted down then and he ll walk in huck_creeps money as easy as nothing
yes i reckon so i dont see nothing in the way of it has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it
oh no not everybody a good many thinks he done it but they ll get the nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of him
why are they after him yet well you re innocent aint you does three hundred dollar lay around every day for people to pick up
a few day ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call george_jackson island
some folks think the nigger aint far from here i one of them but i haint talked it around dont anybody live there says i no nobody says they
i didnt say any more but i done some thinking i was pretty near certain i seen smoke over there about the head of the island a day or two before that
so i says to myself like as not that nigger hiding over there anyway says i it worth the trouble to give the place a hunt
i haint seen any smoke sence so i reckon maybe he gone if it was him but husband going over to see him and another man
he was gone up the river but he got back to day and i told him as soon as he got here two hour ago
i had to do something with my hand so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it
i had got so uneasy i couldnt set still my hand shook and i was making a bad job of it
i put down the needle and thread and let on to be interested and i was too and says three hundred dollar is a power of money
when the woman stopped talking i looked up and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little i wish my mother could get it
he went up town with the man i was telling you of to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun
is your husband going over there to night oh yes they ll go over after midnight couldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytime
after midnight he ll likely be asleep and they can slip around through the wood and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark if he got one
yes and couldnt the nigger see better too i didnt think of that the woman kept looking at me pretty curious and i didnt feel a bit comfortable
pretty soon she says what did you say your name was honey miss_mary_jane williams somehow it didnt seem to me that i said it was miss_mary_jane before
so i didnt look up seemed to me i said it was sarah so i felt sort of cornered and was afeared maybe i was looking it too
i wished the woman would say something more the longer she set still the uneasier i was but now she says honey i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in
oh yes i did sarah miss_mary_jane williams sarah my first name some calls me sarah some calls me miss_mary_jane oh that the way of it
yes i was feeling better then but i wished i was out of there anyway i couldnt look up yet
well the woman fell to talking about how hard time was and how poor they had to live and how the rat was as free as if they owned the place and so forth and so on and then i got easy again
she was right about the rat you see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while
she said she had to have thing handy to throw at them when she was alone or they wouldnt give her no peace
she showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shot with it generly but she wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didnt know whether she could throw true now
but she watched for a chance and directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and said ouch
it hurt her arm so then she told me to try for the next one i wanted to be getting away before the old man got back but of course i didnt let on
i got the thing and the first rat that showed his nose i let drive and if he a stayed where he was
he a been a tolerable sick rat she said that was first rate and she reckoned i would hive the next one
she went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with
i held up my two hand and she put the hank over them and went on talking about her and her husband matters
but she broke off to say keep your eye on the rat you better have the lead in your lap handy
so she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and i clapped my leg together on it
then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face and very pleasant and says come now what your real name
and she went on talking but only about a minute wh what mum what your real name is it bill or jim_tom_sawyer or bob or what is it
i reckon i shook like a leaf and i didnt know hardly what to do but i says please to dont poke fun at a poor girl like me mum
if i in the way here i ll no you wont set down and stay where you are i aint going to hurt you and i aint going to tell on you nuther
you just tell me your secret and trust me i ll keep it and what more i ll help you so ll my old man if you want him to
you see you re a runaway prentice that all it aint anything there aint no harm in it you ve been treated bad and you made up your mind to cut
so i said it wouldnt be no use to try to play it any longer and i would just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musnt go back on her promise
then i told her my father and mother was dead and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river and he treated me so bad i couldnt stand it no longer
he went away to be gone a couple of day and so i took my chance and stole some of his daughter old clothe and cleared out and i had been three night coming the thirty mile
i traveled night and hid daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat i carried from home lasted me all the way and i had a plenty
i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me and so that was why i struck out for this town of goshen
bless you child i wouldnt tell on you tell me all about it now that a good boy goshen child
why a man i met at daybreak this morning just as i was going to turn into the wood for my regular sleep
he told me when the roads forked i must take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to goshen
this aint goshen this is st petersburg goshen ten mile further up the river who told you this was goshen
he was drunk i reckon he told you just exactly wrong well he did act like he was drunk but it aint no matter now
i got to be moving along i ll fetch goshen before daylight hold on a minute i ll put you up a snack to eat
so she put me up a snack and says say when a cow laying down which end of her gets up first
you might want it answer up prompt now dont stop to study over it which end gets up first the hind end mum
well then a horse the for rard end mum which side of a tree does the moss grow on
north side if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats with their head pointed the same direction
the whole fifteen mum well i reckon you have lived in the country i thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again
dont forget and tell me it elexander before you go and then get out by saying it george_jackson elexander when i catch you
what your real name now george_jackson peters mum well try to remember it george_jackson and dont go about woman in that old calico
bless you child when you set out to thread a needle dont hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it hold the needle still and poke the thread at it that the way a woman most always does but a man always doest other way
and when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can and miss your rat about six or seven foot
throw stiff armed from the shoulder like there was a pivot there for it to turn on like a girl not from the wrist and elbow with your arm out to one side like a boy
you do a girl tolerable poor but you might fool man maybe and mind you when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap
she throws her knees apart she dont clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump of lead
why i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle and i contrived the other thing just to make certain
now trot along to your uncle sarah miss_mary_jane williams george_jackson elexander peters and if you get into trouble you send word to mrs judith loftus which is me and i ll do what i can to get you out of it
keep the river road all the way and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you the river road a rocky one and your foot ll be in a condition when you get to goshen i reckon
i went up the bank about fifty yards and then i doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house
i jumped in and was off in a hurry i went up stream far enough to make the head of the island and then started across
when i was about the middle i heard the clock begin to strike so i stops and listens the sound come faint over the water but clear eleven
when i struck the head of the island i never waited to blow though i was most winded but i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot
then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half below as hard as i could go
i took off the sun bonnet for i didnt want no blinders on then i landed and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern
there jim_tom_sawyer laid sound asleep on the ground i roused him out and says git up and hump yourself jim_tom_sawyer there aint a minute to lose
jim_tom_sawyer never asked no questions he never said a word but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared
by that time everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid
they re after us we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show a candle outside after that
i took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look but if there was a boat around i couldnt see it for stars and shadows aint good to see by
then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade past the foot of the island dead still never saying a word
it must a been close on to one clock when we got below the island at last and the raft did seem to go mighty slow
if a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois shore and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought to put the gun in the canoe or a fishing line or anything to eat
chapter xii we was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many thing it warnt good judgment to put everything on the raft
if the man went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i built and watched it all night for jim_tom_sawyer to come
anyways they stayed away from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnt no fault of mine
when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet and covered up the raft with them
i played it as low down on them as i could so she looked like there had been a cave in in the bank there
we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois side and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place so we warnt afraid of anybody running across us
we laid there all day and watched the raft and steamboat spin down the missouri shore and up bound steamboat fight the big river in the middle
i told jim_tom_sawyer all about the time i had jabbering with that woman and jim_tom_sawyer said she was a smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt set down and watch a camp fire no sir she fetch a dog
a tow head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow teeth well then i said why couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog
jim_tom_sawyer said he bet she did think of it by the time the man was ready to start and he believed they must a gone up town to get a dog
and so they lost all that time or else we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village no indeedy we would be in that same old town again
when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our head out of the cottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sight so jim_tom_sawyer took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the thing dry
jim_tom_sawyer made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves
right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly the wigwam would keep it from being seen
so i said i didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as long as they didnt we made an extra steering oar too because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something
we fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down stream to keep from getting run over but we wouldnt have to light it for up stream boat unless we see we was in what they call a crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low bank being still a little under water so up bound boat didnt always run the channel but hunted easy water
this second night we run between seven and eight hour with a current that was making over four mile an hour
it was kind of solemn drifting down the big still river laying on our back looking up at the stars and we didnt ever feel like talking loud and it warnt often that we laughed only a little kind of a low chuckle
we had mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened to us at all that night nor the next nor the next
every night we passed town some of them away up on black hillsides nothing but just a shiny bed of light not a house could you see
we catched fish and talked and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness the fifth night we passed st louis and it was like the whole world lit up
in st petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in st louis but i never believed it till i see that wonderful spread of light at two clock that still night
every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten clock at some little village and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warnt roosting comfortable and took him along
pap always said take a chicken when you get a chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does and a good deed aint ever forgot
there warnt a sound there everybody was asleep i never see pap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he used to say anyway
morning before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or thing of that kind
pap always said it warnt no harm to borrow thing if you was meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warnt anything but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it
jim_tom_sawyer said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three thing from the list and say we wouldnt borrow them any more then he reckoned it wouldnt be no harm to borrow the others
so we talked it over all one night drifting along down the river trying to make up our mind whether to drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelons or what
but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory and concluded to drop crabapples and simmons we warnt feeling just right before that but it was all comfortable now
i was glad the way it come out too because crabapples aint ever good and the simmons wouldnt be ripe for two or three months yet
we shot a water fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didnt go to bed early enough in the evening
the fifth night below st louis we had a big storm after midnight with a power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solid sheet
take it all round we lived pretty high we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself
when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead and high rocky bluffs on both side by and by says i hel lo jim_tom_sawyer looky yonder
it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock we was drifting straight down for her the lightning showed her very distinct
she was leaning over with part of her upper deck above water and you could see every little chimbly guy clean and clear and a chair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it when the flashes come
i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river
well it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysterious like i wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see what there was there
so i says le land on her jim_tom_sawyer but jim_tom_sawyer was dead against it at first he says i doan want to go fool long er no wrack
we doin blame well en we better let blame well alone as de good book says like as not dey a watchman on dat wrack
watchman your grandmother i says there aint nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot house and do you reckon anybody going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot house such a night as this when it likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute
jim_tom_sawyer couldnt say nothing to that so he didnt try and besides i says we might borrow something worth having out of the captain stateroom
steamboat captains is always rich and get sixty dollar a month and they dont care a cent what a thing costs you know long as they want it
seegars i bet you and cost five cents apiece solid cash stick a candle in your pocket i cant rest jim_tom_sawyer till we give her a rummaging
he call it an adventure that what he call it and he land on that wreck if it was his last act
do you reckon jim_tom_sawyer would ever go by this thing not for pie he wouldnt and wouldnt he throw style into it wouldn t
he spread himself nor nothing why you think it was christopher lumbus discovering kingdom come i wish jim_tom_sawyer was here
jim_tom_sawyer he grumbled a little but give in he said we mustnt talk any more than we could help and then talk mighty low
the lightning showed us the wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick and made fast there the deck was high out here
we went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with our foot and spreading our hand out to fend off the guys for it was so dark we couldnt see no sign of them
pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us in front of the captain door which was open and by jimminy away down through the texas hall we see a light
and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder jim_tom_sawyer whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to come along
i says all right and was going to start for the raft but just then i heard a voice wail out and say oh please dont boy i swear i wont ever tell
you always want more your share of the truck and you ve always got it too because you ve sworet if you didnt you tell
another voice said pretty loud it a lie jim_tom_sawyer turner you ve acted this way before but this time you ve said it jest
one time too many you re the meanest treacherousest hound in this country by this time jim_tom_sawyer was gone for the raft
i was just a biling with curiosity and i says to myself jim_tom_sawyer wouldnt back out now and so i wont either
so i dropped on my hand and knees in the little passage and crept aft in the dark till there warn t
then in there i see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot and two man standing over him and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol
i a going to see what going on here but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross hall of the texas this one kept pointing the pistol at the man head on the floor and saying i like to
and i orter too a mean skunk the man on the floor would shrivel up and say oh please dont bill i haint ever goin to tell
and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say deed you aint you never said no truer thing n
that you bet you and once he said hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got the best of him and tied him
he a killed us both and what for jist for noth jist because we stood on our rights that what for
but i lay you aint a goin to threaten nobody any more jim_tom_sawyer turner put up that pistol bill bill says i dont want to jake packard
i for killin him and didnt he kill old hatfield jist the same way and dont he deserve it but i dont want him killed and i ve got my reasons for it
bless yo heart for them word jake packard i ll never forgit you long i live says the man on the floor sort of blubbering
packard didnt take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where i was there in the dark and motioned bill to come
i crawfished as fast as i could about two yards but the boat slanted so that i couldnt make very good time so to keep from getting run over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side
the man came a pawing along in the dark and when packard got to my stateroom he says here come in here
and in he come and bill after him but before they got in i was up in the upper berth cornered and sorry i come
then they stood there with their hand on the ledge of the berth and talked i couldnt see them but i could tell where they was by the whisky they been having
i was glad i didnt drink whisky but it wouldnt made much difference anyway because most of the time they couldnt a treed me because i didnt breathe
i was too scared and besides a body couldnt breathe and hear such talk they talked low and earnest bill wanted to kill turner
if we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldnt make no difference after the row and the way we ve served him
he says he said he ll tell and he will shore you re born he ll turn state evidence now you hear me
i for putting him out of his trouble so i says packard very quiet blame it i sorter begun to think you wasnt
well then that all right le go and do it hold on a minute i haint had my say yit
but what i say is this it aint good sense to go court around after a halter if you can git at what you re up to in some way that jist as good and
you listen to me shooting good but there quieter way if the thing got to be done at the same time dont bring you into no resks
well my idea is this we ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we ve overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hide the truck
aint that so you bet it is but how you goin to manage it this time then we ll wait
now i say it aint a goin to be more two hour befo this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river
see he ll be drownded and wont have nobody to blame for it but his own self i reckon that a considerble sight better killin of him
i unfavorable to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it it aint good sense it aint good morals
aint i right yes i reck you are but pose she dont break up and wash off well we can wait the two hour anyway and see
cant we all right then come along so they started and i lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambled forward
and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of a moan and i says quick jim_tom_sawyer it aint no time for fooling around and moaning there a gang of murderers in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows cant get away from the wreck
it was dark as pitch there but i said in a kind of a coarse whisper jim_tom_sawyer there one of em going to be in a bad fix
but if we find their boat we can put all of em in a bad fix for the sheriff ll get em
quick hurry i ll hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard you start at the raft and oh my lordy lordy raf
dey ain no raf no mo she done broke loose en gone i en here we is chapter xiii well i catched my breath and most fainted
shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that but it warnt no time to be sentimentering we got to find that boat now had to have it for ourselves
so we went a quaking and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it was too seemed a week before we got to the stern
no sign of a boat jim_tom_sawyer said he didnt believe he could go any further so scared he hadnt hardly any strength left he said
but i said come on if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix sure so on we prowled again
we struck for the stern of the texas and found it and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight hanging on from shutter to shutter for the edge of the skylight was in the water
when we got pretty close to the cross hall door there was the skiff sure enough i could just barely see her
i felt ever so thankful in another second i would a been aboard of her but just then the door opened
one of the man stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me and i thought i was gone but he jerked it in again and says heave that blame lantern out sight bill
he flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself and set down it was packard
then bill he come out and got in packard says in a low voice all ready shove off i couldnt hardly hang on to the shutters i was so weak
but bill says hold on you go through him no didnt you no so he got his share the cash yet
well then come along no use to take truck and leave money say wont he suspicion what we re up to
the door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a half second i was in the boat and jim_tom_sawyer come tumbling after me
maybe he wont but we got to have it anyway come along so they got out and went in i out with my knife and cut the rope and away we went
we went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of the paddle box and past the stern then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up every last sign of her and we was safe and knowed it
when we was three or four hundred yards down stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim_tom_sawyer turner was
we didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly even breathe then jim_tom_sawyer manned the oars and we took out after our raft
now was the first time that i begun to worry about the man i reckon i hadnt had time to before i begun to think how dreadful it was even for murderers to be in such a fix
i says to myself there aint no telling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how would i like it
so says i to jim_tom_sawyer the first light we see we ll land a hundred yards below it or above it in a place where it a good hiding place for you and the skiff and then i ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung when their time comes
but that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm again and this time worse than ever
the rain poured down and never a light showed everybody in bed i reckon we boomed along down the river watching for light and watching for our raft
after a long time the rain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimpering and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and we made for it
it was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again we seen a light now away down to the right on shore
so i said i would go for it the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck
we hustled it on to the raft in a pile and i told jim_tom_sawyer to float along down and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile and keep it burning till i come then i manned my oars and shoved for the light
as i got down towards it three or four more showed up on a hillside it was a village i closed in above the shore light and laid on my oars and floated
i skimmed around for the watchman a wondering whereabouts he slept and by and by i found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down between his knees
as i went by i see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double hull ferryboat i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun to cry
he stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch and then he says hello what up
he says oh dang it now dont take on so we all has to have our trouble and this ll come out all right
dont cry bub what the trouble i says pap and mam and sis and then i broke down what the matter with em
i the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck hand and sometimes i the freight and passengers
i aint as rich as old jim_tom_sawyer hornback and i cant be so blame generous and good to jim_tom_sawyer dick and harry as what he is and slam around money the way he does
but i ve told him a many a timet i wouldnt trade place with him for says i a sailor life the life for me and i derned if i live two mile out town where there aint nothing ever goin on not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it
they re they re are you the watchman of the boat yes he says kind of pretty well satisfied like says i i broke in and says they re in an awful peck of trouble and
who is why pap and mam and sis and miss hooker and if you take your ferryboat and go up there
up where where are they on the wreck what wreck why there aint but one what you dont mean the walter scott
yes good land what are they doin there for gracious sakes well they didnt go there a purpose
i bet they didnt why great goodness there aint no chance for em if they dont git off mighty quick why how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape
she was a visiting there at booth landing and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse ferry to stay all night at her friend house miss what you may call her
i disremember her name and they lost their steering oar and swung around and went a floating down stern first about two mile and saddle baggsed on the wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horse was all lost but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck
well about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading scow and it was so dark we didnt notice the wreck till we was right on it and so we saddle baggsed but all of us was saved but bill whipple
easy enough miss hooker was a visiting up there to the town yes booth landing go on and oh he was the best cretur i most wisht it had been me i do
my george_jackson it the beatenest thing i ever struck and then what did you all do well we hollered and took on but it so wide there we couldnt make nobody hear
so pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow i was the only one that could swim so i made a dash for it and miss hooker
i made the land about a mile below and been fooling along ever since trying to get people to do something but they said what in such a night and such a current
she said if i didnt strike help sooner come here and hunt up her uncle and he fix the thing there aint no sense in it go for the steam ferry
now if you ll go and by george_jackson i like to and blame it i dont know but i will but who in the dingnation a going to pay for it
do you reckon your pap why that all right miss hooker she tole me particular that her uncle hornback great gun
looky here you break for that light over yonder way and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of a mile out you ll come to the tavern tell em to dart you out to jim_tom_sawyer hornback and he ll foot the bill
is he her uncle and dont you fool around any because he ll want to know the news tell him i ll have his niece all safe before he can get to town
i struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in among some woodboats for i couldnt rest easy till i could see the ferryboat start
but take it all around i was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang for not many would a done it
hump yourself now i a going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer i wished the widow knowed about it
i judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in
well before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding along down a kind of cold shiver went through me and then i struck out for her
she was very deep and i see in a minute there warnt much chance for anybody being alive in her i pulled all around her and hollered a little but there wasnt any answer all dead still
i felt a little bit heavy hearted about the gang but not much for i reckoned if they could stand it i could
then here comes the ferryboat so i shoved for the middle of the river on a long down stream slant and when i judged i was out of eye reach i laid on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hooker remainders because the captain would know her uncle hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore and i laid into my work and went a booming down the river
it did seem a powerful long time before jim_tom_sawyer light showed up and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off
by the time i got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so we struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turned in and slept like dead people
by and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothe and all sorts of other thing and a lot of book and a spyglass and three boxes of seegars
we laid off all the afternoon in the wood talking and me reading the book and having a general good time
i told jim_tom_sawyer all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat and i said these kind of thing was adventures but he said he didnt want no more adventures
he said that when i went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died because he judged it was all up with him
anyway it could be fixed for if he didnt get saved he would get drownded and if he did get saved whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward and then miss_watson would sell him south sure
chapter xiv we hadnt ever been this rich before in neither of our lives the seegars was prime well he was right
i read considerable to jim_tom_sawyer about king and duke and earls and such and how gaudy they dressed and how much style they put on and called each other your majesty and your grace and your lordship and so on stead of mister and jim_tom_sawyer eye bugged out and he was interested
he was most always right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger he says i didn know dey was so many un um
i haint hearn bout none un um skasely but ole king sollermun onless you counts dem king dat in a pack er yards
i says why they get a thousand dollar a month if they want it they can have just as much as they want everything belongs to them
how much do a king git get ain dat gay en what dey got to do huck_creeps they dont do nothing
why how you talk they just set around no is dat so of course it is they just set around except maybe when there a war then they go to the war
we skipped out and looked but it warnt nothing but the flutter of a steamboat wheel away down coming around the point so we come back
yes says i and other time when thing is dull they fuss with the parlyment and if everybody dont go just so he whacks their head off
but other time they just lazy around or go hawking just hawking and sp sh you hear a noise but mostly they hang round the harem
roun de which harem what de harem the place where he keeps his wives dont you know about the harem

is a frenchman a man yes well den dad blame it why doan he talk like a man you answer me dat
we judged that three night more would fetch us to cairo at the bottom of illinois where the ohio river comes in and that was what we was after
we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the ohio amongst the free states and then be out of trouble
well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead to tie to for it wouldnt do to try to run in a fog but when i paddled ahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warnt anything but little saplings to tie to
i passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots
i see it warnt no use wasting word you cant learn a nigger to argue so i quit chapter xv and away she went
i see the fog closing down and it made me so sick and scared i couldnt budge for most a half a minute
i jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke
it seemed to me and then there warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenty yards but she didnt come i was in such a hurry i hadnt untied her
i got up and tried to untie her but i was so excited my hand shook so i couldnt hardly do anything with them
that was all right as far as it went but the towhead warnt sixty yards long and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way i was going than a dead man
i it wont do to paddle first i know i ll run into the bank or a towhead or something i got to set still and float and yet it mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hand still at such a time
as soon as i got started i took out after the raft hot and heavy right down the towhead thinks i whooped and listened
away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop and up comes my spirits i went tearing after it listening sharp to hear it again
and the next time i was heading away to the left of it and not gaining on it much either for i was flying around this way and that andt other but it was going straight ahead all the time
i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the time but he never did and it was the still place between the whoops that was making the trouble for me
the next time it come i see i warnt heading for it but heading away to the right of it well i fought along and directly i hears the whoop behind me
i was tangled good now that was somebody else whoop or else i was turned around i throwed the paddle down
i heard the whoop again it was behind me yet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing its place and i kept answering till by and by it was in front of me again and i knowed the current had swung the canoe head down stream and i was all right if that was jim_tom_sawyer and
not some other raftsman hollering i couldnt tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing dont look natural nor sound natural in a fog
the whooping went on and in about a minute i come a booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big tree on it and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared the currrent was tearing by them so swift
i set perfectly still then listening to my heart thump and i reckon i didnt draw a breath while it thumped a hundred
in another second or two it was solid white and still again i just give up then i knowed what the matter was
that cut bank was an island and jim_tom_sawyer had gone downt other side of it it warnt no towhead that you could float by in ten minute
it had the big timber of a regular island it might be five or six mile long and more than half a mile wide
i kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minute i reckon i was floating along of course four or five mile an hour but you dont ever think of that
no you feel like you are laying dead still on the water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you dont think to yourself how fast you re going but you catch your breath and think my how that snag tearing along
if you think it aint dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try it once you ll see
next for about a half an hour i whoops now and then at last i hears the answer a long way off and tries to follow it but i couldnt do it and
directly i judged i got into a nest of towheads for i had little dim glimpses of them on both side of me sometimes just a narrow channel between and some that i couldnt see i knowed was there because i hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the bank
well i warnt long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads and i only tried to chase them a little while anyway because it was worse than chasing a jack lantern
i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five time to keep from knocking the island out of the river and so i judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing it was floating a little faster than what i was
well i seemed to be in the open river again by and by but i couldnt hear no sign of a whoop nowheres
you never knowed a sound dodge around so and swap place so quick and so much i reckoned jim_tom_sawyer had fetched up on a snag maybe and it was all up with him
i was good and tired so i laid down in the canoe and said i wouldnt bother no more i didnt want to go to sleep of course but i was so sleepy
but i reckon it was more than a cat nap for when i waked up the stars was shining bright the fog was all gone and i was spinning down a big bend stern first
first i didnt know where i was i thought i was dreaming and when thing began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week
it was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both bank just a solid wall as well as
i couldnt help it so i thought i would take jest one little cat nap i could see by the stars i looked away down stream and seen a black speck on the water
i took after it but when i got to it it warnt nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together
when i got to it jim_tom_sawyer was setting there with his head down between his knees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steering oar
then i see another speck and chased that then another and this time i was right it was the raft the other oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt
i made fast and laid down under jim_tom_sawyer nose on the raft and began to gap and stretch my fists out against jim_tom_sawyer and says hello jim_tom_sawyer have i been asleep
so she had a rough time why didnt you stir me up goodness gracious is dat you huck_creeps en you ain dead you ain
drownded you back agin it too good for true honey it too good for true lemme look at you chile lemme feel you
no you ain dead you back agin live en soun jis de same ole huck_creeps de same ole huck_creeps thanks to goodness
what the matter with you jim_tom_sawyer you been a drinking drinkin has i ben a drinkin has i had a chance to be a drinkin
well then what makes you talk so wild how does i talk wild how why haint you been talking about my coming back and all that stuff as if i been gone away
huck_creeps huck_finn you look me in de eye look me in de eye haint you ben gone away gone away why what in the nation do you mean
i haint been gone anywheres where would i go to well looky here boss dey sumf wrong dey is is i me or who is i
is i heah or whah is i now dat what i wants to know well i think you re here plain enough but i think you re a tangle headed old fool jim_tom_sawyer
i is is i well you answer me dis didnt you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas to de tow head
no i didnt what tow head i haint see no tow head you haint seen no towhead looky here didnt de line pull loose en
de raf go a hummin down de river en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog what fog why de fog de fog dat been aroun all night
en didnt you whoop en didnt i whoop tell we got mix up in de island en one un us got los
ent other one was jis as good as los kase he didn know whah he wuz en didnt i bust up agin a lot er dem island en
have a turrible time en mos git drownded now ain dat so boss aint it so you answer me dat
well this is too many for me jim_tom_sawyer i haint seen no fog nor no island nor no trouble nor nothing
i been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minute ago and i reckon i done the same
you couldnt a got drunk in that time so of course you ve been dreaming dad fetch it how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minute
but huck_creeps it all jis as plain to me as it dont make no difference how plain it is there aint nothing in it
well hang it all you did dream it because there didnt any of it happen i know because i ve been here all the time
jim_tom_sawyer didnt say nothing for about five minute but set there studying over it then he says well den i reck n
i did dream it huck_creeps but dog my cats ef it aint de powerfullest dream i ever see en i haint ever had no dream
b fo dat tired me like dis one oh well that all right because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes
so jim_tom_sawyer went to work and told me the whole thing right through just as it happened only he painted it up considerable
but this one was a staving dream tell me all about it jim_tom_sawyer then he said he must start in and terpret it because it was sent for a warning
he said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good but the current was another man that would get us away from him
the whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didnt try hard to make out to understand them
the lot of towheads was trouble we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kind of mean folks but if we minded our business and didnt talk back and aggravate them we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river which was the free states and wouldnt have no more trouble
it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft but it was clearing up again now
oh well that all interpreted well enough as far as it goes jim_tom_sawyer i says but what does these thing stand for
they just take us into bad luck stead of keeping us out of it it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar
you could see them first rate now jim_tom_sawyer looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trash again
he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldnt seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away
but when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling and says what do dey stan for
i se gwyne to tell you when i got all wore out wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuz mos broke bekase
you wuz los en i didn yer no mo what become er me en de raf en when i wake up
en fine you back agin all safe en soun de tears come en i could a got down on my knees
en kiss yo foot i so thankful en all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole jim_tom_sawyer wid a lie
dat truck dah is trash en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren en makes em ashamed
then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without saying anything but that but that was enough
it was fifteen minute before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger but i done it and i warnt ever sorry for it afterwards neither
it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back i didnt do him no more mean tricks and i wouldnt done that one
we slept most all day and started out at night a little way behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession
if i a knowed it would make him feel that way chapter xvi she had four long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirty man likely
she had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an open camp fire in the middle and a tall flag pole at each end
there was a power of style about her it amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that
the river was very wide and was walled with solid timber on both side you couldnt see a break in it hardly ever or a light
we went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and got hot we talked about cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it
i said likely we wouldnt because i had heard say there warnt but about a dozen house there and if they didnt happen to have them lit up how was we going to know we was passing a town
but i said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again
jim_tom_sawyer said if the two big river joined together there that would show that disturbed jim_tom_sawyer and me too so the question was what to do
i said paddle ashore the first time a light showed and tell them pap was behind coming along with a trading scow and was a green hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was to cairo
jim_tom_sawyer thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it and waited there warnt nothing to do now
he said he be mighty sure to see it because he be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed it he be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom
but to look out sharp for the town and not pass it without seeing it every little while he jumps up and says dah she is
but it warnt it was jack lanterns or lightning bugs so he set down again and went to watching same as before
well i can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear him because i begun to get it through my head that he was most free and who was to blame for it
jim_tom_sawyer said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom why me i couldnt get that out of my conscience no how nor no way
it got to troubling me so i couldnt rest i couldnt stay still in one place it hadnt ever come home to me before what this thing was that i was doing
i tried to make out to myself that i warnt to blame because i didnt run jim_tom_sawyer off from his rightful owner but it warnt no use conscience up and says every time
but now it did and it stayed with me and scorched me more and more but you knowed he was running for his freedom and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody
conscience says to me what had poor miss_watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eye and never say one single word
that was so i couldnt get around that noway that was where it pinched what did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her
why she tried to learn you your book she tried to learn you your manners she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how
so mean that what she done i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead
i fidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and jim_tom_sawyer was fidgeting up and down past me we neither of us could keep still
every time he danced around and says dah cairo it went through me like a shot and i thought if it was cairo
he was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when he got enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close to where miss_watson lived and then they would both work to buy the two children and if their master wouldnt sell them they get an ab litionist to go and steal them
i reckoned i would die of miserableness jim_tom_sawyer talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself it most froze me to hear such talk
he wouldnt ever dared to talk such talk in his life before just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free
it was according to the old saying give a nigger an inch and he ll take an ell thinks i this is what comes of my not thinking
here was this nigger which i had as good as helped to run away coming right out flat footed and saying he would steal his children children that belonged to a man i didnt even know a man that hadnt ever done me no harm
my conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last i says to it let up on me it aint too late yet
i was sorry to hear jim_tom_sawyer say that it was such a lowering of him i ll paddle ashore at the first light and tell
i felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off all my trouble was gone i went to looking out sharp for a light and sort of singing to myself
by and by one showed jim_tom_sawyer sings out we safe huck_creeps we safe jump up and crack yo heels dat de good ole cairo at las i jis knows it
he jumped and got the canoe ready and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on and give me the paddle and as i shoved off he says pooty soon i ll be a shout for joy en
i says i ll take the canoe and go and see jim_tom_sawyer it mightnt be you know i ll say it all on accounts
o huck_creeps i a free man en i couldnt ever ben free ef it hadn ben for huck_creeps huck done it
jim_tom_sawyer wont ever forgit you huck_creeps you de bes fren jim_tom_sawyer ever had en you de only fren ole jim_tom_sawyer got now
i was paddling off all in a sweat to tell on him but when he says this it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me
i went along slow then and i warnt right down certain whether i was glad i started or whether i warnt
when i was fifty yards off jim_tom_sawyer says dah you goes de ole true huck_creeps de on white genlman dat ever kep his promise to ole jim_tom_sawyer
well i just felt sick but i says i got to do it i cant get out of it
right then along comes a skiff with two man in it with gun and they stopped and i stopped one of them says what that yonder
a piece of a raft i says do you belong on it yes sir any man on it
only one sir well there five nigger run off to night up yonder above the head of the bend is your man white or black
i didnt answer up prompt i tried to but the word wouldnt come i tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it but i warnt man enough

i wish you would says i because it pap that there and maybe you help me tow the raft ashore where the light is
i reckon we ll go and see for ourselves he sick and so is mam and miss_mary_jane ann oh the devil
we re in a hurry boy but i pose we ve got to come buckle to your paddle and let get along
when we had made a stroke or two i says pap ll be mighty much obleeged to you i can tell you
everybody goes away when i want them to help me tow the raft ashore and i cant do it by myself
i buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars well that infernal mean odd too say boy what the matter with your father

i will sir i will honest but dont leave us please set her back john set her back says one

we are right down sorry for you but we well hang it we dont want the small pox you see look here i ll tell you what to do
dont you try to land by yourself or you ll smash everything to piece you float along down about twenty mile and you ll come to a town on the left hand side of the river
it will be long after sun up then and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever
dont be a fool again and let people guess what is the matter now we re trying to do you a kindness so you just put twenty mile between us
that a good boy it wouldnt do any good to land yonder where the light is it only a wood yard say i reckon your father poor and i bound to say he in pretty hard luck
here i ll put a twenty dollar gold piece on this board and you get it when it floats by i feel mighty mean to leave you but my kingdom

good bye boy you do as mr parker told you and you ll be all right that so my boy good bye good bye
if you see any runaway nigger you get help and nab them and you can make some money by it good bye sir says i
they went off and i got aboard the raft feeling bad and low because i knowed very well i had done wrong and i see it warn t
i wont let no runaway nigger get by me if i can help it no use for me to try to learn to do right
a body that dont get started right when he little aint got no show when the pinch comes there aint nothing to back him up and keep him to his work and so he gets beat
then i thought a minute and says to myself hold on pose you a done right and give jim_tom_sawyer up would you felt better than what you do now
what the use you learning to do right when it troublesome to do right and aint no trouble to do wrong and the wages is just the same
no says i i feel bad i feel just the same way i do now well then says i i was stuck
so i reckoned i wouldnt bother no more about it but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time
i couldnt answer that i went into the wigwam jim_tom_sawyer warnt there i looked all around he warnt anywhere i says jim_tom_sawyer
here i is huck_creeps is dey out sight yit dont talk loud he was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out
he says i was a listenin to all de talk en i slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho if dey come aboard
i told him they were out of sight so he come aboard den i was gwyne to swim to de raf agin when dey was gone
but lawsy how you did fool em huck_creeps dat wuz de smartes dodge i tell you chile i spec it save ole jim_tom_sawyer
ole jim_tom_sawyer aint going to forgit you for dat honey then we talked about the money it was a pretty good raise twenty dollar apiece
jim_tom_sawyer said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states
he said twenty mile more warnt far for the raft to go but he wished we was already there towards daybreak we tied up and jim_tom_sawyer was mighty particular about hiding the raft good
then he worked all day fixing thing in bundles and getting all ready to quit rafting that night about ten we hove in sight of the light of a town away down in a left hand bend
i went off in the canoe to ask about it pretty soon i found a man out in the river with a skiff setting a trot line
i ranged up and says mister is that town cairo cairo no you must be a blame fool
what town is it mister if you want to know go and find out if you stay here botherin around me for about a half a minute longer you ll get something you wont want
i paddled to the raft jim_tom_sawyer was awful disappointed but i said never mind cairo would be the next place i reckoned
we passed another town before daylight and i was going out again but it was high ground so i didnt go
no high ground about cairo jim_tom_sawyer said i had forgot it we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left hand bank
i begun to suspicion something so did jim_tom_sawyer i says maybe we went by cairo in the fog that night
he says doan le talk about it huck_creeps po nigger cant have no luck i awluz spected dat rattlesnake skin warnt done wid its work
i wish i never seen that snake skin jim_tom_sawyer i do wish i never laid eye on it it aint yo fault huck_creeps you didn know
dont you blame yo self bout it when it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshore sure enough and outside was the old regular muddy
so it was all up with cairo we talked it all over it wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnt take the raft up the stream of course
so we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone
there warnt no way but to wait for dark and start back in the canoe and take the chance we didnt say a word for a good while
there warnt anything to say we both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake skin so what was the use to talk about it
it would only look like we was finding fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck and keep on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keep still
but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in
by and by we talked about what we better do and found there warnt no way we warnt going to borrow it when there warn t
anybody around the way pap would do for that might set people after us so we shoved out after dark on the raft
anybody that dont believe yet that it foolishness to handle a snake skin after all that that snake skin done for us will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us
the place to buy canoe is off of raft laying up at shore but we didnt see no raft laying up so we went along during three hour and more
well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the next meanest thing to fog you cant tell the shape of the river and you cant see no distance
it got to be very late and still and then along comes a steamboat up the river we lit the lantern and judged she would see it
up stream boat didnt generly come close to us they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs but night like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river
we could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till she was close she aimed right for us
often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinks he mighty smart
well here she comes and we said she was going to try and shave us but she didnt seem to be sheering off a bit
she was a big one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a black cloud with rows of glow worms around it but all of a sudden she bulged out big and scary with a long row of wide open furnace door shining like red hot teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us
there was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop the engines a powwow of cussing and whistling of steam and as jim_tom_sawyer went overboard on one side
i dived and i aimed to find the bottom too for a thirty foot wheel had got to go over me and i wanted it to have plenty of room
and i on the other she come smashing straight through the raft i could always stay under water a minute this time i reckon i stayed under a minute and a half
then i bounced for the top in a hurry for i was nearly busting i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose and puffed a bit
of course there was a booming current and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she was churning along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though i could hear her
i sung out for jim_tom_sawyer about a dozen time but i didnt get any answer so i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was treading water and struck out for shore shoving it ahead of me
but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left hand shore which meant that i was in a crossing so i changed off and went that way
it was one of these long slanting two mile crossings so i was a good long time in getting over i made a safe landing and clumb up the bank
i couldnt see but a little way but i went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then i run across a big old fashioned double log house before i noticed it
i was going to rush by and get away but a lot of dog jumped out and went to howling and barking at me and i knowed better than to move another peg
chapter xvii in about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out and says be done boy
who there i says it me who me george_jackson sir what do you want i dont want nothing sir
i only want to go along by but the dog wont let me what are you prowling around here this time of night for hey
i warnt prowling around sir i fell overboard off of the steamboat oh you did did you strike a light there somebody
what did you say your name was george_jackson sir i only a boy look here if you re telling the truth you neednt be afraid
nobody ll hurt you but dont try to budge stand right where you are rouse out bob and jim_tom_sawyer some of you and fetch the gun
george_jackson is there anybody with you no sir nobody i heard the people stirring around in the house now and see a light
the man sung out snatch that light away betsy you old fool aint you got any sense put it on the floor behind the front door
bob if you and jim_tom_sawyer are ready take your place all ready now george_jackson do you know the shepherdsons
no sir i never heard of them well that may be so and it maynt now all ready step forward george_jackson
and mind dont you hurry come mighty slow if there anybody with you let him keep back if he shows himself he ll be shot
come along now come slow push the door open yourself just enough to squeeze in you hear i didnt hurry i couldnt if i a wanted to
i took one slow step at a time and there warnt a sound only i thought i could hear my heart
the dog were as still as the humans but they followed a little behind me when i got to the three log doorsteps i heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting
i put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said there that enough put your head in
the candle was on the floor and there they all was looking at me and me at them for about a quarter of a minute
i done it but i judged they would take it off three big man with gun pointed at me which made me wince i tell you
the oldest gray and about sixty the other two thirty or more all of them fine and handsome and the sweetest old gray headed lady and back of her two young woman which i couldnt see right well
as soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it and told the young man to come in with their gun and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows there warnt none on the side
they held the candle and took a good look at me and all said why he aint a harney_shepherdson no there aint any harney_shepherdson about him
then the old man said he hoped i wouldnt mind being searched for arm because he didnt mean no harm by it it was only to make sure
the old gentleman says there i reckon it all right come in so he didnt pry into my pockets but only felt outside with his hand and said it was all right
he told me to make myself easy and at home and tell all about myself but the old lady says why bless you saul the poor thing as wet as he can be and dont you reckon it may be he hungry
so the old lady says betsy this was a nigger woman you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can poor thing and one of you girl go and wake up buck_harkness and tell him oh here he is himself
buck_harkness take this little stranger and get the wet clothe off from him and dress him up in some of yours that dry
true for you rachel i forgot buck_harkness looked about as old as me thirteen or fourteen or along there though he was a little bigger than me
he came in gaping and digging one fist into his eye and he was dragging a gun along with the other one
he hadnt on anything but a shirt and he was very frowzy headed he says aint they no shepherdsons around they said no twas a false alarm
well he says if they a ben some i reckon i a got one they all laughed and bob says why buck_harkness they might have scalped us all you ve been so slow in coming
never mind buck_harkness my boy says the old man you ll have show enough all in good time dont you fret about that
well nobody come after me and it aint right i always kept down i dont get no show go long with you now and do as your mother told you
when we got up stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his and i put them on
while i was at it he asked me what my name was but before i could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the wood day before yesterday and he asked me where moses was when the candle went out
i said i didnt know i hadnt heard about it before no way well guess he says
how i going to guess says i when i never heard tell of it before but you can guess cant you
it just as easy which candle i says why any candle he says i dont know where he was says i where was he
why he was in the dark that where he was well if you knowed where he was what did you ask me for
why blame it it a riddle dont you see say how long are you going to stay here you got to stay always
we can just have booming time they dont have no school now do you own a dog i ve got a dog and he ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in
do you like to comb up sundays and all that kind of foolishness you bet i dont but ma she makes me
confound these ole britches i reckon i better put em on but i ruther not it so warm are you all ready
all right come along old hoss cold corn pone cold corn beef butter and buttermilk that is what they had for me down there and there aint nothing better that ever i ve come across yet
buck_harkness and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes except the nigger woman which was gone and the two young woman
they all smoked and talked and i eat and talked the young woman had quilts around them and their hair down their back
they all asked me questions and i told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw and my sister miss_mary_jane ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more and bill went to hunt them and
nobody but just me and pap left and he was just trimmed down to nothing on account of his trouble so when he died i took what there was left because the farm didnt belong to us and started up the river deck passage and fell overboard and that was how i come to be here
he warnt heard of no more and jim_tom_sawyer and mort died and then there warnt so they said i could have a home there as long as i wanted it
then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed and i went to bed with buck_harkness and when i waked up in the morning drat it all i had forgot what my name was
so i laid there about an hour trying to think and when buck_harkness waked up i says can you spell buck_harkness
yes he says i bet you cant spell my name says i i bet you what you dare i can says he
all right says i go ahead e r e a o there now he says well says i you done it but i didnt think you could
i set it down private because somebody might want me to spell it next and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i was used to it
it aint no slouch of a name to spell right off without studying it was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too
it didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden one with a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as house in town
there warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heaps of parlors in town has bed in them
there was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimes they wash them over with red water paint that they call spanish brown same as they do in town
i hadnt seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style they had big brass dog irons that could hold up a saw log
there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in the middle of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it
it was beautiful to hear that clock tick and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out
well there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy
by one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the other and when you pressed down on them they squeaked but didnt open their mouths nor look different nor interested
they wouldnt took any money for her they squeaked through underneath there was a couple of big wild turkey wing fans spread out behind those thing
on the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real one is but they warnt real because you could see where piece had got chipped off and showed the white chalk or whatever it was underneath
this table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red and blue spread eagle painted on it and a painted border all around
it come all the way from philadelphia they said there was some book too piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table
one was a big family bible full of pictures one was pilgrim progress about a man that left his family it didnt say why
i read considerable in it now and then the statements was interesting but tough another was friendship offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but i didnt read the poetry
another was henry clay speeches and another was dr gunn family medicine which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead
and there was nice split bottom chairs and perfectly sound too not bagged down in the middle and busted like an old basket
they had pictures hung on the walls mainly washingtons and lafayettes and battles and highland marys and one called signing the declaration
there was some that they called crayons which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen year old
there was a hymn book and a lot of other book they was different from any pictures i ever see before blacker mostly than is common
one was a woman in a slim black dress belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves and a large black scoop shovel bonnet with a black veil and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape and very wee black slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule and underneath the picture it said shall
all combed up straight to the top of her head and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair back and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up and underneath the picture it said i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas
there was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon and tears running down her cheeks and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth and underneath the picture it said and art
i never see thee more alas another one was a young lady with her hair thou gone yes thou art gone alas
these was all nice pictures i reckon but i didnt somehow seem to take to them because if ever i was down a little they always give me the fan tods
everybody was sorry she died because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost
she was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done but she never got the chance
it was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off with her hair all down her back and looking up to the moon with the tears running down her face and she had two arm folded across her breast and two arm stretched out in front and two more reaching up towards the moon and the idea was to see which pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arm but as i was saying she died before she got her mind made up and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it
but i reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard other time it was hid with a little curtain
the young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face but there was so many arm it made her look too spidery seemed to me
this young girl kept a scrap book when she was alive and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the presbyterian observer and write poetry after them out of her own head
this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drownded ode to stephen dowling bots dec and did young stephen sicken and did young stephen die
no such was not the fate of young stephen dowling bots though sad hearts round him thickened twas not from sickness shots
no whooping cough did rack his frame nor measles drear with spots not these impaired the sacred name of stephen dowling bots
it was very good poetry and did the sad hearts thicken and did the mourners cry despised love struck not with woe
that head of curly knots nor stomach trouble laid him low young stephen dowling bots no then list with tearful eye whilst i his fate do tell
they got him out and emptied him alas it was too late his spirit was gone for to sport aloft in the realms of the good and great
if emmeline grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen there aint no telling what she could a done by and by
his soul did from this cold world fly by falling down a well buck_harkness said she could rattle off poetry like nothing
he said she would slap down a line and if she couldnt find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one and go ahead
she didnt ever have to stop to think she warnt particular she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful
every time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be on hand with her tribute before he was cold
the neighbors said it was the doctor first then emmeline then the undertaker the undertaker never got in ahead of emmeline but once and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person name which was whistler
she called them tributes she warnt ever the same after that she never complained but she kinder pined away and did not live long
poor thing many the time i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me
and i had soured on her a little i liked all that family dead one and all and warnt going to let anything come between us
poor emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobody to make some about her
now she was gone so i tried to sweat out a verse or two myself but i couldnt seem to make it go somehow
they kept emmeline room trim and nice and all the thing fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there
the old lady took care of the room herself though there was plenty of nigger and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible there mostly
well as i was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains on the windows white with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls and cattle coming down to drink
there was a little old piano too that had tin pans in it i reckon and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing the last link is broken and play the battle of prague on it
the walls of all the room was plastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside
it was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day and it was a cool comfortable place
nothing couldnt be better and warnt the cooking good and just bushels of it too chapter xviii col grangerford was a gentleman you see
he was well born as the saying is and that worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the widow douglas said and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town and pap he always said it too though he warnt no more quality than a mudcat himself
col grangerford was very tall and very slim and had a darkish paly complexion not a sign of red in it anywheres he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face and he had the thinnest kind of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils and a high nose and heavy eyebrows and the blackest kind of eye sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you as you may say
he was a gentleman all over and so was his family his forehead was high and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders
his hand was long and thin and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen
so white it hurt your eye to look at it and on sundays he wore a blue tail coat with brass buttons on it
he carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it there warnt no frivolishness about him not a bit and he warnt ever loud
sometimes he smiled and it was good to see but when he straightened himself up like a liberty pole and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows you wanted to climb a tree first and find out what the matter was afterwards
he was as kind as he could be you could feel that you know and so you had confidence he didnt ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners everybody was always good mannered where he was
everybody loved to have him around too he was sunshine most always i mean he made it seem like good weather
when he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute and that was enough there wouldnt nothing go wrong again for a week
when him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good day and didnt set down again till they had set down
then jim_tom_sawyer and bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him and he held it in his hand and waited till jim_tom_sawyer and bob was mixed and then they bowed and said our duty to you sir and madam and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drank all three and
bob and jim_tom_sawyer poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers and give it to me and buck_harkness and we drank to the old people too
bob was the oldest and jim_tom_sawyer next tall beautiful man with very broad shoulders and brown face and long black hair and black eye
then there was miss charlotte she was twenty five and tall and proud and grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stirred up but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks like her father
they dressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and wore broad panama hats she was beautiful
so was her sister miss sophia but it was a different kind she was gentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twenty
my nigger had a monstrous easy time because i warnt used to having anybody do anything for me but buck_harkness was on the jump most of the time
this was all there was of the family now but there used to be more three sons they got killed and emmeline that died
each person had their own nigger to wait on them buck_harkness too the old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred nigger
sometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten or fifteen mile around and stay five or six day and have such junketings round about and on the river and dances and picnics in the wood daytimes and balls at the house night
these people was mostly kinfolks of the family the man brought their gun with them it was a handsome lot of quality i tell you
there was another clan of aristocracy around there five or six family mostly of the name of harney_shepherdson they was as high toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerfords
the shepherdsons and grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which was about two mile above our house so sometimes when i went up there with a lot of our folks i used to see a lot of the shepherdsons there on their fine horse
one day buck_harkness and me was away out in the wood hunting and heard a horse coming we was crossing the road
buck_harkness says quick jump for the wood we done it and then peeped down the wood through the leaves pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier
he had his gun across his pommel i had seen him before it was young harney_shepherdson i heard buck_harkness gun go off at my ear and harney_shepherdson hat tumbled off from his head
he grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid but we didnt wait we started through the wood on a run
so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet and twice i seen harney_shepherdson cover buck_harkness with his gun and then he rode away the way he come to get his hat i reckon but i couldnt see
the old gentleman eye blazed a minute twas pleasure mainly i judged then his face sort of smoothed down and he says kind of gentle i dont like that shooting from behind a bush
the wood warnt thick we never stopped running till we got home why didnt you step into the road my boy
miss charlotte she held her head up like a queen while buck_harkness was telling his tale and her nostrils spread and her eye snapped
the shepherdsons dont father they always take advantage the two young man looked dark but never said nothing miss sophia she turned pale but the color come back when she found the man warnt hurt
soon as i could get buck_harkness down by the corn cribs under the tree by ourselves i says did you want to kill him buck_harkness
well i bet i did what did he do to you him he never done nothing to me
well then what did you want to kill him for why nothing only it on account of the feud
what a feud why where was you raised dont you know what a feud is never heard of it before tell me about it
well says buck_harkness a feud is this way a man has a quarrel with another man and kills him then that other man brother kills him then the other brothers on both side goes for one another then the cousins chip in and by and by
everybody killed off and there aint no more feud but it kind of slow and takes a long time has this one been going on long buck_harkness
there was trouble bout something and then a lawsuit to settle it and the suit went agin one of the man and
well i should reckon it started thirty year ago or som ers along there so he up and shot the man that won the suit which he would naturally do of course
anybody would what was the trouble about buck_harkness land i reckon maybe i dont know well who done the shooting
was it a grangerford or a harney_shepherdson laws how do i know it was so long ago dont anybody know
oh yes pa knows i reckon and some of the other old people but they dont know now what the row was about in the first place
has there been many killed buck_harkness yes right smart chance of funerals but they dont always kill pa got a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it
cuz he dont weigh much anyway bob been carved up some with a bowie and jim_tom_sawyer been hurt once or twice
bout three months ago my cousin bud fourteen year old was riding through the wood ont other side of the river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blame foolishness and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a coming behind him and sees old baldy harney_shepherdson a linkin after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a flying in the wind and stead of jumping off and taking to the brush bud lowed he could out run him so they had it nip and tuck for five mile or more the old man a gaining all the time so at last bud seen it warnt any use so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front you know and the old man he rode up and shot him down
has anybody been killed this year buck_harkness yes we got one and they got one but he didnt git much chance to enjoy his luck for inside of a week our folks laid him out
i reckon that old man was a coward buck_harkness i reckon he warnt a coward not by a blame sight
why that old man kep up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three grangerfords and come out winner
they was all a horseback he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile and kep his horse before him to stop the bullets but the grangerfords stayed on their horse and capered around the old man and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them
him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but the grangerfords had to be fetched home and one of em was dead and another died the next day
no sir if a body out hunting for cowards he dont want to fool away any time amongst them shepherdsons becuz they dont breed any of that kind
there aint a coward amongst them shepherdsons not a one and there aint no cowards amongst the grangerfords either next sunday we all went to church about three mile everybody a horseback
the man took their gun along so did buck_harkness and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall
it was pretty ornery preaching all about brotherly love and such like tiresomeness but everybody said it was a good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good work and free grace and preforeordestination and i dont know what all that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest
the shepherdsons done the same sundays i had run across yet about an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in their chairs and some in their room and it got to be pretty dull
buck_harkness and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep i went up to our room and judged i would take a nap myself
i found that sweet miss sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if i liked her and
i said i did and she asked me if i would do something for her and not tell anybody and i said i would
then she said she forgot her testament and left it in the seat at church between two other book and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not say nothing to nobody
i said i would so i slid out and slipped off up the road and there warnt anybody at the church except maybe a hog or two for there
warnt any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer time because it cool if you notice most folks dont go to church only when they ve got to but a hog is different
says i to myself something up it aint natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament
so i give it a shake and out drops a little piece of paper with half past two wrote on it with a pencil
i couldnt make anything out of that so i put the paper in the book again and when i got home
she pulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the testament till she found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze and said i was the best boy in the world and not to tell anybody
she was mighty red in the face for a minute and her eye lighted up and it made her powerful pretty
i was a good deal astonished but when i got my breath i asked her what the paper was about and she asked me if i had read it and
i said no and she asked me if i could read writing and i told her no only coarse hand and then she said the paper warnt anything but a book mark to keep her place and i might go and play now
i went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty soon i noticed that my nigger was following along behind
when we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comes a running and says mars jawge if you ll come down into de swamp i ll show you a whole stack water moccasins
i ransacked it but couldnt find anything else and upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me
thinks i that mighty curious he said that yesterday he oughter know a body dont love water moccasins enough to go around hunting for them
i followed a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp and waded ankle deep as much as another half mile
we come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with tree and bushes and vines and he says you shove right in dah jist a few steps mars jawge dah whah dey is
what is he up to anyway so i says all right trot ahead i seed befo i dont yer to see em no mo
then he slopped right along and went away and pretty soon the tree hid him i poked into the place a way and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom
i waked him up and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again but
all hung around with vines and found a man laying there asleep and by jings it was my old jim_tom_sawyer it warnt
said he swum along behind me that night and heard me yell every time but dasnt answer because he didnt want nobody to pick him up and take him into slavery again

if anything happens he aint mixed up in it he can say he never seen us together and it ll be the truth
i waked up about dawn and was a going to turn over and go to sleep again when i noticed how still it was didnt seem to be anybody stirring
i dont want to talk much about the next day i reckon i ll cut it pretty short that warnt usual
next i noticed that buck_harkness was up and gone well i gets up a wondering and goes down stairs nobody around everything as still as a mouse
just the same outside thinks i what does it mean down by the wood pile i comes across my jack and says what it all about

un dah i reck en you bet you he ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst i took up the river road as hard as i could put
when i come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboat lands i worked along under the tree and brush till i got to a good place and then i clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach and watched
there was a wood rank four foot high a little way in front of the tree and first i was going to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier
there was four or five man cavorting around on their horse in the open place before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood rank alongside of the steamboat landing but they couldnt come it
by and by i begin to hear gun a good way off i didnt every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at
the two boy was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watch both way by and by the man stopped cavorting around and yelling
they started riding towards the store then up gets one of the boy draws a steady bead over the wood rank and drops one of them out of his saddle
all the man jumped off of their horse and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store and that minute the two boy started on the run
they got half way to the tree i was in before the man noticed then the man see them and jumped on their horse and took out after them
they gained on the boy but it didnt do no good the boy had too good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree and slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the man again
one of the boy was buck_harkness and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen year old the man ripped around awhile and then rode away
as soon as they was out of sight i sung out to buck_harkness and told him he didnt know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first
he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the man come in sight again said they was up to some devilment or other
he was awful surprised wouldnt be gone long i wished i was out of that tree but i dasnt come down
buck_harkness begun to cry and rip and lowed that him and his cousin joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet
he said his father and his two brothers was killed and two or three of the enemy said the shepherdsons laid for them in ambush
buck_harkness said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations the shepherdsons was too strong for them i asked him what was become of young harney_shepherdson and miss sophia
i was glad of that but the way buck_harkness did take on because he didnt manage to kill harney_shepherdson that day he shot at him i haint ever heard anything like it
he said they got across the river and was safe all of a sudden bang bang bang goes three or four gun the man had slipped around through the wood and come in from behind without their horse
the boy jumped for the river both of them hurt and as they swum down the current the man run along the bank shooting at them and singing out kill them kill them
it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree i aint a going to tell all that happened it would make me sick again if i was to do that
i wished i hadnt ever come ashore that night to see such thing i aint ever going to get shut of them
lot of time i dream about them i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down
sometimes i heard gun away off in the wood and twice i seen little gangs of man gallop past the log store with gun so i reckoned the trouble was still a going on
i was mighty downhearted so i made up my mind i wouldnt ever go anear that house again because i reckoned i was to blame somehow
i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss sophia was to meet harney_shepherdson somewheres at half past two and run off and i judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful mess wouldnt ever happened
when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piece and found the two body laying in the edge of the water and tugged at them till i got them ashore then i covered up their face and got away as quick as i could
i cried a little when i was covering up buck_harkness face for he was mighty good to me it was just dark now
jim_tom_sawyer warnt on his island so i tramped off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willows red hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country
i never went near the house but struck through the wood and made for the swamp the raft was gone my souls but i was scared
i couldnt get my breath for most a minute then i raised a yell a voice not twenty five foot from me says good lan
is dat you honey doan make no noise it was jim_tom_sawyer voice nothing ever sounded so good before i run along the bank a piece and got aboard and jim_tom_sawyer he grabbed me and hugged me
he was so glad to see me he says laws bless you chile i uz right down sho you dead agin
so i jes dis minute a startin de raf down towards de mouf er de crick so to be all ready for to shove out
jack been heah he say he reck you ben shot kase you didn come home no mo en leave soon as jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead
i says all right that mighty good they wont find me and they ll think i ve been killed and floated down the river there something up there that ll help them think so
so dont you lose no time jim_tom_sawyer but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can
lawsy i mighty glad to git you back again honey i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the mississippi
i hadnt had a bite to eat since yesterday so jim_tom_sawyer he got out some corn dodgers and buttermilk and pork and cabbage and greens
there aint nothing in the world so good when it cooked right and whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a good time
then we hung up our signal lantern and judged that we was free and safe once more i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so was jim_tom_sawyer to get away from the swamp
we said there warnt no home like a raft after all other place do seem so cramped up and smothery but a raft dont
you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft chapter xix two or three day and night went by
i reckon i might say they swum by they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely here is the way we put in the time
it was a monstrous big river down there sometimes a mile and a half wide we run night and laid up and hid daytimes soon as night was most gone
we stopped navigating and tied up nearly always in the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods and willows and hid the raft with them
next we slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep and watched the daylight come
then we set out the line not a sound anywheres perfectly still just like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogs a cluttering maybe
the first thing to see looking away over the water was a kind of dull line that was the wood ont other side you couldnt make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then more paleness spreading around then the river softened up away off and warnt black any more but gray you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away trading scows and such thing and long black streaks raft sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking or jumbled up voices it was so still and sounds come so far and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the east reddens up and the river and you make out a log cabin in the edge of the wood away on the bank ont other side of the river being a woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up and comes fanning you from over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the wood and the flowers but sometimes not that way because they ve left dead fish laying around gars and such and they do get pretty rank and next you ve got the full day and everything smiling in the sun and the song birds just going it
a little smoke couldnt be noticed now so we would take some fish off of the line and cook up a hot breakfast
and afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and by lazy off to sleep
wake up by and by and look to see what done it and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up stream so far off towards the other side you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern wheel or side wheel then for about an hour there wouldnt be nothing to hear nor nothing to see just solid lonesomeness
next you see a raft sliding by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on it chopping because they re most always doing it on a raft you see the axe flash and come down
you dont hear nothing you see that axe go up again and by the time it above the man head then you hear the chunk
it had took all that time to come over the water so we would put in the day lazying around listening to the stillness
once there was a thick fog and the raft and thing that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboat wouldnt run over them
a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing heard them plain but we couldnt see no sign of them it made you feel crawly it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air
soon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wanted her to then we lit the pipes and dangled our leg in the water and talked about all kind of thing we was always naked day and night whenever the mosquitoes would let us the new clothe buck_harkness folks made for me was too good to be comfortable and besides i didnt go much on clothe nohow
jim_tom_sawyer said he believed it was spirits but i says no spirits wouldnt say dern the dern fog sometimes we have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time
yonder was the bank and the island across the water and maybe a spark which was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two on a raft or a scow you know and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts
we had the sky up there all speckled with stars and we used to lay on our back and look up at them and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened
jim_tom_sawyer he allowed they was made but i allowed they happened i judged it would have took too long to make so many
jim_tom_sawyer said the moon could a laid them well that looked kind of reasonable so i didnt say nothing against it because i ve seen a frog lay most as many
it lovely to live on a raft so of course it could be done we used to watch the stars that fell too and see them streak down
once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty then she would turn a corner and her light would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by her waves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle the raft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear nothing for you couldnt tell how long except maybe frogs or something
jim_tom_sawyer allowed they got spoiled and was hove out of the nest after midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two or three hour the shore was black
these sparks was our clock the first one that showed again meant morning was coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away
one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore it was only two hundred yards and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress wood to see if i couldnt get some berries
just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick here comes a couple of man tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it
no more sparks in the cabin windows i thought i was a goner for whenever anybody was after anybody i judged it was me
i was about to dig out from there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sung out and begged me to save their lives said they hadnt been doing nothing and was being chased for it
or maybe jim_tom_sawyer said there was man and dog a coming they wanted to jump right in but i says dont you do it
i dont hear the dog and horse yet you ve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little way then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in
i lit out for our towhead and in about five or ten minute we heard the dog and the man away off shouting
we heard them come along towards the crick but couldnt see them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we got further and further away all the time we couldnt hardly hear them at all by the time we had left a mile of wood behind us and struck the river everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe
that ll throw the dog off the scent they done it and soon as they was aboard one of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald head and very gray whiskers
he had an old battered up slouch hat on and a greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot tops and home knit galluses no he only had one
he had an old long tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm and both of them had big fat ratty looking carpet bags
after breakfast we all laid off and talked and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didnt know one another
the other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery what got you into trouble says the baldhead tot other chap
well i been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth and it does take it off too and generly the enamel along with it but i stayed about one night longer than i ought to and was just in the act of sliding out when i ran across you on the trail this side of town and you told me they were coming and begged me to help you to get off
so i told you i was expecting trouble myself and would scatter out with you that the whole yarn what yourn
well i ben a running a little temperance revival thar bout a week and was the pet of the woman folks big and little for i was makin it mighty warm for the rummies i tell you and takin as much as five or six dollar a night ten cents a head children and nigger free and business a growin all the time when somehow or another a little report got around last night that i had a way of puttin in my time with a private jug on the sly
a nigger rousted me out this mornin and told me the people was getherin on the quiet with their dog and horse and they be along pretty soon and give me bout half an hour start and then run me down if they could and if they got me
they tar and feather me and ride me on a rail sure i didnt wait for no breakfast i warnt hungry
old man said the young one i reckon we might double team it together what do you think i aint undisposed what your line mainly
jour printer by trade do a little in patent medicines theater actor tragedy you know take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there a chance teach singing geography school for a change sling a lecture sometimes
oh i do lot of thing most anything that comes handy so it aint work what your lay i ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time
layin on hand is my best holt for cancer and paralysis and sich thing and i n tell a fortune pretty good when i ve got somebody along to find out the facts for me
preachin my line too and workin camp meetin and missionaryin around nobody never said anything for a while then the young man hove a sigh and says alas
what re you alassin about says the bald head to think i should have lived to be leading such a life and be degraded down into such company
and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag dern your skin aint the company good enough for you says the baldhead pretty pert and uppish
yes it is good enough for me it as good as i deserve for who fetched me so low when i was so high
i did myself i dont blame you gentleman far from it i dont blame anybody i deserve it all let the cold world do its worst one thing i know there a grave somewhere for me
the world may go on just as it always done and take everything from me loved one property everything but it cant take that
some day i ll lie down in it and forget it all and my poor broken heart will be at rest
he went on a wiping drot your pore broken heart says the baldhead what are you heaving your pore broken heart at us r
we haint done nothing no i know you havent i aint blaming you gentleman i brought myself down yes i did it myself
it right i should suffer perfectly right i dont make any moan brought you down from whar whar was you brought down from
ah you would not believe me the world never believes let it pass tis no matter the secret of my birth the secret of your birth
gentleman says the young man very solemn i will reveal it to you for i feel i may have confidence in you
do you mean to say by rights i am a duke jim_tom_sawyer eye bugged out when he heard that and i reckon mine did too
my great grandfather eldest son of the duke of bridgewater fled to this country about the end of the last century to breathe the pure air of freedom married here and died leaving a son his own father dying about the same time
then the baldhead says no you cant mean it yes the second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates the infant real duke was ignored
i am the lineal descendant of that infant i am the rightful duke of bridgewater and here am i forlorn torn from my high estate hunted of man despised by the cold world ragged worn heart broken and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft
we tried to comfort him but he said it warnt much use he couldnt be much comforted said if we was a mind to acknowledge him that would do him more good than most anything else so we said we would if he would tell us how
he said we ought to bow when we spoke to him and say your grace or my lord or your lordship and he wouldnt mind it if we called him plain bridgewater which he said was a title anyway and not a name and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner and do any little thing for him he wanted done
all through dinner jim_tom_sawyer stood around and waited on him and says will yo grace have some dis or some dat
jim_tom_sawyer pitied him ever so much and so did i well that was all easy so we done it and so on and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him
didnt have much to say and didnt look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke
so along in the afternoon he says looky here bilgewater he says i nation sorry for you but you aint the only person that had trouble like that
but the old man got pretty silent by and by he seemed to have something on his mind no no you aint
you aint the only person that ben snaked down wrongfully out a high place alas no you aint the only person that had a secret of his birth
and by jings he begins to cry hold what do you mean bilgewater kin i trust you says the old man still sort of sobbing
to the bitter death he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it and says that secret of your being speak
bilgewater i am the late dauphin you bet you jim_tom_sawyer and me stared this time then the duke says you are what
yes my friend it is too true your eye is lookin at this very moment on the pore disappeared dauphin looy the seventeen son of looy the sixteen and marry antonette
you at your age no you mean you re the late charlemagne you must be six or seven hundred year old at the very least
yes gentleman you see before you in blue jeans and misery the wanderin exiled trampled on and sufferin rightful king of france
trouble has done it bilgewater trouble has done it trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude
well he cried and took on so that me and jim_tom_sawyer didnt know hardly what to do we was so sorry and so glad and proud
we got him with us too so we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comfort him
could do him any good though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights and got down on one knee to speak to him and always called him your majesty and waited on him first at meals and didnt set down in his presence till he asked them
so jim_tom_sawyer and me set to majestying him and doing this and that andt other for him and standing up till he told us we might set down
but he said it warnt no use nothing but to be dead and done with it all this done him heaps of good and so he got cheerful and comfortable
but the duke kind of soured on him and didnt look a bit satisfied with the way thing was going still the king acted real friendly towards him and said the duke great grandfather and all the other duke of bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father and was allowed to come to the palace considerable but the duke stayed huffy a good while till by and by the king says like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this yer raft bilgewater and so what the use
your bein sour it ll only make thing oncomfortable it aint my fault i warnt born a duke it aint your fault
you warnt born a king so what the use to worry make the best thing the way you find em says i that my motto
this aint no bad thing that we ve struck here plenty grub and an easy life come give us your hand duke and le all
it took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft for what you want above all thing on a raft is for everybody to be satisfied and feel right and kind towards the others
be friends the duke done it and jim_tom_sawyer and me was pretty glad to see it it didnt take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn t
but i never said nothing never let on kept it to myself it the best way then you dont have no quarrels and dont get into no trouble
if they wanted us to call them king and duke i hadnt no objections long as it would keep peace in the family and it warnt no use to tell jim_tom_sawyer
if i never learnt nothing else out of pap i learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way
they asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead of running was jim_tom_sawyer a runaway nigger
no king nor duke at all but just low down humbugs and frauds so i didnt tell him chapter xx says i goodness sakes
would a runaway nigger run south no they allowed he wouldnt i had to account for thing some way so
i says my folks was living in pike county in missouri where i was born and they all died off but
pa he lowed he break up and go down and live with uncle ben who got a little one horse place on the river forty four mile below orleans
pa was pretty poor and had some debts so when he squared up there warnt nothing left but sixteen dollar and our nigger jim_tom_sawyer
me and pa and my brother ike that warnt enough to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way
well when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketched this piece of a raft so we reckoned we go down to orleans on it
pa luck didnt hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel jim_tom_sawyer and me come up all right but pa was drunk and ike was only four year old so they never come up no more
well for the next day or two we had considerable trouble because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take jim_tom_sawyer away from me saying they believed he was a runaway nigger
the duke says leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to
we dont run daytimes no more now night they dont bother us i ll think the thing over i ll invent a plan that ll fix it
we ll let it alone for to day because of course we dont want to go by that town yonder in daylight it mightnt be healthy
towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves was beginning to shiver it was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to see that
my bed was a straw tick better than jim_tom_sawyer which was a corn shuck tick there always cobs around about in a shuck tick and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves it makes such a rustling that you wake up
so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to see what the bed was like well the duke allowed he would take my bed but the king allowed he wouldnt
he says i should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn shuck bed warnt just fitten for me to sleep on
jim_tom_sawyer and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad when the duke says tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression
your grace ll take the shuck bed yourself misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit i yield i submit tis my fate
i am alone in the world let me suffer can bear it we got away as soon as it was good and dark
the king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till we got a long way below the town
we come in sight of the little bunch of light by and by that was the town you know and slid by about a half a mile out all right
it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night
it was my watch below till twelve but i wouldnt a turned in anyway if i had a bed because a body dont see such a storm as that every day in the week not by a long sight
when we was three quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern and about ten clock my souls how the wind did scream along
and every second or two there come a glare that lit up the white caps for a half a mile around and you see the island looking dusty through the rain and the tree thrashing around in the wind then comes a whack bum bum
bumble umble um bum bum bum bum and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away and quit and then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes but i hadnt any clothe on and didnt mind
we didnt have no trouble about snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them
i had the middle watch you know but i was pretty sleepy by that time so jim_tom_sawyer he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was always mighty good that way
jim_tom_sawyer was i crawled into the wigwam but the king and the duke had their leg sprawled around so there warn t
so i laid outside i didnt mind the rain because it was warm and the waves warnt running so high now
about two they come up again though and jim_tom_sawyer was going to call me but he changed his mind because he reckoned they warnt high enough yet to do any harm but he was mistaken about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard
i took the watch and jim_tom_sawyer he laid down and snored away and by and by the storm let up for good and all and the first cabin light that showed i rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day
the king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and him and the duke played seven up a while five cents a game
no show for me it most killed jim_tom_sawyer a laughing he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anyway then they got tired of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they called it
the duke went down into his carpet bag and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud
one bill said the celebrated dr armand de montalban of paris would lecture on the science of phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day of blank at ten cents admission and furnish charts of character at twenty five cents apiece
the duke said that was him in another bill he was the world renowned shakespearian tragedian garrick the younger of drury lane london
in other bills he had a lot of other name and done other wonderful thing like finding water and gold with a divining rod dissipating witch spells and so on
by and by he says but the histrionic muse is the darling have you ever trod the boards royalty
the first good town we come to we ll hire a hall and do the sword fight in richard iii and the balcony scene in romeo and juliet
no says the king you shall then before you re three day older fallen grandeur says the duke how does that strike you
i in up to the hub for anything that will pay bilgewater but you see i dont know nothing about play actin and haint ever seen much of it
i was too small when pap used to have em at the palace do you reckon you can learn me easy
so the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was and said he was used to being romeo so the king could be juliet
but if juliet such a young gal duke my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin to look oncommon odd on her maybe
all right i jist a freezn for something fresh anyway le commence right away no dont you worry these country jakes wont ever think of that
besides you know you ll be in costume and that makes all the difference in the world juliet in a balcony enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed and she got on her night gown and her ruffled nightcap
he got out two or three curtain calico suits which he said was meedyevil armor for richard iii andt other chap and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match
the king was satisfied so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread eagle way prancing around and acting at the same time to show how it had got to be done then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart
there was a little one horse town about three mile down the bend and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for jim_tom_sawyer so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing
here are the costumes for the parts the king allowed he would go too and see if he couldnt strike something
we was out of coffee so jim_tom_sawyer said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some when we got there there
we found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard and he said everybody that warnt too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp meeting about two mile back in the wood
the king got the directions and allowed he go and work that camp meeting for all it was worth and i might go too
warnt nobody stirring streets empty and perfectly dead and still like sunday the duke said what he was after was a printing office
we found it a little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shop carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting and no door locked
it was a dirty littered up place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures of horse and runaway nigger on them all over the walls
the duke shed his coat and said he was all right now so me and the king lit out for the camp meeting
we got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a most awful hot day there was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around
the wood was full of teams and wagons hitched everywheres feeding out of the wagon troughs and stomping to keep off the flies
there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles of watermelons and green corn and such like truck
the benches was made out of outside slabs of log with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for leg
the preaching was going on under the same kind of sheds only they was bigger and held crowds of people they didnt have no back
the woman had on sun bonnets and some had linsey woolsey frocks some gingham one and a few of the young one had on calico
some of the young man was barefooted and some of the children didnt have on any clothe but just a tow linen shirt
the preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds some of the old woman was knitting and some of the young folks was courting on the sly
he lined out two line everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear it there was so many of them
and they done it in such a rousing way then he lined out two more for them to sing and so on
the people woke up more and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end some begun to groan and some begun to shout
then the preacher begun to preach and begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side of the platform
the first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn and then the other and then a leaning down over the front of it with
his arm and his body going all the time and shouting his word out with all his might and every now and then he would hold up his bible and spread it open and kind of pass it around this way and that shouting it the brazen serpent in the wilderness
look upon it and live and people would shout out glory a a man and so he went on and the people groaning and crying and saying amen
oh come to the mourners bench come black with sin amen come sick and sore amen come lame and halt and blind
amen come pore and needy sunk in shame a a man come all that worn and soiled and suffering come with a broken spirit
come with a contrite heart come in your rags and sin and dirt the water that cleanse is free the door of heaven stands open oh enter in and be at rest
a a man glory glory hallelujah and so on you couldnt make out what the preacher said any more on account of the shouting and crying
folks got up everywheres in the crowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners bench with the tears running down their face and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wild
well the first i knowed the king got a going and you could hear him over everybody and next he went a charging up on to the platform and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it
he told them he was a pirate been a pirate for thirty year out in the indian ocean and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight and he was home now to take out some fresh man and thanks to goodness he been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent and he was glad of it
it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy for the first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to start right off and work his way back to the indian ocean and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he could do it better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean and though it would take him a long time to get there without money he would get there anyway and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him dont you thank me dont you give me no credit it all belongs to them dear people in pokeville camp meeting natural brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacher there the truest friend a pirate ever had
and then he busted into tears and so did everybody then somebody sings out take up a collection for him take up a collection
well a half a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out let him pass the hat around
so the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eye and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while the prettiest kind of girl with the tears running down their cheeks would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and he always done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six time and he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him to live in their house and said they think it was an honor but he said as this was the last day of the camp meeting
he couldnt do no good and besides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to work on the pirates
when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty seven dollar and seventy five cents
and then he had fetched away a three gallon jug of whisky too that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the wood
then everybody said it the preacher too the king said take it all around it laid over any day he ever put in in the missionarying line
the duke was thinking he been doing pretty well till the king come to show up but after that he didnt think so so much
he had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing office horse bills and took the money four dollar
and he had got in ten dollar worth of advertisements for the paper which he said he would put in for four dollar if they would pay in advance so they done it
the price of the paper was two dollar a year but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it and was going to run it for cash
he set up a little piece of poetry which he made himself out of his own head three verses kind of sweet and saddish the name of it was yes crush cold world this breaking heart and
he said it warnt no use talking heathens dont amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp meeting with he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper and didnt charge nothing for it
well he took in nine dollar and a half and said he done a pretty square day work for it then he showed us another little job he printed and hadnt charged for because it was for us
it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder and reward under it
it said he run away from st jacques plantation forty mile below new orleans last winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and send him back
the reading was all about jim_tom_sawyer and just described him to a dot he could have the reward and expenses
whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim_tom_sawyer hand and foot with a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboat so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward
handcuffs and chains would look still better on jim_tom_sawyer but it wouldnt go well with the story of us being so poor
now says the duke after to night we can run in the daytime if we want to too much like jewelry ropes are the correct thing we must preserve the unities as we say on the boards
we judged we could make mile enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke work in the printing office was going to make in that little town then we could boom right along if we wanted to
we laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly ten clock then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didnt hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it
when jim_tom_sawyer called me to take the watch at four in the morning he says huck_creeps does you reck we gwyne to run acrost any mo king on dis trip
we all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldnt be no trouble about running daytimes no i says i reckon not
well says he dat all right den i doan mine one er two king but dat enough dis one powerful drunk en de duke ain much better
i found jim_tom_sawyer had been trying to get him to talk french so he could hear what it was like but he said he had been in this country so long and had so much trouble he forgot it
the king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but after they jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal
after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his leg dangle in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and went to getting his romeo and juliet by heart
chapter xxi it was after sun up now but we went right on and didnt tie up when he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together
the duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech and he made him sigh and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he done it pretty well only he says you mustnt bellow out romeo
that way like a bull you must say it soft and sick and languishy so o meo that is the idea for juliet a dear sweet mere child of a girl you know and
well next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths and begun to practice the sword fight the duke called himself richard iii and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see
but by and by the king tripped and fell overboard and after that they took a rest and had a talk about all kind of adventures they had in other time along the river
after dinner the duke says well capet we ll want to make this a first class show you know so i guess we ll add a little more to it
she doesnt bray like a jackass we want a little something to answer encores with anyway what onkores bilgewater
the duke told him and then says i ll answer by doing the highland fling or the sailor hornpipe and you well let me see
oh i ve got it you can do hamlet soliloquy hamlet which hamlet soliloquy you know the most celebrated thing in shakespeare
ah it sublime sublime always fetches the house i havent got it in the book i ve only got one volume but i reckon i can piece it out from memory
so he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horrible every now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan next he would sigh and next he let on to drop a tear
i ll just walk up and down a minute and see if i can call it back from recollection vaults it was beautiful to see him
then he strikes a most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and his arm stretched away up and his head tilted back looking up at the sky and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after that all through his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up his chest and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before
this is the speech i learned it easy enough while he was learning it to the king to be or not to be that is the bare bodkin that makes calamity of so long life for who would fardels bear till birnam wood do come to dunsinane but that the fear of something after death murders the innocent sleep great nature second course and makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune than fly to others that we know not of
by and by he got it he told us to give attention there the respect must give us pause wake duncan with thy knocking
i would thou couldst for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor wrong the proud man contumely the law delay and
in the dead waste and middle of the night when churchyards yawn in customary suits of solemn black but that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns breathes forth contagion on the world and thus the native hue of resolution like the poor cat
and all the clouds that lowered er our housetops with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action
the quietus which his pangs might take i the adage is sicklied er with care tis a consummation devoutly to be wished
well the old man he liked that speech and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate
it seemed like he was just born for it and when he had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off
the first chance we got the duke he had some show bills printed and after that for two or three day as we floated along the raft was a most uncommon lively place for there warnt nothing but sword fighting and rehearsing as the duke called it going on all the time
one morning when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw we come in sight of a little one horse town in a big bend so we tied up about three quarters of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress tree and all of us
but jim_tom_sawyer took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show
we struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there that afternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in in all kind of old shackly wagons and on horse
but soft you the fair ophelia ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws but get thee to a nunnery mdash go the circus would leave before night so our show would have a pretty good chance
the duke he hired the court house and we went around and stuck up our bills they read like this shaksperean revival
the world renowned tragedians david garrick the younger of drury lane theatre london and edmund kean the elder of the royal haymarket theatre whitechapel pudding lane piccadilly london and the royal continental theatres in their sublime shaksperean spectacle entitled the balcony scene in romeo and juliet
wonderful attraction for one night only romeo mr garrick juliet mr kean assisted by the whole strength of the company new costumes new scenery new appointments
also the thrilling masterly and blood curdling broad sword conflict in richard iii richard iii mr garrick richmond mr kean also by special request
hamlet immortal soliloquy by the illustrious kean done by him consecutive night in paris for one night only on account of imperative european engagements
the stores and house was most all old shackly dried up frame concerns that hadnt ever been painted they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed
the house had little gardens around them but they didnt seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds and sunflowers and ash piles and old curled up boots and shoes and piece of bottles and rags and played out tin ware
the fences was made of different kind of boards nailed on at different time and they leaned every which way and had gates that didnt generly have but one hinge a leather one
some of the fences had been whitewashed some time or another but the duke said it was in clumbus time like enough
admission cents children and servants cents then we went loafing around the town there was generly hogs in the garden and people driving them out
all the stores was along one street they had white domestic awnings in front and the country people hitched their horse to the awning posts
there was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roosting on them all day long whittling them with their barlow knives and chawing tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretching a mighty ornery lot
they generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella but didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another bill and buck_harkness and hank and joe and andy and talked lazy and drawly and used considerable many cuss word
there was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning post and he most always had his hand in his britches pockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch
what a body was hearing amongst them all the time was gimme a chaw tobacker hank caint i haint got but one chaw left
some of them kind of loafers never has a cent in the world nor a chaw of tobacco of their own
ask bill maybe bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he aint got none they get all their chawing by borrowing they say to a fellow i wisht you len
a lie pretty much everytime it dont fool nobody but a stranger but jack aint no stranger so he says you give him a chaw did you
me a chaw jack i jist this minute give ben thompson the last chaw i had which is so did your sister cat grandmother
you pay me back the chaws you ve awready borry off me lafe buckner then i ll loan you one or two ton of it and wont charge you no back intrust nuther
well i did pay you back some of it wunst yes you did bout six chaws you borry store tobacker and paid back nigger head
when they borrow a chaw they dont generly cut it off with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hand till they get it in two then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it handed back and says sarcastic here gimme the chaw and you take the plug
store tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted all the streets and lanes was just mud they warnt nothing else
but mud mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some place and two or three inches deep in all the place
you see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way where folks had to walk around her and she stretch out and shut her eye and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look as happy as if she was on salary
the hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres and pretty soon you hear a loafer sing out hi so boy sick him tige
and away the sow would go squealing most horrible with a dog or two swinging to each ear and three or four dozen more a coming and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise
there couldnt anything wake them up all over and make them happy all over like a dog fight unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death
on the river front some of the house was sticking out over the bank and they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in
then they settle back again till there was a dog fight the people had moved out of them the bank was caved away under one corner of some others and that corner was hanging over
people lived in them yet but it was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time
sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer
such a town as that has to be always moving back and back and back because the river always gnawing at it
the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horse in the streets and more coming all the time
family fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat them in the wagons there was considerable whisky drinking going on and i seen three fights
by and by somebody sings out here comes old boggs in from the country for his little old monthly drunk here he comes boy
all the loafers looked glad i reckoned they was used to having fun out of boggs one of them says wonder who he a gwyne to chaw up this time
if he a chawed up all the man he ben a gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he have considerable ruputation now
another one says i wisht old boggs threaten me cuz then i know i warnt gwyne to die for a thousan year
boggs comes a tearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like an injun and singing out cler the track thar
he was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty year old and had a very red face
everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him and he sassed back and said he attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns but he couldnt wait now because he come to town to kill old colonel sherburn and his motto was meat first and spoon vittles to top off on
i on the waw path and the price uv coffins is a gwyne to raise he see me and rode up and says whar you come m boy
you prepared to die then he rode on i was scared but a man says he dont mean nothing he always a carryin on like that when he drunk
boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells
he the best naturedest old fool in arkansaw never hurt nobody drunk nor sober come out here sherburn come out and meet the man you ve swindled
and so he went on calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on
by and by a proud looking man about fifty five and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town too steps out of the store and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come
you re the houn i after and i a gwyne to have you too he says to boggs mighty ca and slow he says i tired of this but i ll endure it till one clock
if you open your mouth against me only once after that time you cant travel so far but i will find you
till one clock mind no longer then he turns and goes in the crowd looked mighty sober nobody stirred and there warnt no more laughing
boggs rode off blackguarding sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store still keeping it up
some man crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up but he wouldnt they told him it would be one clock in about fifteen minute and so he must go home
he cussed away with all his might and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it and pretty soon away he went a raging down the street again with his gray hair a flying
everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober but it warnt no use up the street he would tear again and give sherburn another cussing
he must go right away but it didnt do no good by and by somebody says go for his daughter quick go for his daughter sometimes he ll listen to her
if anybody can persuade him she can so somebody started on a run i walked down street a way and stopped
he was a reeling across the street towards me bare headed with a friend on both side of him a holt of his arm and hurrying him along
in about five or ten minute here comes boggs again but not on his horse he was quiet and looked uneasy and he warnt hanging back any but was doing some of the hurrying himself
he was standing perfectly still in the street and had a pistol raised in his right hand not aiming it but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky
somebody sings out boggs i looked over there to see who said it and it was that colonel sherburn the same second i see a young girl coming on the run and two man with her
boggs and the man turned round to see who called him and when they see the pistol the man jumped to one side and the pistol barrel come down slow and steady to a level both barrels cocked
bang goes the first shot and he staggers back clawing at the air bang goes the second one and he tumbles backwards on to the ground heavy and solid with his arm spread out
that young girl screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on her father crying and saying oh he killed him he killed him
the crowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another with their necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting back back
boggs throws up both of his hand and says lord dont shoot give him air give him air colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turned around on his heels and walked off
they took boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around just the same and the whole town following and i rushed and got a good place at the window where i was close to him and could see in
they laid him on the floor and put one large bible under his head and opened another one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirt first and i seen where one of the bullets went in
he made about a dozen long gasps his breast lifting the bible up when he drawed in his breath and letting it down again when he breathed it out and after that he laid still he was dead
then they pulled his daughter away from him screaming and crying and took her off she was about sixteen and very sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scared
well pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but people that had the place wouldnt give them up and folks behind them was saying all the time say now you ve looked enough you fellows
taint right and taint fair for you to stay thar all the time and never give nobody a chance other folks has their rights as well as you
there was considerable jawing back so i slid out thinking maybe there was going to be trouble the streets was full and everybody was excited
everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows stretching their necks and listening
one long lanky man with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and a crooked handled cane marked out the place on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood and the people following him around from one place tot other and watching everything he done and bobbing their head to show they understood and stooping a little and resting their hand on their thighs to watch him mark the place on the ground with his cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood frowning and having his hat brim down over his eye and sung out boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and says bang
the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect said it was just exactly the way it all happened
staggered backwards says bang again and fell down flat on his back then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him
in about a minute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling and snatching down every clothe line they come to to do the hanging with
they swarmed up towards sherburn house a whooping and raging like injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush and it was awful to see
children was heeling it ahead of the mob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window along the road was full of woman head and there was nigger boy in every tree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach
well by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched chapter xxii lot of the woman and girl was crying and taking on scared most to death
they swarmed up in front of sherburn palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise
then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave
just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch with a double barrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly ca and deliberate not saying a word
it was a little twenty foot yard some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence the racket stopped and the wave sucked back
sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eye and looked sneaky
then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasant kind but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that got sand in it
sherburn never said a word just stood there looking down the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable then he says slow and scornful
the idea of you lynching anybody it amusing the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man
because you re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast out woman that come along here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hand on a man
why a man safe in the hand of ten thousand of your kind as long as it daytime and you re not behind him
i was born and raised in the south and i ve lived in the north so i know the average all around
in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it
in the south one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of man in the daytime and robbed the lot
your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people whereas you re just as brave and no braver
do i know you i know you clear through the average man a coward why dont your juries hang murderers
because they re afraid the man friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it just what they would do
so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal
your mistake is that you didnt bring a man with you that one mistake and the other is that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks
you brought part of a man buck_harkness there and if you hadnt had him to start you you a taken it out in blowing
you didnt want to come the average man dont like trouble and danger you dont like trouble and danger but if only half a man like buck_harkness there shouts lynch him
so you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that half a man coat tail and come raging up here swearing what big thing you re going to do
the pitifulest thing out is a mob that what an army is a mob they dont fight with courage that born in them but with courage that borrowed from their mass and from their officers
lynch him you re afraid to back down afraid you ll be found out to be what you are cowards and but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
if any real lynching going to be done it will be done in the dark southern fashion and when they come they ll bring their masks and fetch a man along
now leave and take your half a man with you tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck_harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap
now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didnt want to
i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by and then dived in under the tent
i had my twenty dollar gold piece and some other money but i reckoned i better save it because there aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home and amongst strangers that way
i aint opposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way but there aint no use in wasting it on them
it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by side the man just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor stirrups and resting their hand on their thighs easy and comfortable there must a been twenty of them and every lady with a lovely complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real sure enough queens and dressed in clothe that cost millions of dollar and just littered with diamonds
you cant be too careful it was a real bully circus it was a powerful fine sight i never see anything so lovely
and then one by one they got up and stood and went a weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the man looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their head bobbing and skimming along away up there under the tent roof and every lady rose leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking like the most loveliest parasol
and then the other the horse leaning more and more and the ringmaster going round and round the center pole cracking his whip and shouting hi hi and the clown cracking jokes behind him and by and by all hand dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arm and then how the horse did lean over and hump themselves
and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hand and went just about wild
and then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot out in the air well all through the circus they done the most astonishing thing and all the time that clown carried on
the ringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest thing a body ever said and how he ever could think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what i couldnt noway understand
and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring said he wanted to ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was
so it most killed the people why i couldnt a thought of them in a year they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole show come to a standstill
then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that stirred up the people and a lot of man begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring saying knock him down throw him out
so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse
and one or two woman begun to scream so everybody laughed and said all right and the man got on
the minute he was on the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus man hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down
and at last sure enough all the circus man could do the horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and thent other one ont other side and the people just crazy
but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle a reeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood
it warnt funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger and the horse a going like a house afire too
he just stood up there a sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warnt ever drunk in his life and then he begun to pull off his clothe and sling them
and then there he was slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum and finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off to the dressing room and everybody just a howling with pleasure and astonishment
then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see i reckon
he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits why it was one of his own man
well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldnt a been in that ringmaster place not for a thousand dollar
he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody i dont know there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but i never struck them yet
anyways it was plenty good enough for me and wherever i run across it it can have all of my custom every time
and they laughed all the time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the show was over but one boy which was asleep
so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to shakespeare what they wanted was low comedy and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he reckoned
well that night we had our show but there warnt only about twelve people there just enough to pay expenses he said he could size their style
so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over the village
well all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candle for footlights and that night the house was jam full of man in no time
when the place couldnt hold no more the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was and so he went on a bragging about the tragedy and about edmund kean the elder which was to play the main principal part in it and
at last when he got everybody expectations up high enough he rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come a prancing out on all fours naked and he was painted all over ring streaked and striped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow
the bills said chapter xxiii and but never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hawed till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time
then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says the great tragedy will be performed only two night more on accounts of pressing london engagements where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it
well it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut twenty people sings out what is it over
is that all the duke says yes then there was a fine time everybody sings out sold and rose up mad and was a going for that stage and them tragedians
but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on just a word gentleman they stopped to listen
but we dont want to be the laughing stock of this whole town i reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live
what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town
we are sold mighty badly sold no then we ll all be in the same boat aint that sensible you bet it is the jedge is right
everybody sings out all right then not a word about any sell go along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy
next day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was house was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the same way
when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper and by and by about midnight they made jim_tom_sawyer and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town
the third night the house was crammed again and they warnt new comers this time but people that was at the show the other two night
i stood by the duke at the door and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coat and i see it warn t
i smelt sickly eggs by the barrel and rotten cabbages and such thing and if i know the signs of a dead cat being around and i bet i do there was sixty four of them went in
no perfumery neither not by a long sight i shoved in there for a minute but it was too various for me i couldnt stand it
well when the place couldnt hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute and then he started around for the stage door i after him but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says walk fast now till you get away from the house and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you
we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river
i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam and says well how the old thing pan out this time duke
i done it and he done the same nobody saying a word he hadnt been up town at all we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village
then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they served them people
i knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in and i knew they lay for us the third night and consider it was their turn now
the duke says greenhorns flatheads well it is their turn and i give something to know how much they take for it
i would just like to know how they re putting in their opportunity they can turn it into a picnic if they want to they brought plenty provisions
them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty five dollar in that three night i never see money hauled in by the wagon load like that before
by and by when they was asleep and snoring jim_tom_sawyer says dont it prise you de way dem king carries on huck_creeps
no i says it dont why dont it huck_creeps well it dont because it in the breed
i reckon they re all alike but huck_creeps dese king ourn is reglar rapscallions dat jist what dey is dey reglar rapscallions
well that what i a saying all king is mostly rapscallions as fur as i can make out is dat so
and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old time and raise cain
you read about them once you ll see look at henry the eight this s a sunday school superintendent to him my you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom
he was a blossom he used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her head next morning and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs
fetch up nell gwynn he says they fetch her up next morning chop off her head and they chop it off
fetch up jane shore he says and up she comes next morning chop off her head and they chop it off
and he made every one of them tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and called it domesday book which was a good name and stated the case
you dont know king jim_tom_sawyer but i know them and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest i ve struck in history
ring up fair rosamun fair rosamun answers the bell next morning chop off her head well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of independence and dares them to come on
how does he go at it give notice give the country a show no that was his style he never give anybody a chance
he had suspicions of his father the duke of wellington well what did he do ask him to show up no drownded him in a butt of mamsey like a cat
s pose he contracted to do a thing and you paid him and didnt set down there and see that he done it
s pose people left money laying around where he was what did he do he collared it what did he do he always done the other thing
s pose he opened his mouth what then if he didnt shut it up powerful quick he lose a lie every time that the kind of a bug
henry was and if we a had him along stead of our king he a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done
i dont say that ourn is lambs because they aint when you come right down to the cold facts but they aint nothing to that old ram anyway
all i say is king is king and you got to make allowances take them all around they re a mighty ornery lot
it the way they re raised but dis one do smell so like de nation huck_creeps well they all do jim_tom_sawyer
we cant help the way a king smells history dont tell no way now de duke he a tolerble likely man in some way
yes a duke different but not very different this one a middling hard lot for a duke when he drunk there ain t
no near sighted man could tell him from a king well anyways i doan hanker for no mo un um huck_creeps
dese is all i kin stan it the way i feel too jim_tom_sawyer but we ve got them on our hand and we got to remember what they are and make allowances
sometimes i wish we could hear of a country that out of king what was the use to tell jim_tom_sawyer these warnt real king and duke
it wouldnt a done no good and besides it was just as i said you couldnt tell them from the real kind
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself
i went to sleep and jim_tom_sawyer didnt call me when it was my turn he often done that i didnt take notice nor let on
he was thinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was low and homesick because he hadnt ever been away from home before in his life and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for
he was often moaning and mourning that way night when he judged i was asleep and saying po little lizabeth po little johnny
i knowed what it was about their it dont seem natural but i reckon it so it mighty hard i spec i aint ever gwyne to see you no mo no mo
but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young one and by and by he says what makes me feel so bad dis time uz bekase i hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack er a slam while ago en it mine me er de time i treat my little lizabeth so ornery

next day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them town
jim_tom_sawyer he spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a few hour because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope
you see when we left him all alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldnt look much like he was a runaway nigger you know
so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day and he cipher out some way to get around it
he dressed jim_tom_sawyer up in king lear outfit it was a long curtain calico gown and a white horse hair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paint and painted jim_tom_sawyer face and hand and ears and neck all over a dead dull solid blue like a man that been drownded nine day
en i ben a treat her so chapter xxiv he was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it blamed if he warnt the horriblest looking outrage i ever see
then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so sick arab but harmless when not out of his head
and he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam
he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of year every day and trembling all over every time
the duke told him to make himself free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone
jim_tom_sawyer was satisfied there was a sound which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldnt wait for him to howl
these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again because there was so much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time
they couldnt hit no project that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned he lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldnt put up something on the arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would drop over tot other village without any plan but just trust in providence to lead him the profitable way meaning the devil i reckon
we had all bought store clothe where we stopped last and now the king put his on and he told me to put mine on
why he didnt only look like he was dead he looked considerable more than that i done it of course the king duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when he take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you say he had walked right out of the ark and maybe was old leviticus himself
i never knowed how clothe could change a body before jim_tom_sawyer cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready
there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point about three mile above the town been there a couple of hour taking on freight
says the king seein how i dressed i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st louis or cincinnati or some other big place
go for the steamboat huckleberry we ll come down to the village on her i didnt have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride
i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water
pretty soon we come to a nice innocent looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had a couple of big carpet bags by him
run her nose in shore says the king i done it wher you bound for young man for the steamboat going to orleans
git aboard says the king hold on a minute my servant ll he you with them bags jump out and he the gentleman adolphus meaning me i see
i done so and then we all three started on again the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather
he asked the king where he was going and the king told him he come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there
the young fellow says when i first see you i says to myself it mr wilks sure and he come mighty near getting here in time
but then i says again no i reckon it aint him or else he wouldnt be paddling up the river you aint him are you
no my name blodgett elexander blodgett reverend elexander blodgett i pose i must say as i one the lord poor servants
but still i jist as able to be sorry for mr wilks for not arriving in time all the same if he missed anything by it which i hope he hasnt
well he dont miss any property by it because he ll get that all right but he missed seeing his brother peter_wilks die which he maynt mind nobody can tell as to that but his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died
never talked about nothing else all these three weeks hadnt seen him since they was boy together and hadnt ever seen his brother william_fourth at all that the deef and dumb one
peter_wilks and george_jackson were the only one that come out here george_jackson was the married brother him and his wife both died last year
william_fourth aint more than thirty or thirty five uncle_harvey and william_fourth the only one that left now and as i was saying they havent got here in time
oh yes a month or two ago when peter_wilks was first took because peter_wilks said then that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well this time
you see he was pretty old and george_jackson g yirls was too young to be much company for him except miss_mary_jane the red headed one and so he was kinder lonesome after george_jackson and his wife died and didnt seem to care much to live
he most desperately wanted to see uncle_harvey and william_fourth too for that matter because he was one of them kind that cant bear to make a will
he left a letter behind for uncle_harvey and said he told in it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so george_jackson g yirls would be all right for george_jackson didnt leave nothing
did anybody send em word and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to
why do you reckon uncle_harvey dont come wher does he live oh he lives in england sheffield preaches there hasnt ever been in this country
he hasnt had any too much time and besides he mightnt a got the letter at all you know too bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soul
you going to orleans you say yes but that aint only a part of it i going in a ship next wednesday for ryo janeero where my uncle lives
it a pretty long journey but it ll be lovely wisht i was a going is miss_mary_jane the oldest how old is the others
miss_mary_jane nineteen susan fifteen and joanna about fourteen that the one that gives herself to good work and has a hare lip
poor thing to be left alone in the cold world so well they could be worse off old peter_wilks had friends and they aint going to let them come to no harm
there hobson the babtis preacher and deacon lot hovey and ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell the lawyer and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley and well there a lot of them but these are the one that peter_wilks was thickest with and used to write about sometimes when he wrote home
so uncle_harvey ll know where to look for friends when he gets here well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow
blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkses and about peter_wilks business which was a tanner and about george_jackson which was a carpenter and about uncle_harvey which was a dissentering minister and so on and so on
then he says what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for because she a big orleans boat and i was afeard
she mightnt stop there when they re deep they wont stop for a hail a cincinnati boat will but this is a st louis one
was peter_wilks well off oh yes pretty well off he had house and land and it reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash
hid up som ers when did you say he died i didnt say but it was last night funeral to morrow likely
yes bout the middle of the day well it all terrible sad but we ve all got to go one time or another
so what we want to do is to be prepared then we re all right yes sir it the best way
ma used to always say that when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off
when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lost my ride after all and if he gone over tot other side go over there and git him
and tell him to git himself up regardless shove along now i see what he was up to but i never said nothing of course
when i got back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log and the king told him everything just like the young fellow had said it every last word of it
and all the time he was a doing it he tried to talk like an englishman and he done it pretty well too for a slouch
i cant imitate him and so i aint a going to try to but he really done it pretty good then he says how are you on the deef and dumb bilgewater
the duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards
about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boat come along but they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last there was a big one and they hailed her
she sent out her yawl and we went aboard and she was from cincinnati and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and said they wouldnt land us
he says if gentleman kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em cant it
so they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore
about two dozen man flocked down when they see the yawl a coming and when the king says kin any of you gentleman tell me wher
they give a glance at one another and nodded their head as much as to say what i tell you
then one of them says kind of soft and gentle i sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening
sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his back and says alas alas our poor brother gone and we never got to see him oh it too too hard
then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hand and blamed if he didnt drop a carpet bag and bust out a crying
so then they waited for a steamboat but the king was ca mr peter_wilks lives if they warnt the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever i struck
well the man gathered around and sympathized with them and said all sorts of kind thing to them and carried their carpet bags up the hill for them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all about his brother last moments and the king he told it all over again on his hand to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they lost the twelve disciples
well if ever i struck anything like it i a nigger it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race
the news was all over town in two minute and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting on their coats as they come
pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march
chapter xxv the windows and dooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fence is it them
when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and the three girl was standing in the door
miss_mary_jane was red headed but that dont make no difference she was most awful beautiful and her face and her eye was all lit up like glory
and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say you bet it is she was so glad her uncles was come
the king he spread his arm and miss_mary_jane she jumped for them and the hare lip jumped for the duke and there they had it
then the king he hunched the duke private i see him do it and then he looked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs so then him and the duke with a hand across each other shoulder andt other hand to their eye walked slow and solemn over there everybody dropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stopping people saying sh and all the man taking their hats off and drooping their head so you could a heard a pin fall
and when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and then they bust out a crying
so you could a heard them to orleans most and then they put their arm around each other necks and hung their chins over each other shoulders and then for three minute or maybe four i never see two man leak the way they done
everybody most leastways woman cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good time and mind you everybody was doing the same and the place was that damp i never see anything like it
then one of them got on one side of the coffin andt other ont other side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and let on to pray all to themselves
well when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud the poor girl too and every woman nearly went up to the girl without saying a word and kissed them solemn on the forehead and then put their hand on their head and looked up towards the sky with the tears running down and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing and give the next woman a show
well by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little and work himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile but it a trial that sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother heart because out of their mouths they cant word being too weak and cold and all that kind of rot and slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbers out a pious goody goody amen and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust
and the minute the word were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all their might and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out
i never see anything so disgusting music is a good thing and after all that soul butter and hogwash i never see it freshen up thing so and sound so honest and bully
then the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening and help set up with the ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name for they was name that was very dear to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he will name the same to wit as follows vizz rev
mr hobson and deacon lot hovey and mr ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley
that is i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man tot other world and the preacher was pinting him right
rev hobson and dr robinson was down to the end of the town a hunting together lawyer bell was away up to louisville on business
but the rest was on hand and so they all come and shook hand with the king and thanked him and talked to him and then they shook hand with the duke and didnt say nothing but just kept a smiling and bobbing their head like a passel of sapheads
whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hand and said goo goo goo goo goo all the time like a baby that cant talk
so the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sorts of little thing that happened one time or another in the town or to george_jackson family or to peter_wilks
and he always let on that peter_wilks wrote him the thing but that was a lie he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat
then miss_mary_jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and the king he read it out loud and cried over it
it give the dwelling house and three thousand dollar gold to the girl and it give the tanyard which was doing a good business along with some other house and land worth about seven thousand and three thousand dollar in gold to uncle_harvey and william_fourth and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar
so these two frauds said they go and fetch it up and have everything square and above board and told me to come with a candle
we shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all them yaller boy
my the way the king eye did shine he slaps the duke on the shoulder and says oh this aint bully nor noth
they pawed the yaller boy and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and the king says it aint no use talkin bein brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that got left is the line for you and me bilge
oh no i reckon not why bully it beats the nonesuch dont it the duke allowed it did thish yer comes of trust to providence
it the best way in the long run i ve tried em all and ther aint no better way most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it on trust but no they must count it
so they counts it and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollar short says the king dern him i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollar
they worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it then the duke says well he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistake
i reckon that the way of it the best way to let it go and keep still about it we can spare it
oh shucks yes we can spare it i dont yer noth bout that it the count i thinkin about we want to be awful square and open and above board here you know
but when the dead man says ther six thous dollar you know we dont want to hold on says the duke
we want to lug this yer money up stairs and count it before everybody then ther aint noth suspicious le make up the deffisit and he begun to haul out yaller boy out of his pocket
blest if the old nonesuch aint a heppin us out agin and he begun to haul out yaller jackets and stack them up
it a most amaz good idea duke you have got a rattlin clever head on you says the king it most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clear
say says the duke i got another idea le go up stairs and count this money and then take and give it to the girl
good land duke lemme hug you it the most dazzling idea at ever a man struck you have cert nly got the most astonishin head i ever see
oh this is the boss dodge ther aint no mistake bout it let em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to this ll lay em out
when we got up stairs everybody gethered around the table and the king he counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollar in a pile twenty elegant little piles
then they raked it into the bag again and i see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech
he says friends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that left behind in the vale of sorrers
he has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and that left fatherless and motherless
yes and we that knowed him knows that he would a done more generous by em if he hadnt ben afeard woundin his dear william_fourth and me
everybody looked hungry at it and licked their chops now wouldnt he ther aint no question bout it in my mind
well then what kind brothers would it be that stand in his way at sech a time and what kind uncles would it be that rob yes
rob sech poor sweet lambs as these at he loved so at sech a time if i know william_fourth and i think i do he well i ll jest ask him
he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hand and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather headed a while then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning and jumps for the king goo gooing with all his might for joy and hugs him about fifteen time before he lets up
then the king says i knowed it i reckon that ll convince anybody the way he feels about it here miss_mary_jane susan joanner take the money take it all
miss_mary_jane she went for him susan and the hare lip went for the duke and then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet
and everybody crowded up with the tears in their eye and most shook the hand off of them frauds saying all the time you dear good souls how lovely
well then pretty soon all hand got to talking about the diseased again and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that and before long a big iron jawed man worked himself in there from outside and stood a listening and looking and not saying anything and nobody saying anything to him either because the king was talking
it the gift of him that lays yonder cold but joyful how could you and they was all busy listening
the king was saying in the middle of something he started in on they bein partickler friends the diseased that why they re invited here this evenin but tomorrow we want all to come everybody
and so he went a mooning on and on liking to hear himself talk and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the duke he couldnt stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paper obsequies you old fool and folds it up and goes to goo gooing and reaching it over people head to him
the king he reads it and puts it in his pocket and says poor william_fourth afflicted as he is his heart aluz right
for he respected everybody he liked everybody and so it fitten that his funeral orgies sh be public asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral wants me to make em all welcome
but he neednt a worried it was jest what i was at then he weaves along again perfectly ca and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now
and when he done it the third time he says i say orgies not because it the common term because it aint obsequies bein the common term but because orgies is the right term
and then just like he done before obsequies aint used in england no more now it gone out we say orgies now in england
it a word that made up out the greek orgo outside open abroad and the hebrew jeesum to plant cover up hence in ter
orgies is better because it means the thing you re after more exact so you see funeral orgies is an open er public funeral
he was the worst i ever struck well the iron jawed man he laughed right in his face everybody was shocked
everybody says why doctor and abner shackleford says why robinson haint you heard the news this is uncle_harvey wilks
the king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and says is it my poor brother dear good friend and physician i
keep your hand off of me says the doctor you talk like an englishman dont you it the worst imitation i ever heard
they crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how uncle_harvey showed in forty way that he was uncle_harvey and knowed everybody by name and the name of the very dog and begged and begged him not to hurt uncle_harvey feelings and the poor girl feelings and all that
but it warnt no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretended to be an englishman and couldnt imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar
the poor girl was hanging to the king and crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them
he says i was your father friend and i your friend and i warn you as a friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble to turn your back on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic greek and hebrew as he calls it
he is the thinnest kind of an impostor has come here with a lot of empty name and facts which he picked up somewheres and you take them for proofs and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here who ought to know better
you peter_wilks brother you re a fraud that what you are well how they all took on miss_mary_jane wilks you know me for your friend and for your unselfish friend too
now listen to me turn this pitiful rascal out i beg you to do it will you miss_mary_jane straightened herself up and my but she was handsome
she hove up the bag of money and put it in the king hand and says take this six thousand dollar and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to and dont give us no receipt for it
then she put her arm around the king on one side and susan and the hare lip done the same on the other
everybody clapped their hand and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud
she says here is my answer the doctor says all right i wash my hand of the matter
but i warn you all that a time coming when you re going to feel sick whenever you think of this day
kinder mocking him we ll try and get em to send for you which made them all laugh and they said it was a prime good hit
when they was all gone the king he asks miss_mary_jane how they was off for spare room and she said she had one spare room which would do for uncle william_fourth and she give her own room to uncle_harvey which was a little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it
and away he went all right doctor says the king chapter xxvi well the king said the cubby would do for his valley meaning me
she said she have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in uncle_harvey way but he said they warnt
the frocks was hung along the wall and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor
there was an old hair trunk in one corner and a guitar box in another and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girl brisken up a room with
so miss_mary_jane took us up and she showed them their room which was plain but nice the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings and so dont disturb them
that night they had a big supper and all them man and woman was there and i stood behind the king and the duke chairs and waited on them and the nigger waited on the rest
miss_mary_jane she set at the head of the table with susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuits was and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was and all that kind of rot the way woman always do for to force out compliments and the people all knowed everything was tiptop and said so said how do you get biscuits to brown so nice and where for the land sake did you get these amaz pickles and all that kind of humbug talky talk just the way people always does at a supper you know
and when it was all done me and the hare lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings whilst the others was helping the nigger clean up the thing
the hare lip she got to pumping me about england and blest if i didnt think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes
the duke room was pretty small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby she says did you ever see the king
who william_fourth well i bet i have he goes to our church i knowed he was dead year ago but i never let on
so when i says he goes to our church she says what regular yes regular his pew right over opposite ourn ont other side the pulpit
i thought he lived in london well he does where would he live but i thought you lived in sheffield
i had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone so as to get time to think how to get down again
i see i was up a stump then i says i mean he goes to our church regular when he in sheffield
that only in the summer time when he comes there to take the sea baths why how you talk sheffield aint on the sea
well who said it was why you did i didnt nuther you did i didnt you did
i never said nothing of the kind well what did you say then said he come to take the sea baths
that what i said well then how he going to take the sea baths if it aint on the sea
looky here i says did you ever see any congress water yes well did you have to go to congress to get it
why no well neither does william_fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath how does he get it then
gets it the way people down here gets congress water in barrels there in the palace at sheffield they ve got furnaces and he wants his water hot
they cant bile that amount of water away off there at the sea they havent got no conveniences for it
oh i see now you might a said that in the first place and saved time when she said that i see i was out of the wood again and so i was comfortable and glad
next she says do you go to church too yes regular where do you set why in our pew
whose pew why ourn your uncle_harvey his what does he want with a pew wants it to set in
what did you reckon he wanted with it why i thought he be in the pulpit rot him i forgot he was a preacher
i see i was up a stump again so i played another chicken bone and got another think then i says blame it do you suppose there aint but one preacher to a church
why what do they want with more what to preach before a king i never did see such a girl as you
they dont have no less than seventeen seventeen my land why i wouldnt set out such a string as that not if i never got to glory
it must take em a week shucks they dont all of em preach the same day only one of em well then what does the rest of em do
oh nothing much loll around pass the plate and one thing or another but mainly they dont do nothing
well then what are they for why they re for style dont you know nothing well i dont want to know no such foolishness as that
how is servants treated in england do they treat em better we treat our nigger no a servant aint nobody there
they treat them worse than dog dont they give em holidays the way we do christmas and new year week and fourth of july
why hare why joanna they never see a holiday from year end to year end never go to the circus nor theater nor nigger shows nor nowheres
oh just listen a body could tell you haint ever been to england by that nor church nor church
but you always went to church well i was gone up again i forgot i was the old man servant
but next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not and set with the family on account of its being the law
but i didnt do it pretty good and when i got done i see she warnt satisfied she says honest injun now haint you been telling me a lot of lies
honest injun says i none of it at all none of it at all not a lie in it says i lay your hand on this book and say it
so then she looked a little better satisfied and says well then i ll believe some of it but i hope to gracious if i ll believe the rest
i see it warnt nothing but a dictionary so i laid my hand on it and said it
it aint right nor kind for you to talk so to him and him a stranger and so far from his people
what is it you wont believe joe says miss_mary_jane stepping in with susan behind her how would you like to be treated so
he told some stretchers i reckon and i said i wouldnt swallow it all and that every bit and grain i did say
that always your way maim always sailing in to help somebody before they re hurt i haint done nothing to him i reckon he can stand a little thing like that cant he
i dont care whether twas little or whether twas big he here in our house and a stranger and it wasnt good of you to say it
if you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtnt to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed
the thing is for you to treat him kind and not be saying thing to make him remember he aint in his own country and amongst his own folks
why mam he said it dont make no difference what he said that aint the thing i says to myself this is a girl that i letting that old reptile rob her of her money
then susan she waltzed in and if you ll believe me she did give hare lip hark from the tomb says i to myself and this is another one that i letting him rob her of her money
then miss_mary_jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovely again which was her way but when she got done there warnt hardly anything left poor hare lip
so she hollered all right then says the other girl you just ask his pardon she done it too and she done it beautiful
she done it so beautiful it was good to hear and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies so she could do it again
and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends
i felt so ornery and low down and mean that i says to myself my mind made up i ll hive that money for them or bust
i says to myself this is another one that i letting him rob her of her money so then i lit out for bed i said meaning some time or another
when i got by myself i went to thinking the thing over i says to myself shall i go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds
no that wont do he might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it warm for me
her face would give them a hint sure they ve got the money and they slide right out and get away with it
if she was to fetch in help i get mixed up in the business before it was done with i judge
i got to steal that money somehow and i got to steal it some way that they wont suspicion that i done it
they ve got a good thing here and they aint a going to leave till they ve played this family and this town for all they re worth so i ll find a chance time enough
i ll steal it and hide it and by and by when i away down the river i ll write a letter and tell miss_mary_jane where it hid
but i better hive it tonight if i can because the doctor maybe hasnt let up as much as he lets on he has he might scare them out of here yet
shall i go private and tell miss_mary_jane no i dasnt do it no there aint no good way but one so thinks i i ll go and search them room
upstairs the hall was dark but i found the duke room and started to paw around it with my hand but i recollected it wouldnt be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self so then i went to his room and begun to paw around there
but i see i couldnt do nothing without a candle and i dasnt light one of course so i judged i got to do the other thing lay for them and eavesdrop
about that time i hears their footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed i reached for it but it wasnt where i thought it would be but i touched the curtain that hid miss_mary_jane frocks so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still
they come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed
then i was glad i hadnt found the bed when i wanted it and yet you know it kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private
they sets down then and the king says well what is it and cut it middlin short because it better for us to be down there
a whoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a chance to talk us over well this is it capet
i aint easy i aint comfortable that doctor lays on my mind i wanted to know your plans i ve got a notion and i think it a sound one
that we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clip it down the river with what we ve got
specially seeing we got it so easy given back to us flung at our head as you may say when of course we allowed to have to steal it back
about an hour or two ago it would a been a little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed the king rips out and says what
what is it duke i for knocking off and lighting out that made me feel pretty bad and not sell out the rest the property
march off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous dollar worth property layin around jest sufferin to be scooped in and all good salable stuff too
the duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didnt want to go no deeper didnt want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had
why how you talk says the king we sha nt rob em of nothing at all but jest this money
the people that buys the property is the suff rers because as soon it found out at we didnt own it which wont be long after we ve slid the sale wont be valid and it ll all go back to the estate
these yer orphans ll git their house back agin and that enough for them they re young and spry and n easy earn a livin
they aint a goin to suffer why jest think there thous s and thous s that aint nigh so well off bless you they aint got noth to complain of
well the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said all right but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and that doctor hanging over them
but the king says cuss the doctor what do we yer for him haint we got all the fools in town on our side
and aint that a big enough majority in any town so they got ready to go down stairs again the duke says i dont think we put that money in a good place
that cheered me up i begun to think i warnt going to get a hint of no kind to help me
because miss_mary_jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you know the nigger that does up the room will get an order to box these duds up and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it
the king says why your head level agin duke says the king and he comes a fumbling under the curtain
i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still though quivery and i wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me and i tried to think what i better do if they did catch me
but the king he got the bag before i could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicioned i was around
they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather bed and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger only makes up the feather bed and dont turn over the straw tick only about twice a year and
two or three foot from where i was so it warnt in no danger of getting stole now but i knowed better
i had it out of there before they was half way down stairs i groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till i could get a chance to do better
i judged i better hide it outside of the house somewheres because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking i knowed that very well
then i turned in with my clothe all on but i couldnt a gone to sleep if i a wanted to i was in such a sweat to get through with the business
by and by i heard the king and the duke come up so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen
so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early one hadnt begun yet and then i slipped down the ladder
but nothing did chapter xxvii i crept to their door and listened they was snoring so i tiptoed along and got down stairs all right
i peeped through a crack of the dining room door and see the man that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs
there warnt a sound anywheres the door was open into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was a candle in both room
but the remainders of peter_wilks so i shoved on by but the front door was locked and the key wasnt there
i passed along and the parlor door was open but i see there warnt nobody in there just then i heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me
i run in the parlor and took a swift look around and the only place i see to hide the bag was in the coffin
the lid was shoved along about a foot showing the dead man face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his shroud on
i tucked the money bag in under the lid just down beyond where his hand was crossed which made me creep they was so cold and then i run back across the room and in behind the door
she went to the coffin very soft and kneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and i see she begun to cry though i couldnt hear her and her back was to me
the person coming was miss_mary_jane i slid out and as i passed the dining room i thought i make sure them watchers hadnt seen me
i slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thing playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it
says i if it could stay where it is all right because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to miss_mary_jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint the thing that going to happen the thing that going to happen is the money ll be found when they come to screw on the lid
then the king ll get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him
so i looked through the crack and everything was all right they hadnt stirred of course i wanted to slide down and get it out of there but i dasnt try it
every minute it was getting earlier now and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir and i might get catched catched with six thousand dollar in my hand that nobody hadnt hired me to take care of
i dont wish to be mixed up in no such business as that i says to myself when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and the watchers was gone
there warnt nobody around but the family and the widow bartley and our tribe i watched their face to see if anything had been happening but i couldnt tell
towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and then set all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining room was full
i see the coffin lid was the way it was before but i dasnt go to look in under it with folks around
then the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girl took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at the dead man face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it was all very still and solemn only the girl and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eye and keeping their head bent and sobbing a little
the scraping of the foot on the floor and blowing noses because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other place except church
when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering way putting on the last touches and getting people and thing all ship shape and comfortable and making no more sound than a cat
he never spoke he moved people around he squeezed in late one he opened up passageways and done it with nods and signs with his hand
he was the softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see and there warnt no more smile to him than there is to a ham
they had borrowed a melodeum a sick one and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky and colicky and everybody joined in and sung and peter_wilks was the only one that had a good thing according to my notion
then the reverend hobson opened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was only one dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up right along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and wait you couldnt hear yourself think
there warnt no other sound but then he took his place over against the wall it was right down awkward and nobody didnt seem to know what to do
but pretty soon they see that long legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say dont you worry just depend on me
so he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two side of the room he disappears down cellar
then in about two seconds we heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off
in a minute or two here comes this undertaker back and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided and glided around three side of the room and then rose up and shaded his mouth with his hand and stretched his neck out towards the preacher over the people head and says in a kind of a coarse whisper he had a rat
then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the people head
then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people because naturally they wanted to know
a little thing like that dont cost nothing and it just the little thing that makes a man to be looked up to and liked
well the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage and at last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw driver
there warnt no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was i was in a sweat then and watched him pretty keen
but he never meddled at all just slid the lid along as soft as mush and screwed it down tight and fast
so says i pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly now how do i know whether to write to miss_mary_jane or not
so there i was i didnt know whether the money was in there or not pose she dug him up and didnt find nothing
blame it i says i might get hunted up and jailed i better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the thing awful mixed now trying to better it i ve worsened it a hundred time and i wish to goodness
what would she think of me i just let it alone dad fetch the whole business they buried him and we come back home and i went to watching face again
the king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody up and made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that his congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home
i couldnt help it and i couldnt rest easy but nothing come of it the face didnt tell me nothing he was very sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody
and he said of course him and william_fourth would take the girl home with them and that pleased everybody too because then the girl would be well fixed and amongst their own relations and it pleased the girl too tickled them
so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready
them poor thing was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so but i didnt see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune
well blamed if the king didnt bill the house and the nigger and all the property for auction straight off sale two day after the funeral but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to
they wished he could stay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done so the next day after the funeral along about noon time the girl joy got the first jolt
a couple of nigger traders come along and the king sold them the nigger reasonable for three day drafts as they called it and away they went the two sons up the river to memphis and their mother down the river to orleans
i thought them poor girl and them nigger would break their hearts for grief they cried around each other and took on so it most made me down sick to see it
i cant ever get it out of my memory the sight of them poor miserable girl and nigger hanging around each other necks and crying and i reckon i couldnt a stood it all but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadnt knowed the sale warn t
the girl said they hadnt ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town no account and
the thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way
it injured the frauds some but the old fool he bulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and i tell you the duke was powerful uneasy
about broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their look that there was trouble
the nigger would be back home in a week or two next day was auction day the king says was you in my room night before last
no your majesty which was the way i always called him when nobody but our gang warnt around was you in there yisterday er last night
no your majesty honor bright now no lies honor bright your majesty i telling you the truth i haint been a near your room since miss_mary_jane took you and the duke and showed it to you
the duke says have you seen anybody else go in there no your grace not as i remember i believe
stop and think i studied awhile and see my chance then i says well i see the nigger go in there several time
both of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadnt ever expected it and then like they had
then the duke says what all of them no leastways not all at once that is i dont think i ever see them all come out at once but just one time
hello when was that it was the day we had the funeral in the morning it warnt early because i overslept
i was just starting down the ladder and i see them well go on go on what did they do
they tiptoed away so i seen easy enough that they shoved in there to do up your majesty room or something posing you was up and found you warnt up and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked you up
how they act they didnt do nothing and they didnt act anyway much as fur as i see great gun this is a go says the king and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly
they stood there a thinking and scratching their head a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle and says it does beat all how neat the nigger played their hand
they let on to be sorry they was going out of this region and i believed they was sorry and so did you and so did everybody
dont ever tell me any more that a nigger aint got any histrionic talent why the way they played that thing it would fool anybody
if i had capital and a theater i wouldnt want a better lay out than that and here we ve gone and sold em for a song
in my opinion there a fortune in em yes and aint privileged to sing the song yet say where is that song that draft
in the bank for to be collected where would it be well that all right then thank goodness says i
kind of timid like is something gone wrong the king whirls on me and rips out none your business you keep your head shet and mind r own affairs if you got any
long as you re in this town dont you forgit that you hear then he says to the duke we got to jest swaller it and say noth
mum the word for us as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again and says quick sales and small profits
the king snarls around on him and says i was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick
it a good business yes if the profits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none to carry is it my fault
any more it yourn well they be in this house yet and we wouldnt if i could a got my advice listened to
the king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swapped around and lit into me again
he give me down the bank for not coming and telling him i see the nigger come out of his room acting that way said any fool would a knowed something was up
and then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning
and he be blamed if he ever do it again so they went off a jawing and i felt dreadful glad i worked it all off on to the nigger and yet hadnt done the nigger no harm by it
so i come down the ladder and started for down stairs but as i come to the girl room the door was open and i see miss_mary_jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and she been packing thing in it getting ready to go to england
chapter xxviii by and by it was getting up time but she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in her hand crying
i went in there and says miss_mary_jane you cant a bear to see people in trouble and i cant most always
i felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would tell me about it so she done it and it was the nigger i just expected it
she said the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her she didnt know how she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother and the children warnt ever going to see each other no more and then busted out bitterer than ever and flung up her hand and says oh dear dear to think they aint ever going to see each other any more
but they will and inside of two weeks and i know it says i laws it was out before i could think
and before i could budge she throws her arm around my neck and told me to say it again say it again say it again
i asked her to let me think a minute and she set there very impatient and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy and eased up like a person that had a tooth pulled out
i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a close place so i went to studying it out
i says to myself i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks though i aint had no experience and cant say for certain but it looks so to me anyway and yet here a case where i blest if it dont look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie
i must lay it by in my mind and think it over some time or other it so kind of strange and unregular
i a going to chance it i ll up and tell the truth this time though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you ll go to
then i says miss_mary_jane is there any place out of town a little way where you could go and stay three or four day
i never see nothing like it well i says to myself at last yes mr lothrop why never mind why yet
if i ll tell you how i know the nigger will see each other again inside of two weeks here in this house and prove how i know it will you go to mr lothrop and stay four day
all right i says i dont want nothing more out of you than just your word i druther have it than another man kiss the bible
she smiled and reddened up very sweet and i says if you dont mind it i ll shut the door and bolt it
four day she says i ll stay a year then i come back and set down again and says dont you holler
i got to tell the truth and you want to brace up miss_mary_jane because it a bad kind and going to be hard to take but there aint no help for it
just set still and take it like a man these uncles of yourn aint no uncles at all they re a couple of frauds regular dead beats
it jolted her up like everything of course but i was over the shoal water now so i went right along her eye a blazing higher and higher all the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where she flung herself on to the king breast at the front door
there now we re over the worst of it you can stand the rest middling easy and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen time
and then up she jumps with her face afire like sunset and says the brute come dont waste a minute not a second we ll
have them tarred and feathered and flung in the river says i cert nly but do you mean before you go to mr lothrop or
oh she says what am i thinking about she says and set right down again dont mind what i said please dont you wont now will you
laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that i said i would die first
i never thought i was so stirred up she says now go on and i wont do so any more you tell me what to do and whatever you say i ll do it
well i says it a rough gang them two frauds and i fixed so i got to travel with them a while longer whether i want to or not
i druther not tell you why and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws and i be all right but there be another person that you dont know about who be in big trouble
well we got to save him haint we of course well then we wont blow on them saying them word put a good idea in my head
i see how maybe i could get me and jim_tom_sawyer rid of the frauds get them jailed here and then leave
but i didnt want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me so i didnt want the plan to begin working till pretty late to night
i says miss_mary_jane i ll tell you what we ll do and you wont have to stay at mr lothrop so long nuther
how fur is it a little short of four mile right out in the country back here well that ll answer
now you go along out there and lay low till nine or half past to night and then get them to fetch you home again tell them you ve thought of something
if you get here before eleven put a candle in this window and if i dont turn up wait till eleven and then if i dont turn up it means i gone and out of the way and safe
then you come out and spread the news around and get these beats jailed good she says i ll do it
and if it just happens so that i dont get away but get took up along with them you must up and say i told you the whole thing beforehand and you must stand by me all you can
stand by you indeed i will they sha nt touch a hair of your head she says and i see her nostrils spread and her eye snap when she said it too
if i get away i sha nt be here i says to prove these rapscallions aint your uncles and i couldnt do it if i was here
can do that better than what i can and they re people that aint going to be doubted as quick as i be
i could swear they was beats and bummers that all though that worth something well there others i ll tell you how to find them
when the court wants to find out something about these two let them send up to bricksville and say they ve got the man that played the royal nonesuch and ask for some witnesses why you ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink miss_mary_jane
gimme a pencil and a piece of paper there royal nonesuch bricksville put it away and dont lose it and they ll come a biling too
i judged we had got everything fixed about right now so i says just let the auction go right along and dont worry
nobody dont have to pay for the thing they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice and they aint going out of this till they get that money and the way we ve fixed it
the sale aint going to count and they aint going to get no money it just like the way it was with the nigger
it warnt no sale and the nigger will be back before long why they cant collect the money for the nigger yet
they re in the worst kind of a fix miss_mary_jane well she says i ll run down to breakfast now and then i ll start straight for mr lothrop
deed that aint the ticket miss_mary_jane i says by no manner of means go before breakfast why
what did you reckon i wanted you to go at all for miss_mary_jane well i never thought and come to think i dont know
what was it why it because you aint one of these leather face people i dont want no better book than what your face is
a body can set down and read it off like coarse print do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good morning and never
there there dont yes i ll go before breakfast i ll be glad to and leave my sisters with them yes never mind about them
i dont want you to see them nor your sisters nor nobody in this town if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something
they ve got to stand it yet a while they might suspicion something if all of you was to go no you go right along miss_mary_jane and i ll fix it with all of them
i ll tell miss susan to give your love to your uncles and say you ve went away for a few hour for to get a little rest and change or to see a friend and you ll be back to night or early in the morning
gone to see a friend is all right but i wont have my love given to them well then it sha nt be
it was only a little thing to do and no trouble and it the little thing that smooths people roads the most down here below it would make miss_mary_jane comfortable and it wouldnt cost nothing
it was well enough to tell her so no harm in it then i says there one more thing that bag of money
well they ve got that and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it no you re out there
i had it because i stole it from them and i stole it to give to you and i know where i hid it but i afraid it aint there
they haint got it why who got it i wish i knowed but i dont no more i awful sorry miss_mary_jane
i come nigh getting caught and i had to shove it into the first place i come to and run and it warnt a good place
i just as sorry as i can be but i done the best i could i did honest
oh stop blaming yourself it too bad to do it and i wont allow it you couldnt help it it wasnt your fault
i didnt want to set her to thinking about her trouble again and i couldnt seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach
so for a minute i didnt say nothing then i says i ruther not tell you where i put it miss_mary_jane if you dont mind letting me off but i ll write it for you on a piece of paper and you can read it along the road to mr lothrop if you want to
where did you hide it do you reckon that ll do oh yes so i wrote i put it in the coffin
it was in there when you was crying there away in the night i was behind the door and i was mighty sorry for you miss_mary_jane
it made my eye water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night and them devils laying there right under her own roof shaming her and robbing her and when i folded it up and give it to her
i see the water come into her eye too and she shook me by the hand hard and says good bye
if i dont ever see you again i sha nt ever forget you and i ll think of you a many and a many a time and
i going to do everything just as you ve told me and i ll pray for you too and she was gone pray for me
i reckoned if she knowed me she take a job that was more nearer her size but i bet she done it just the same
she was just that kind she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notion there warnt no back down to her i judge
you may say what you want to but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see in my opinion she was just full of sand
it sounds like flattery but it aint no flattery and when it comes to beauty and goodness too she lays over them all
i haint ever seen her since that time that i see her go out of that door no i haint ever seen her since but i reckon i ve thought of her a many and a many a million time and of her saying she would pray for me and if ever i a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her blamed if i wouldnt a done it or bust
when i struck susan and the hare lip i says what the name of them people over ont other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes
well miss_mary_jane she lit out the back way i reckon because nobody see her go they says there several but it the proctors mainly
that the name i says i most forgot it well miss_mary_jane she told me to tell you she gone over there in a dreadful hurry
one of them sick which one i dont know leastways i kinder forget but i thinks it sakes alive i hope it aint hanner
i sorry to say it i says but hanner the very one my goodness and she so well only last week
is she took bad it aint no name for it they set up with her all night miss_mary_jane said and they dont think she ll last many hour
only think of that now what the matter with her i couldnt think of anything reasonable right off that way so i says
mumps mumps your granny they dont set up with people that got the mumps they dont dont they you better bet they do with these mumps
these mumps is different it a new kind miss_mary_jane said how it a new kind because it mixed up with other thing
what other thing well measles and whooping cough and erysiplas and consumption and yaller janders and brain fever and i dont know what all
my land and they call it the mumps that what miss_mary_jane said well what in the nation do they call it the mumps for
a body might stump his toe and take pison and fall down the well and break his neck and bust his brains out and somebody come along and ask what killed him and some numskull up and say why he stumped his toe
why because it is the mumps that what it starts with well ther aint no sense in it would ther be any sense in that
no and ther aint no sense in this nuther is it ketching is it ketching why how you talk
is a harrow catching in the dark if you dont hitch on to one tooth you re bound to on another aint you
well these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow as you may say and it aint no slouch of a harrow nuther you come to get it hitched on good
and you cant get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along can you well it awful i think says the hare lip
i ll go to uncle_harvey and oh yes i says i would of course i would i wouldnt lose no time
well why wouldnt you just look at it a minute and maybe you can see haint your uncles obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can
and do you reckon they be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves
you know they ll wait for you so fur so good your uncle_harvey a preacher aint he very well then is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk
is he going to deceive a ship clerk so as to get them to let miss_mary_jane go aboard now you know he aint
why he ll say it a great pity but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus unum mumps and so it my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she got it
but never mind if you think it best to tell your uncle_harvey shucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good time in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether miss_mary_jane got it or not
what will he do then why you talk like a muggins well anyway maybe you better tell some of the neighbors
listen at that now you do beat all for natural stupidness cant you see that they go and tell ther aint no way
but just to not tell anybody at all well maybe you re right yes i judge you are right
but i reckon we ought to tell uncle_harvey she gone out a while anyway so he wont be uneasy about her
she says tell them to give uncle_harvey and william_fourth my love and a kiss and say i ve run over the river to see mr mr what is the name of that rich family your uncle peter_wilks used to think so much of i mean the one that
yes miss_mary_jane she wanted you to do that why you must mean the apthorps aint it of course bother them kind of name a body cant ever seem to remember them half the time somehow
yes she said say she has run over for to ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house because she allowed her uncle peter_wilks would ruther
and she going to stick to them till they say they ll come and then if she aint too tired she coming home and if she is she ll be home in the morning anyway
she said dont say nothing about the proctors but only about the apthorps which ll be perfectly true because she is going there to speak about their buying the house i know it because she told me so herself
all right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles and give them the love and the kisses and tell them the message
the girl wouldnt say nothing because they wanted to go to england and the king and the duke would ruther miss_mary_jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor robinson
i felt very good i judged i had done it pretty neat i reckoned jim_tom_sawyer couldnt a done it no neater himself
of course he would a throwed more style into it but i cant do that very handy not being brung up to it
well they held the auction in the public square along towards the end of the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of the auctioneer and chipping in a little scripture now and then or a little goody goody saying of some kind and the duke he was around goo gooing for sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generly
but by and by the thing dragged through and everything was sold everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard
so they got to work that off i never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything
well whilst they was at it a steamboat landed and in about two minute up comes a crowd a whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on and singing out
they had it than anybody else everything was all right now here your opposition line here your two sets heirs to old peter_wilks and you pays your money and you takes your choice
they was fetching a very nice looking old gentleman along and a nice looking younger one with his right arm in a sling
but i didnt see no joke about it and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any
chapter xxix and my souls how the people yelled and laughed and kept it up i reckoned they turn pale but no nary a pale did they turn
the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up but just went a goo gooing around happy and satisfied like a jug that googling out buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new comers like it give him the stomach ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world
oh he done it admirable lot of the principal people gethered around the king to let him see they was on his side
pretty soon he begun to speak and i see straight off he pronounced like an englishman not the king way though the king was pretty good for an imitation
i cant give the old gent word nor i cant imitate him but he turned around to the crowd and says about like this this is a surprise to me which i wasnt looking for and i ll acknowledge candid and frank i aint very well fixed to meet it and answer it
for my brother and me has had misfortunes he broke his arm and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake
i am peter_wilks brother uncle_harvey and this is his brother william_fourth which cant hear nor speak and cant even make signs to amount to much nowt he only got one hand to work them with
we are who we say we are and in a day or two when i get the baggage i can prove it
that old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death but up till then i wont say nothing more but go to the hotel and wait
so him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs and blethers out broke his arm very likely aint it and very convenient too for a fraud that got to make signs and aint learnt how
lost their baggage that mighty good and mighty ingenious under the circumstances so he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or four or maybe half a dozen
one of these was that doctor another one was a sharp looking gentleman with a carpet bag of the old fashioned kind made out of carpet stuff that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their head it was levi bell the lawyer that was gone up to louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to the king now
and when the king got done this husky up and says say looky here if you are uncle_harvey wilks when you come to this town
the day before the funeral friend says the king but what time day in the evenin bout an hour er two before sundown
how you come i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati well then how you come to be up at the pint in the mornin
several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher
in a canoe i warnt up at the pint in the mornin it a lie preacher be hanged he a fraud and a liar
he was up at the pint that mornin i live up there dont i well i was up there and he was up there
i see him there he come in a canoe along with tim collins and a boy the doctor he up and says would you know the boy again if you was to see him hines
i reckon i would but i dont know why yonder he is now i know him perfectly easy it was me he pointed at
the doctor says neighbors i dont know whether the new couple is frauds or not but if these two aint frauds i am an idiot that all
i think it our duty to see that they dont get away from here till we ve looked into this thing come along hines come along the rest of you
we ll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them witht other couple and i reckon we ll find out something before we get through
it was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the king friends so we all started it was about sundown
the doctor he led me along by the hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my hand
we all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candle and fetched in the new couple
first the doctor says i dont wish to be too hard on these two man but i think they re frauds and they may have complices that we dont know nothing about
if these man aint frauds they wont object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they re all right
if they have wont the complices get away with that bag of gold peter_wilks left it aint unlikely aint that so
everybody agreed to that so i judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart
but the king he only looked sorrowful and says gentleman i wish the money was there for i aint got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair open out and out investigation this misable business but alas the money aint there you n send and see if you want to
well when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it inside the straw tick my bed not wishin to bank it for the few day we be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not bein used to nigger and suppos em honest like servants in england
the nigger stole it the very next mornin after i had went down stairs and when i sold em i hadnt missed the money yit so they got clean away with it
where is it then my servant here n tell you bout it gentleman the doctor and several said shucks
and i see nobody didnt altogether believe him one man asked me if i see the nigger steal it i said no but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and i never thought nothing
only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them
that was all they asked me then the doctor whirls on me and says are you english too i says yes and him and some others laughed and said stuff
well then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we had it up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word about supper nor ever seemed to think about it
and so they kept it up and kept it up and it was the worst mixed up thing you ever see
they made the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell his and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth andt other one lies
the king he give me a left handed look out of the corner of his eye and so i knowed enough to talk on the right side
i begun to tell about sheffield and how we lived there and all about the english wilkses and so on but i didnt get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh and levi bell the lawyer says set down my boy i wouldnt strain myself if i was you
and by and by they had me up to tell what i knowed i reckon you aint used to lying it dont seem to come handy what you want is practice
you do it pretty awkward i didnt care nothing for the compliment but i was glad to be let off anyway
the king broke in and reached out his hand and says why is this my poor dead brother old friend that he wrote so often about
the doctor he started to say something and turns and says if you been in town at first levi bell
the lawyer and him shook hand and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased and they talked right along awhile and then got to one side and talked low and at last the lawyer speaks up and says that ll fix it
so they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off something and then they give the pen to the duke and then for the first time the duke looked sick
i ll take the order and send it along with your brother and then they ll know it all right but he took the pen and wrote
so then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your name
the lawyer looked powerful astonished and says well it beats me and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket and examined them and then examined the old man writing and then them again and then says these old letters is from uncle_harvey wilks and here these two handwritings and anybody can see they didnt write them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish
i tell you to see how the lawyer had took them in and here this old gentleman hand writing and anybody can tell easy enough he didnt write them
the old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it fact is the scratches he makes aint properly writing at all
now here some letters from the new old gentleman says if you please let me explain nobody can read my hand
but my brother there so he copies for me it his hand you ve got there not mine well says the lawyer this is a state of thing
i ve got some of william_fourth letters too so if you ll get him to write a line or so we can com
he cant write with his left hand says the old gentleman if he could use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too
the lawyer done it and says i believe it so and if it aint so there a heap stronger resemblance than i noticed before anyway
look at both please they re by the same hand well well well i thought we was right on the track of a solution but it gone to grass partly
but anyway one thing is proved these two aint either of em wilkses and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke
well what do you think that muleheaded old fool wouldnt give in then indeed he wouldnt said it warnt no fair test
said his brother william_fourth was the cussedest joker in the world and hadnt tried to write he see william_fourth was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper
and so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and says i ve thought of something
is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br helped to lay out the late peter_wilks for burying
then the old man turns towards the king and says perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast
blamed if the king didnt have to brace up mighty quick or he a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it took him so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man
he whitened a little he couldnt help it and it was mighty still in there and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him
yes says somebody me and ab turner done it we re both here says i to myself now he ll throw up the sponge there aint no more use
i reckon he thought he keep the thing up till he tired them people out so they thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away
well did he a body cant hardly believe it but he didnt anyway he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and says mf
it a very tough question aint it yes sir i n tell you what tattooed on his breast it jest a small thin blue arrow that what it is and if you dont look clost you cant see it
the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard and his eye light up like he judged he got the king this time and says there you ve heard what he said
now what do you say hey well i never see anything like that old blister for clean out and out cheek was there any such mark on peter_wilks breast
now what you did see on his breast was a small dim and a which is an initial he dropped when he was young and a with dashes between them so b
both of them spoke up and says we didnt see no such mark good says the old gentleman and he marked them that way on a piece of paper
come aint that what you saw both of them spoke up again and says no we didnt we never seen any marks at all
well everybody was in a state of mind now and they sings out the whole bilin of s frauds
le duck em le drown em le ride em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and there was a rattling powwow
but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells and says gentleman gentle man hear me just a word just a single word if you please
there one way yet let go and dig up the corpse and look that took them hooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyer and the doctor sung out hold on hold on
collar all these four man and the boy and fetch them along too we ll do it they all shouted and if we dont find them marks we ll lynch the whole gang
they gripped us all and marched us right along straight for the graveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the whole town at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in the evening
as we went by our house i wished i hadnt sent miss_mary_jane out of town because now if i could tip her the wink she light out and save me and blow on our dead beats
well we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on like wildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves
i was scared now i tell you but there warnt no getting away you know this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome
stead of being fixed so i could take my own time if i wanted to and see all the fun and have miss_mary_jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close fit come here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death
i ever was in and i was kinder stunned everything was going so different from what i had allowed for but just them tattoo marks
if they didnt find them i couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldnt think about nothing else
it got darker and darker and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by the wrist hines and a body might as well try to give goliar the slip
he dragged me right along he was so excited and i had to run to keep up when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow
and when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred time as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadnt thought to fetch a lantern
but they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half a mile off to borrow one
so they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rain started and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning come brisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never took no notice of it
they was so full of this business and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second the dark wiped it all out and you couldnt see nothing at all
at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was to scrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it was awful
hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so and i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world he was so excited and panting
all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare and somebody sings out by the living jingo here the bag of gold on his breast
hines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way i lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there aint nobody can tell
i had the road all to myself and i fairly flew leastways i had it all to myself except the solid dark and the now and then glares and the buzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting of the thunder and sure as you are born i did clip it along
so i never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through the main one and when i begun to get towards our house
when i struck the town i see there warnt nobody out in the storm i aimed my eye and set it
no light there the house all dark which made me feel sorry and disappointed i didnt know why but at last just as i was sailing by flash comes the light in miss_mary_jane window
and my heart swelled up sudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark and wasnt ever going to be before me no more in this world
the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the towhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasnt chained
she was the best girl i ever see and had the most sand i snatched it and shoved it was a canoe and warnt fastened with nothing but a rope
the towhead was a rattling big distance off away out there in the middle of the river but i didnt lose no time and when i struck the raft at last
i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afforded it but i didnt
as i sprung aboard i sung out out with you jim_tom_sawyer and set her loose glory be to goodness we re shut of them
jim_tom_sawyer lit out and was a coming for me with both arm spread he was so full of joy but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backwards for i forgot he was old king lear and a drownded a rab all in one and it most scared the livers and light out of me
but jim_tom_sawyer fished me out and was going to hug me and bless me and so on he was so glad i was back
and we was shut of the king and the duke but i says not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast
so in two seconds away we went a sliding down the river and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and nobody to bother us
cut loose and let her slide i had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack my heels a few time
i couldnt help it but about the third crack i noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well and held my breath and listened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted out over the water here they come and just a laying to their oars and making their skiff hum
so i wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it was all i could do to keep from crying
when they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar and says tryin to give us the slip was ye you pup
it was the king and the duke chapter xxx tired of our company hey i says no your majesty we warnt please dont your majesty
quick then and tell us what was your idea or i ll shake the insides out you honest i ll tell you everything just as it happened your majesty
the man that had a holt of me was very good to me and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets go of me and whispers
it didnt seem no good for me to stay i couldnt do nothing and i didnt want to be hung if i could get away
so i never stopped running till i found the canoe and when i got here i told jim_tom_sawyer to hurry or they catch me and hang me yet and said i was afeard you and the duke wasnt alive now and i was awful sorry and so was jim_tom_sawyer and was awful glad when we see you coming
heel it now or they ll hang ye sure and i lit out you may ask jim_tom_sawyer if i didnt
jim_tom_sawyer said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said oh yes it mighty likely and shook me up again and said he reckoned he drownd me
but the duke says leggo the boy you old idiot would you a done any different did you inquire around for him when you got loose
i dont remember it so the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it
but the duke says you better a blame sight give yourself a good cussing for you re the one that entitled to it most
you haint done a thing from the start that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue arrow mark
that was bright it was right down bully and it was the thing that saved us for if it hadnt been for that they a jailed us till them
but that trick took em to the graveyard and the gold done us a still bigger kindness for if the excited fools hadnt let go all holts and made that rush to get a look
englishmen baggage come and then the penitentiary you bet we a slept in our cravats to night cravats warranted to wear too longer than we need em
they was still a minute thinking then the king says kind of absent minded like mf and we reckoned the nigger stole it
that made me squirm yes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic we did after about a half a minute the king drawls out leastways i did
the duke says the same way on the contrary i did the king kind of ruffles up and says looky here bilgewater what you referrin to
shucks says the king very sarcastic but i dont know maybe you was asleep and didnt know what you was about
the duke says pretty brisk when it comes to that maybe you ll let me ask what was you referring to
the duke bristles up now and says oh let up on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame fool
dont you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin yes sir i know you do know because you done it yourself
it a lie and the duke went for him the king sings out take r hand off leggo my throat i take it all back
the duke says well you just own up first that you did hide that money there intending to give me the slip one of these day and come back and dig it up and have it all to yourself
wait jest a minute duke answer me this one question honest and fair if you didnt put the money there say it and i ll lieve you and take back everything i said
but answer me only jest this one more now dont git mad didnt you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it
the duke never said nothing for a little bit then he says well i dont care if i did i didnt do it anyway
you old scoundrel i didnt and you know i didnt there now well then i lieve you but you not only had it in mind to do it but you done it
i wisht i never die if i done it duke and that honest i wont say i warnt goin to do it because i was but you i mean somebody got in ahead
you done it and you got to say you done it or the king began to gurgle and then he gasps out
i was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easier than what i was feeling before
o me it a lie nough i own up so the duke took his hand off and says if you ever deny it again i ll drown you
it well for you to set there and blubber like a baby it fitten for you after the way you ve acted
i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything and i a trusting you all the time like you was my own father
you ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor nigger and you never say a word for em
cuss you i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit you wanted to get what money i got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another and scoop it all
the king says timid and still a snuffling why duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt me
it makes me feel ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believe that rubbage dry up i dont want to hear no more out of you says the duke
and now you see what you got by it they ve got all their own money back and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides
so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort and before long the duke tackled his bottle and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got the lovinger they got and went off a snoring in each other arm
they both got powerful mellow but i noticed the king didnt get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money bag again
g long to bed and dont you deffersit me no more deffersits long you live that made me feel easy and satisfied
of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble and i told jim_tom_sawyer everything chapter xxxi we dasnt stop again at any town for day and day kept right along down the river
we was down south in the warm weather now and a mighty long way from home we begun to come to tree with spanish moss on them hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards
it was the first i ever see it growing and it made the wood look solemn and dismal so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and they begun to work the villages again
then in another village they started a dancing school but they didnt know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town
another time they tried to go at yellocution but they didnt yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing and made them skip out
they tackled missionarying and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes and a little of everything but they couldnt seem to have no luck
so at last they got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she floated along thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by the half a day at a time and dreadful blue and desperate
and at last they took a change and begun to lay their head together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hour at a time
first they done a lecture on temperance but they didnt make enough for them both to get drunk on jim_tom_sawyer and me got uneasy
we turned it over and over and at last we made up our mind they was going to break into somebody house or store or was going into the counterfeit money business or something
so then we was pretty scared and made up an agreement that we wouldnt have nothing in the world to do with such actions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind
well early one morning we hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named pikesville and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet
we didnt like the look of it we judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever house to rob you mean says i to myself and
when you get through robbing it you ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim_tom_sawyer and the raft and you ll have to take it out in wondering
and he said if he warnt back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come along
so we stayed where we was the duke he fretted and sweated around and was in a mighty sour way he scolded us for everything and we couldnt seem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thing
i was good and glad when midday come and no king we could have a change anyway and maybe a chance for the change on top of it
so me and the duke went up to the village and hunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport and he a cussing and a threatening with all his might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do nothing to them
the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the king begun to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it
i lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind leg and spun down the river road like a deer for i see our chance and i made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and jim_tom_sawyer again
something was a brewing sure i got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy and sung out set her loose jim_tom_sawyer
i set up a shout and then another and then another one and run this way and that in the wood whooping and screeching but it warnt no use old jim_tom_sawyer was gone
we re all right now but there warnt no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam jim_tom_sawyer was gone then i set down and cried i couldnt help it
pretty soon i went out on the road trying to think what i better do and i run across a boy walking and asked him if he seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he says yes
but i couldnt set still long whereabouts says i down to uncle_silas phelps place two mile below here he a runaway nigger and they ve got him
i run across him in the wood about an hour or two ago and he said if i hollered he cut my livers out and told me to lay down and stay where i was and i done it
was you looking for him you bet i aint been there ever since afeard to come out well he says you neednt be afeard no more becuz they ve got him
he run off m down south som ers it a good job they got him well i reckon there two hunderd dollar reward on him
it like picking up money out the road yes it is and i could a had it if i been big enough i see him first
it was an old fellow a stranger and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollar becuz he got to go up the river and cant wait
who nailed him think that now you bet i wait if it was seven year that me every time says i
but maybe his chance aint worth no more than that if he ll sell it so cheap maybe there something aint straight about it
it tells all about him to a dot paints him like a picture and tells the plantation he frum below newr leans
but it is though straight as a string i see the handbill myself no sirree bob they aint no trouble bout that speculation you bet you
say gimme a chaw tobacker wont ye i didnt have none so he left i went to the raft and set down in the wigwam to think
but i couldnt come to nothing i thought till i wore my head sore but i couldnt see no way out of the trouble
after all this long journey and after all we done for them scoundrels here it was all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined because they could have the heart to serve jim_tom_sawyer such a trick as that and make him a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for forty dirty dollar
once i said to myself it would be a thousand time better for jim_tom_sawyer to be a slave at home where his family was as long as he got to be a slave and so i better write a letter to jim_tom_sawyer and tell him to tell miss_watson where he was
but i soon give up that notion for two thing she be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her and so she sell him straight down the river again and if she didnt everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger and they make jim_tom_sawyer feel it all the time
it would get all around that huck_creeps huck_finn helped a nigger to get his freedom and if i was ever to see anybody from that town again i be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame
that just the way a person does a low down thing and then he dont want to take no consequences of it
and so he feel ornery and disgraced and then think of me thinks as long as he can hide it
the more i studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me and the more wicked and low down and ornery
and at last when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven whilst i was stealing a poor old woman nigger that hadnt ever done me no harm and now was showing me
there one that always on the lookout and aint a going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and
it aint no disgrace that was my fix exactly i got to feeling no further i most dropped in my tracks
well i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked and
so much to blame but something inside of me kept saying there was the sunday school you could a gone to it and if you a done it
i was so scared so i warnt they a learnt you there that people that acts as i been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire
and i about made up my mind to pray and see if i couldnt try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better
it made me shiver so i kneeled down but the word wouldnt come why wouldnt they it warnt no use to try and hide it from him
nor from me neither i knowed very well why they wouldnt come it was because my heart warnt right it was because i warn t
i was letting on to give up sin but away inside of me i was holding on to the biggest one of all
i was trying to make my mouth say i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that nigger owner and tell where he was but deep down in me i knowed it was a lie and he knowed it
square it was because i was playing double you cant pray a lie i found that out so i was full of trouble full as i could be and didnt know what to do
at last i had an idea and i says i ll go and write the letter and then see if i can pray
why it was astonishing the way i felt as light as a feather right straight off and my trouble all gone
so i got a piece of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set down and wrote miss_watson your runaway nigger jim_tom_sawyer is down here two mile below pikesville and mr phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send
i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life and i knowed i could pray now
but i didnt do it straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinking thinking how good it was all this happened so and how near i come to being lost and going to hell
and got to thinking over our trip down the river and i see jim_tom_sawyer before me all the time in the day and in the night time sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and we a floating along talking and singing and laughing
huck_creeps huck_finn and went on thinking but somehow i couldnt seem to strike no place to harden me against him but only the other kind
i see him standing my watch on top of his stead of calling me so i could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up there where the feud was and such like time and would always call me honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and how good he always was and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling the man we had small pox aboard and he was so grateful and said i was the best friend old
jim_tom_sawyer ever had in the world and the only one he got now and then i happened to look around and see that paper
it was a close place i took it up and held it in my hand i was a trembling because i got to decide forever betwixt two thing and i knowed it
i studied a minute sort of holding my breath and then says to myself all right then i ll go to hell and tore it up
it was awful thoughts and awful word but they was said and i let them stay said and never thought no more about reforming
i shoved the whole thing out of my head and said i would take up wickedness again which was in my line being brung up to it and the other warnt
and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim_tom_sawyer out of slavery again and if i could think up anything worse i would do that too because as long as i was in and in for good i might as well go the whole hog
then i set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over some considerable many way in my mind and at last fixed up a plan that suited me
so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my raft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in
i slept the night through and got up before it was light and had my breakfast and put on my store clothe and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore
i landed below where i judged was phelps place and hid my bundle in the wood and then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank
then i struck up the road and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it phelps sawmill and when i come to the farm house two or three hundred yards further along i kept my eye peeled but didnt see nobody around though it was good daylight now
but i didnt mind because i didnt want to see nobody just yet i only wanted to get the lay of the land
according to my plan i was going to turn up there from the village not from below so i just took a look and shoved along straight for town
well the very first man i see when i got there was the duke he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuch three night performance like that other time
they had the cheek them frauds i was right on him before i could shirk he looked astonished and says hel lo
where you come from then he says kind of glad and eager where the raft got her in a good place
i says why that just what i was going to ask your grace then he didnt look so joyful and says what was your idea for asking me
we cant get him home for hour till he soberer so i went a loafing around town to put in the time and wait
a man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep and so i went along but when we was dragging him to the boat and the man left me a holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we after him
we didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out
he says well i says when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to myself we never got him till dark then we fetched him over and i started down for the raft
when i got there and see it was gone i says to myself they ve got into trouble and had to leave and they ve took my nigger which is the only nigger i ve got in the world and now i in a strange country and aint got no property no more nor nothing and no way to make my living so i set down and cried
i slept in the wood all night but what did become of the raft then and jim_tom_sawyer poor jim_tom_sawyer blamed if i know that is what become of the raft
that old fool had made a trade and got forty dollar and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half dollar with him and got every cent
when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone we said that little rascal has stole our raft and shook us and run off down the river
but what he spent for whisky and i wouldnt shake my nigger would i the only nigger i had in the world and the only property
we never thought of that fact is i reckon we come to consider him our nigger yes we did consider him so
so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke there warnt anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake
goodness knows we had trouble enough for him and i ve pegged along ever since dry as a powder horn where that ten cents
i had considerable money so i give him ten cents but begged him to spend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all the money i had and i hadnt had nothing to eat since yesterday
give it here he never said nothing the next minute he whirls on me and says do you reckon that nigger would blow on us
we skin him if he done that how can he blow haint he run off no that old fool sold him and never divided with me and the money gone
sold him i says and begun to cry why he was my nigger and that was my money where is he i want my nigger
well you cant get your nigger that all so dry up your blubbering looky here do you think you venture to blow on us
why if you was to blow on us he stopped but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eye before
i went on a whimpering and says i dont want to blow on nobody and i aint got no time to blow nohow
blamed if i think i trust you i got to turn out and find my nigger he looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead
at last he says i ll tell you something we got to be here three day if you ll promise you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow i ll tell you where to find him
you see he started to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun to study and think again i reckoned he was changing his mind
so i promised and he says a farmer by the name of uncle_silas ph and then he stopped and so he was
so pretty soon he says the man that bought him is named abram foster abram foster and he lives forty mile back here in the country on the road to lafayette
he wouldnt trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three day
no you wont you ll start now and dont you lose any time about it neither nor do any gabbling by the way
just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along and then you wont get into trouble with us ye hear
all right i says i can walk it in three day and i ll start this very afternoon that was the order i wanted and that was the one i played for
i wanted to be left free to work my plans so clear out he says and you can tell mr foster whatever you want to
maybe you can get him to believe that jim_tom_sawyer is your nigger some idiots dont require documents leastways i ve heard there such down south here
and when you tell him the handbill and the reward bogus maybe he ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting em out
go long now and tell him anything you want to but mind you dont work your jaw any between here and there
so i left and struck for the back country i didnt look around but i kinder felt like he was watching me
i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i stopped then i doubled back through the wood towards phelps
i reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around because i wanted to stop jim_tom_sawyer mouth till these fellows could get away
but i knowed i could tire him out at that i didnt want no trouble with their kind i seen all i wanted to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of them
when i got there it was all still and sunday like and hot and sunshiny the hand was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like it spirits whispering spirits that been dead ever so many year and you always think they re talking about you
chapter xxxii as a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead too and done with it all phelps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
a stile made out of log sawed off and up ended in steps like barrels of a different length to climb over the fence with and for the woman to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse some sickly grass patches in the big yard but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with the nap rubbed off big double log house for the white folks hewed log with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mud stripes been whitewashed some time or another round log kitchen with a big broad open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smoke house back of the kitchen three little log nigger cabin in a rowt other side the smoke house one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ash hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench by the kitchen door with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep there in the sun more hounds asleep round about about three shade tree away off in a corner some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch then the cotton fields begins and after the fields the wood
a rail fence round a two acre yard i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
when i got a little way i heard the dim hum of a spinning wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again and then i knowed for certain
i went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting to providence to put the right word in my mouth when the time come for i noticed that providence always did put the right word in my mouth if i left it alone
when i got half way first one hound and then another got up and went for me and of course i stopped and faced them and kept still
i wished i was dead for that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world and such another powwow as they made
in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a hub of a wheel as you may say spokes made out of dog circle of fifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and noses stretched up towards me a barking and howling and more a coming you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres
a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling pin in her hand singing out begone you tige you spot
and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling and then the rest followed and the next second half of them come back wagging their tails around me and making friends with me
and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boy without anything on but tow linen shirts and they hung on to their mother gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way they always do
and here comes the white woman running from the house about forty five or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinning stick in her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting the same way the little nigger was doing
begone sah there aint no harm in a hound nohow she was smiling all over so she could hardly stand and says it you at
she grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hand and shook and shook and the tears come in her eye and run down over and she couldnt seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying you dont look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would but law sakes i dont care for that i so glad to see you
last aint it i out with a yes before i thought dear dear it does seem like i could eat you up
children it your cousin jim_tom_sawyer tell him howdy but they ducked their head and put their fingers in their mouths and hid behind her
so she run on lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away or did you get your breakfast on the boat
i said i had got it on the boat so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
when we got there she set me down in a split bottomed chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hand and says now i can have a good look at you and laws a me i ve been hungry for it a many and a many a time all these long year and it come at last
we been expecting you a couple of day and more what kep you boat get aground yes she dont say yes say aunt_sally
i didnt rightly know what to say because i didnt know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down
where she get aground but i go a good deal on instinct and my instinct said she would be coming up from down towards orleans
that didnt help me much though for i didnt know the name of bars down that way i see i got to invent a bar or forget the name of the one we got aground on
or now i struck an idea and fetched it out it warnt the grounding that didnt keep us back but a little we blowed out a cylinder head
two year ago last christmas your uncle_silas was coming up from newrleans on the old lally rook and she blowed out a cylinder head and crippled a man
good gracious anybody hurt no killed a nigger well it lucky because sometimes people do get hurt and i think he died afterwards
he was a baptist your uncle_silas knowed a family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well yes i remember now he did die
mortification set in and they had to amputate him but it didnt save him yes it was mortification that was it he turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection
they say he was a sight to look at your uncle been up to the town every day to fetch you
and he gone again not more an hour ago he ll be back any minute now you must a met him on the road didnt you oldish man with a
the boat landed just at daylight and i left my baggage on the wharf boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country to put in the time and not get here too soon and so i come down the back way
no i didnt see nobody aunt_sally who you give the baggage to nobody why child it ll be stole
not where i hid it i reckon it wont i says how you get your breakfast so early on the boat
it was kinder thin ice but i says the captain see me standing around and told me i better have something to eat before i went ashore so he took me in the texas to the officers lunch and give me all i wanted
i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
i was getting so uneasy i couldnt listen good but i couldnt get no show mrs phelps kept it up and run on so
pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back because she says but here we re a running on this way and you haint told me a word about sis nor any of them
tell me all about all every one of and how they are and what they re doing and what they told you to tell me and
now i ll rest my work a little and you start up yourn just tell me everything every last thing you can think of
well i see i was up a stump and up it good providence had stood by me this fur all right but i was hard and tight aground now
i see it warnt a bit of use to try to go ahead i got to throw up my hand so i says to myself here another place where i got to resk the truth
i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
stick your head down lower there that ll do you cant be seen now dont you let on you re here i ll play a joke on him
children dont you say a word i see i was in a fix now but it warnt no use to worry there warnt nothing to do
but just hold still and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in then the bed hid him
mrs phelps she jumps for him and says has he come no says her husband good ness gracious
she says what in the warld can have become of him i cant imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
uneasy she says i ready to go distracted he must a come and you ve missed him along the road
i know it so something tells me so why aunt_sally i couldnt miss him along the road you know that but oh dear dear what will sis say
he must a come you must a missed him he oh dont distress me any more i already distressed i dont know what in the world to make of it
i at my wit end and i dont mind acknowledgingt i right down scared but there no hope that he come for he couldnt come and me miss him
aunt_sally it terrible just terrible something happened to the boat sure why uncle_silas look yonder up the road aint that somebody coming he sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give mrs phelps the chance she wanted
she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull and out i come and when he turned back from the window there she stood a beaming and a smiling like a house afire and i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside
the old gentleman stared and says why who that who do you reckont is i haint no idea who is it
but there warnt no time to swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry and then how they both did fire off questions about mars_sid and miss_mary_jane and the rest of the tribe
it jim_tom_sawyer by jings i most slumped through the floor but if they was joyful it warnt nothing to what i was for it was like being born again
well they froze to me for two hour and at last when my chin was so tired it couldnt hardly go any more i had told them more about my family
i was so glad to find out who i was i mean the jim_tom_sawyer family than ever happened to any six jim_tom_sawyer family
and i explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder head at the mouth of white river and it took us three day to fix it
which was all right and worked first rate because they didnt know but what it would take three day to fix it
if i a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty uncomfortable all up the other
being jim_tom_sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
and pose he steps in here any minute and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep quiet
then i says to myself pose jim_tom_sawyer comes down on that boat well i couldnt have it that way it wouldnt do at all
i must go up the road and waylay him so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage
the old gentleman was for going along with me but i said no i could drive the horse myself and i druther he wouldnt take no trouble about me
so i started for town in the wagon and when i was half way i see a wagon coming and sure enough it was jim_tom_sawyer and i stopped and waited till he come along
i says hold on and it stopped alongside and his mouth opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowed two or three time like a person that got a dry throat and then says i haint ever done you no harm
chapter xxxiii you know that so then what you want to come back and ha nt me for i says i haint come back i haint been gone
when he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warnt quite satisfied yet he says dont you play nothing on me because i wouldnt on you
honest injun now you aint a ghost honest injun i aint i says well i i well that ought to settle it of course but i cant somehow seem to understand it no way
looky here warnt you ever murdered at all no i warnt ever murdered at all i played it on them
so he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see me again he didnt know what to do
and he wanted to know all about it right off because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so it hit him where he lived
but i said leave it alone till by and by and told his driver to wait and we drove off a little piece and i told him the kind of a fix i was in and what did he reckon we better do
you come in here and feel of me if you dont believe me he said let him alone a minute and dont disturb him
take my trunk in your wagon and let on it your and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to the house about the time you ought to and i ll go towards town a piece and take a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you and you neednt let on to know me at first
so he thought and thought and pretty soon he says it all right i ve got it i says all right but wait a minute
there one more thing a thing that nobody dont know but me and that is there a nigger here that i a trying to steal out of slavery and his name is
jim_tom_sawyer old miss_watson jim_tom_sawyer he says what why jim_tom_sawyer is he stopped and went to studying i says i know what you ll say
you ll say it dirty low down business but what if it is i low down and i a going to steal him and i want you keep mum and not let on
will you his eye lit up and he says i ll help you steal him well i let go all holts then like i was shot
it was the most astonishing speech i ever heard and i bound to say jim_tom_sawyer fell considerable in my estimation only i couldnt believe it
well then i says joking or no joking if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger dont forget to remember that you dont know nothing about him and i dont know nothing about him
jim_tom_sawyer a nigger stealer oh shucks i says you re joking i aint joking either then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off his way
but of course i forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking so i got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip
and i drove mine the old gentleman was at the door and he says why this is wonderful whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it
i wish we a timed her and she haint sweated a hair not a hair it wonderful why i wouldnt take a hundred dollar for that horse now i wouldnt honest and yet i a
sold her for fifteen before and thought twas all she was worth that all he said he was the innocentest best old soul i ever see
only just a farmer he was a preacher too and had a little one horse log church down back of the plantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a church and schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it was worth it too
but it warnt surprising because he warnt there was plenty other farmer preachers like that and done the same way down south
in about half an hour jim_tom_sawyer wagon drove up to the front stile and aunt_sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty yards and says why there somebody come
i wonder who tis why i do believe it a stranger jimmy that one of the children run and tell lize to put on another plate for dinner
everybody made a rush for the front door because of course a stranger dont come every year and so he lays over the yaller fever for interest when he does come
jim_tom_sawyer was over the stile and starting for the house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and we was all bunched in the front door
jim_tom_sawyer had his store clothe on and an audience and that was always nuts for jim_tom_sawyer in them circumstances it warnt no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable
he warnt a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep no he come ca and important like the ram
when he got a front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it
no my boy says the old gentleman i sorry to sayt your driver has deceived you nichols place is down a matter of three mile more
and he didnt want to disturb them and says mr archibald nichols i presume come in come in jim_tom_sawyer he took a look back over his shoulder and says too late he out of sight
yes he gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with us and then we ll hitch up and take you down to nichols
oh i cant make you so much trouble i couldnt think of it i ll walk i dont mind the distance
but we wont let you walk it wouldnt be southern hospitality to do it come right in oh do says aunt_sally it aint a bit of trouble to us not a bit in the world
and besides i ve already told em to put on another plate when i see you coming so you mustnt disappoint us
you must stay it a long dusty three mile and we cant let you walk come right in and make yourself at home
so jim_tom_sawyer he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself be persuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a stranger from hicksville ohio and his name was william_fourth thompson and he made another bow
well he run on and on and on making up stuff about hicksville and everybody in it he could invent and i getting a little nervious and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at last still talking along he reached over and kissed aunt_sally right on the mouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and was going on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand and says you owdacious puppy
he looked kind of hurt and says i surprised at you am you re rp why what do you reckon i am
i ve a good notion to take and say what do you mean by kissing me he looked kind of humble and says i didnt mean nothing am
she took up the spinning stick and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it
i didnt mean no harm i i thought you like it why you born fool what made you think i like it
well i dont know only they they told me you would they told you i would whoever told you another lunatic
it was all she could do to hold in and her eye snapped and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him and she says who everybody
i never heard the beat of it who they why everybody they all said so am out with their name or ther ll be an idiot short
he got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and says i sorry and i warnt expecting it they told me to
they all told me to they all said kiss her and said she like it they all said it every one of them
but i sorry am and i wont do it no more i wont honest you wont wont you well i sh reckon you wont
no i honest about it i wont ever do it again till you ask me till i ask you well i never see the beat of it in my born day
i lay you ll be the methusalem numskull of creation before ever i ask you or the likes of you well he says it does surprise me so
he stopped and looked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres and fetched up on the old gentleman and says didnt you think she like me to kiss her sir
i cant make it out somehow they said you would and i thought you would but why no i i well no i lieve i didnt
then he looks on around the same way to me and says jim_tom_sawyer didnt you think aunt_sally open out her arm and say mars_sid jim_tom_sawyer my land
she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudent young rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but he fended her off and says no not till you ve asked me first
so she didnt lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissed him over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and he took what was left
and after they got a little quiet again she says why dear me i never see such a surprise
we warnt looking for you at all but only jim_tom_sawyer sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him
but i begged and begged and at the last minute she let me come too so coming down the river me and jim_tom_sawyer thought it would be a first rate surprise for him to come here to the house first and for me to by and by tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger
it because it warnt intended for any of us to come but jim_tom_sawyer he says but it was a mistake aunt_sally
this aint no healthy place for a stranger to come no not impudent whelps mars_sid you ought to had your jaws boxed i haint been so put out since i dont know when
but i dont care i dont mind the terms i be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here
well to think of that performance i dont deny it i was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack
we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen and there was thing enough on that table for seven family and all hot too none of your flabby tough meat that laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning
uncle_silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it but it was worth it and it didnt cool it a bit neither the way i ve seen them kind of interruptions do lot of time
there was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and me and jim_tom_sawyer was on the lookout all the time but it warnt no use they didnt happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraid to try to work up to it
but at supper at night one of the little boy says pa maynt jim_tom_sawyer and mars_sid and me go to the show
no says the old man i reckon there aint going to be any and you couldnt go if there was because the runaway nigger told burton and me all about that scandalous show and burton said he would tell the people so i reckon they ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time
jim_tom_sawyer and me was to sleep in the same room and bed so being tired we bid good night and went up to bed right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the lightning rod and shoved for the town for i didnt believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint and so if i didnt hurry up and give them one they get into trouble sure
on the road jim_tom_sawyer he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered and how pap disappeared pretty soon and didnt come back no more and what a stir there was when jim_tom_sawyer run away and i told jim_tom_sawyer all about our royal nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as i had time to and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it it was as much as half after eight then here comes a raging rush of people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tin pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go by and as they went by
so there it was but i couldnt help it i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail
though they was all over tar and feathers and didnt look like nothing in the world that was human just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier plumes
that is i knowed it was the king and the duke well it made me sick to see it and i was sorry for them
poor pitiful rascals it seemed like i couldnt ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world it was a dreadful thing to see
we asked some stragglers about it and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal and the house rose up and went for them
so we poked along back home and i warnt feeling so brash as i was before but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehow though i hadnt done nothing
but that always the way it dont make no difference whether you do right or wrong a person conscience aint got no sense and just goes for him anyway
human beings can be awful cruel to one another we see we was too late couldnt do no good if i had a yaller dog that didnt know no more than a person conscience does i would pison him
it takes up more room than all the rest of a person insides and yet aint no good nohow jim_tom_sawyer he says the same
chapter xxxiv we stopped talking and got to thinking by and by jim_tom_sawyer says looky here huck_creeps what fools we are to not think of it before
i bet i know where jim_tom_sawyer is no where in that hut down by the ash hopper why looky here when we was at dinner didnt you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles
yes what did you think the vittles was for for a dog so i well it wasnt for a dog
why because part of it was watermelon so it was i noticed it well it does beat all that i never thought about a dog not eating watermelon
it shows how a body can see and dont see at the same time well the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked it again when he came out
watermelon shows man lock shows prisoner and it aint likely there two prisoners on such a little plantation and where the people all so kind and good
he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table same key i bet jim_tom_sawyer the prisoner all right i glad we found it out detective fashion i wouldnt give shucks for any other way
now you work your mind and study out a plan to steal jim_tom_sawyer and i will study out one too and we ll take the one we like the best
if i had jim_tom_sawyer head i wouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in a circus nor nothing i can think of
i went to thinking out a plan but only just to be doing something i knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from
what a head for just a boy to have pretty soon jim_tom_sawyer says ready yes i says all right bring it out
my plan is this i says we can easy find out if it jim_tom_sawyer in there then get up my canoe to morrow night and fetch my raft over from the island
then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the river on the raft with jim_tom_sawyer hiding daytimes and running night the way me and jim_tom_sawyer used to do before
wouldnt that plan work work why cert nly it would work like rat a fighting but it too blame simple there aint nothing to it
what the good of a plan that aint no more trouble than that it as mild as goose milk why huck_creeps it wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory
i never said nothing because i warnt expecting nothing different but i knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldnt have none of them objections to it
he told me what it was and i see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim_tom_sawyer just as free a man as mine would and maybe get us all killed besides
and it didnt so i was satisfied and said we would waltz in on it i neednt tell what it was here because i knowed it wouldnt stay the way it was
i knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance
well one thing was dead sure and that was that jim_tom_sawyer was in earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery
here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks at home that had characters and he was bright and not leather headed and knowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he was without any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop to this business and make himself a shame and his family a shame before everybody
and that is what he done that was the thing that was too many for me i couldnt understand it no way at all
it was outrageous and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true friend and let him quit the thing
and i did start to tell him but he shut me up and says dont you reckon i know what i about
right where he was and save himself dont i generly know what i about yes didnt i say i was going to help steal the nigger
yes well then that all he said and that all i said it warnt no use to say any more because when he said he do a thing he always done it
but i couldnt make out how he was willing to go into this thing so i just let it go and never bothered no more about it
when we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down to the hut by the ash hopper for to examine it
if he was bound to have it so i couldnt help it we went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do
they knowed us and didnt make no more noise than country dog is always doing when anything comes by in the night
when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two side and on the side i warnt acquainted with which was the north side we found a square window hole up tolerable high with just one stout board nailed across it
i says here the ticket this hole big enough for jim_tom_sawyer to get through if we wrench off the board
jim_tom_sawyer says it as simple as tit tat toe three in a row and as easy as playing hooky i should hope we can find a way that a little more complicated than that huck_creeps huck_finn
well then i says how ll it do to saw him out the way i done before i was murdered that time
that more like he says it real mysterious and troublesome and good he says but i bet we can find a way that twice as long
betwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a lean to that joined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank
there aint no hurry le keep on looking around it was as long as the hut but narrow only about six foot wide
jim_tom_sawyer he went to the soap kettle and searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with so he took it and prized out one of the staples
the chain fell down and we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadnt no connection with it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor nothing in it but some old rusty played out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow
the match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again and the door was locked as good as ever
the door to it was at the south end and was padlocked jim_tom_sawyer was joyful he says now we re all right
then we started for the house and i went in the back door you only have to pull a buckskin latch string they dont fasten the door but that
we ll dig him out it ll take about a week warnt romantical enough for jim_tom_sawyer no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning rod
but after he got up half way about three time and missed fire and fell every time and the last time most busted his brains out he thought he got to give it up but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and this time he made the trip
in the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabin to pet the dog and make friends with the nigger that fed jim_tom_sawyer if it was jim_tom_sawyer that was being fed
the nigger was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields and jim_tom_sawyer nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and thing and whilst the others was leaving the key come from the house
this nigger had a good natured chuckle headed face and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread that was to keep witches off
he said the witches was pestering him awful these night and making him see all kind of strange thing and hear all kind of strange word and noises and he didnt believe he was ever witched so long before in his life
he got so worked up and got to running on so about his trouble he forgot all about what he been a going to do
the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when you heave a brickbat in a mud puddle and he says yes mars_sid a dog
so jim_tom_sawyer says what the vittles for going to feed the dog cur us dog too does you want to go en look at im
yes i hunched jim_tom_sawyer and whispers you going right here in the daybreak that warnt the plan no it warnt
when we got in we couldnt hardly see anything it was so dark but jim_tom_sawyer was there sure enough and could see us and he sings out why huck_creeps
but it the plan now so drat him we went along but i didnt like it much en good lan
i didnt know nothing to do and if i had i couldnt a done it because that nigger busted in and says why de gracious sakes
ain dat misto jim_tom_sawyer i just knowed how it would be i just expected it do he know you genlmen
we could see pretty well now jim_tom_sawyer he looked at the nigger steady and kind of wondering and says does who know us
why dis yer runaway nigger i dont reckon he does but what put that into your head what put it dar
didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowed you jim_tom_sawyer says in a puzzled up kind of way well that mighty curious
who sung out when did he sing out what did he sing out and turns to me perfectly ca and says did you hear anybody sing out
of course there warnt nothing to be said but the one thing so i says no i aint heard nobody say nothing
then he turns to jim_tom_sawyer and looks him over like he never see him before and says did you sing out
no sah says jim_tom_sawyer i haint said nothing sah not a word no sah i haint said a word
so jim_tom_sawyer turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed and says kind of severe what do you reckon the matter with you anyway
did you ever see us before no sah not as i knows on what made you think somebody sung out
oh it de dad blame witches sah en i wisht i was dead i do dey awluz at it sah en
please to dont tell nobody bout it sah er ole mars uncle_silas he ll scole me kase he say dey aint no witches
dey do mos kill me dey sk yers me so i jis wish to goodness he was heah now den what would he say
i jis bet he couldn fine no way to git aroun it dis time but it awluz jis so people dat sot stays sot
dey wont look into noth en fine it out r deyselves en when you fine it out en tell um bout it dey doan lieve you
jim_tom_sawyer give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobody and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at jim_tom_sawyer and says i wonder if uncle_silas is going to hang this nigger
if i was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away i wouldnt give him up i hang him
and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to jim_tom_sawyer and says dont ever let on to know us
jim_tom_sawyer only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the nigger come back and we said we come again some time if the nigger wanted us to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because the witches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folks around then
and if you hear any digging going on night it us we re going to set you free chapter xxxv
it would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down into the wood because jim_tom_sawyer said we got to have some light to see how to dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into trouble what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that called fox fire and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place
we fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set down to rest and jim_tom_sawyer says kind of dissatisfied blame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be
and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan there aint no watchman to be drugged now there ought to be a watchman
and there jim_tom_sawyer chained by one leg with a ten foot chain to the leg of his bed why all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain
and uncle_silas he trusts everybody sends the key to the punkin headed nigger and dont send nobody to watch the nigger
there aint even a dog to give a sleeping mixture to jim_tom_sawyer could a got out of that window hole before this only there wouldnt be no use trying to travel with a ten foot chain on his leg
why drat it huck_creeps it the stupidest arrangement i ever see you got to invent all the difficulties well we cant help it we got to do the best we can with the materials we ve got
anyhow there one thing there more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers where there warnt one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them and you had to contrive them all out of your own head
now look at just that one thing of the lantern when you come down to the cold facts we simply got to let on that a lantern resky
now whilst i think of it we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get
why we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to i believe what do we want of a saw
what do we want of it haint we got to saw the leg of jim_tom_sawyer bed off so as to get the chain loose
why you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off well if that aint just like you huck_creeps huck_finn
why haint you ever read any book at all baron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleeny nor henri iv nor none of them heroes
you can get up the infant schooliest way of going at a thing who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old maidy way as that
no the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed leg in two and leave it just so and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal cant see no sign of it being sawed and thinks the bed leg is perfectly sound
then the night you re ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slip off your chain and there you are
nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in the moat because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you know and there your horse and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle and away you go to your native langudoc or navarre or wherever it is
it gaudy huck_creeps i wish there was a moat to this cabin if we get time the night of the escape we ll dig one
i says what do we want of a moat when we re going to snake him out from under the cabin
but he never heard me he had forgot me and everything else he had his chin in his hand thinking
pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head then sighs again and says no it wouldnt do there aint necessity enough for it
for what i says why to saw jim_tom_sawyer leg off he says good land i says why there aint no necessity for it
and what would you want to saw his leg off for anyway well some of the best authorities has done it
they couldnt get the chain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved and a leg would be better still
there aint necessity enough in this case and besides jim_tom_sawyer a nigger and wouldnt understand the reasons for it and how it the custom in europe so we ll let it go
but there one thing he can have a rope ladder we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough
but we got to let that go and we can send it to him in a pie it mostly done that way
and i ve et worse pies why jim_tom_sawyer how you talk i says jim_tom_sawyer aint got no use for a rope ladder
he has got use for it how you talk you better say you dont know nothing about it he got to have a rope ladder they all do
what in the nation can he do with it do with it he can hide it in his bed cant he
huck_creeps you dont ever seem to want to do anything that regular you want to be starting something fresh all the time
that what they all do and he got to too pose he dont do nothing with it aint it there in his bed for a clew after he gone
and dont you reckon they ll want clews of course they will and you wouldnt leave them any that would be a pretty howdy do wouldnt it
i never heard of such a thing well i says if it in the regulations and he got to have it
all right let him have it because i dont wish to go back on no regulations but there one thing jim_tom_sawyer
if we go to tearing up our sheets to make jim_tom_sawyer a rope ladder we re going to get into trouble with aunt_sally just as sure as you re born
now the way i look at it a hickry bark ladder dont cost nothing and dont waste nothing and is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as any rag ladder you can start and as for jim_tom_sawyer he aint had no experience and so he dont care what kind of a
oh shucks huck_creeps huck_finn if i was as ignorant as you i keep still that what i do who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry bark ladder
well all right jim_tom_sawyer fix it your own way but if you ll take my advice you ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline
why it perfectly ridiculous he said that would do and that gave him another idea and he says borrow a shirt too
what do we want of a shirt jim_tom_sawyer want it for jim_tom_sawyer to keep a journal on journal your granny jim_tom_sawyer cant write
pose he cant write he can make marks on the shirt cant he if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel hoop
why jim_tom_sawyer we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one and quicker too
prisoners dont have geese running around the donjon keep to pull pens out of you muggins they always make their pens out of the hardest toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like
that they can get their hand on and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out too because they ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall
they wouldnt use a goose quill if they had it it aint regular well then what ll we make him the ink out of
many makes it out of iron rust and tears but that the common sort and woman the best authorities uses their own blood
jim_tom_sawyer can do that and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he captivated he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window
the iron mask always done that and it a blame good way too jim_tom_sawyer aint got no tin plates they feed him in a pan
that aint nothing we can get him some cant nobody read his plates that aint got anything to do with it huck_creeps huck_finn
all he got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out you dont have to be able to read it
why half the time you cant read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate or anywhere else well then what the sense in wasting the plates
why blame it all it aint the prisoner plates but it somebody plates aint it well spos it is
what does the prisoner care whose he broke off there because we heard the breakfast horn blowing so we cleared out for the house
along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothe line and i found an old sack and put them in it and we went down and got the fox fire and put that in too
i called it borrowing because that was what pap always called it but jim_tom_sawyer said it warnt borrowing it was stealing
he said we was representing prisoners and prisoners dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobody dont blame them for it either
it aint no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with jim_tom_sawyer said it his right and so as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with
he said if we warnt prisoners it would be a very different thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he warnt a prisoner
and yet he made a mighty fuss one day after that when i stole a watermelon out of the nigger patch and eat it and he made me go and give the nigger a dime without telling them what it was for
so we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy jim_tom_sawyer said that what he meant was we could steal anything we needed
well i says i needed the watermelon but he said i didnt need it to get out of prison with there where the difference was
he said if i a wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to jim_tom_sawyer to kill the seneskal with it would a been all right
so i let it go at that though i couldnt see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold leaf distinctions like that every time i see a chance to hog a watermelon
well as i was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business and nobody in sight around the yard then jim_tom_sawyer he carried the sack into the lean to whilst i stood off a piece to keep watch
by and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk he says everything all right now except tools and that easy fixed
tools i says yes tools for what why to dig with we aint a going to gnaw him out are we
aint them old crippled picks and thing in there good enough to dig a nigger out with i says
he turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and says huck_creeps huck_finn did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with
now i want to ask you if you got any reasonableness in you at all what kind of a show would that give him to be a hero
why they might as well lend him the key and done with it picks and shovels why they wouldnt furnish em to a king
well then i says if we dont want the picks and shovels what do we want a couple of case knives
to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with yes confound it it foolish jim_tom_sawyer it dont make no difference
how foolish it is it the right way and it the regular way and there aint no other way that ever i heard of and i ve read all the book that gives any information about these thing
they always dig out with a case knife and not through dirt mind you generly it through solid rock and it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks and for ever and ever
why look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the castle deef in the harbor of marseilles that dug himself out that way
how long was he at it you reckon i dont know well guess i dont know a month and a half
thirty seven year and he come out in china that the kind i wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock
jim_tom_sawyer dont know nobody in china what that got to do with it neither did that other fellow
but you re always a wandering off on a side issue why cant you stick to the main point all right i dont care where he comes out so he comes out and jim_tom_sawyer dont either i reckon
but there one thing anyway jim_tom_sawyer too old to be dug out with a case knife he wont last yes he will last too
you dont reckon it going to take thirty seven year to dig out through a dirt foundation do you how long will it take jim_tom_sawyer
well we cant resk being as long as we ought to because it maynt take very long for uncle_silas to hear from down there by new orleans
he ll hear jim_tom_sawyer aint from there then his next move will be to advertise jim_tom_sawyer or something like that so we cant resk being as long digging him out as we ought to
thing being so uncertain what i recommend is this that we really dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can let on to ourselves that we was at it thirty seven year
by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of year but we cant then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there an alarm
letting on dont cost nothing letting on aint no trouble and if it any object i dont mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year
yes i reckon that ll be the best way now there sense in that i says it wouldnt strain me none after i got my hand in
so i ll mosey along now and smouch a couple of case knives smouch three he says we want one to make a saw out of
jim_tom_sawyer if it aint unregular and irreligious to sejest it i says there an old rusty saw blade around yonder sticking under the weather boarding behind the smoke house
he looked kind of weary and discouraged like and says it aint no use to try to learn you nothing huck_creeps
run along and smouch the knives three of them so i done it chapter xxxvi as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep
that night we went down the lightning rod and shut ourselves up in the lean to and got out our pile of fox fire and went to work
jim_tom_sawyer said he was right behind jim_tom_sawyer bed now and we dig in under it and when we got through there couldnt nobody in the cabin
ever know there was any hole there because jim_tom_sawyer counter pin hung down most to the ground and you have to raise it up and look under to see the hole
so we dug and dug with the case knives till most midnight and then we was dog tired and our hand was blistered and yet you couldnt see we done anything hardly
we cleared everything out of the way about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log at last i says this aint no thirty seven year job this is a thirty eight year job jim_tom_sawyer
but he sighed and pretty soon he stopped digging and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking
if we was prisoners it would because then we have as many year as we wanted and no hurry and we wouldnt get but
a few minute to dig every day while they was changing watches and so our hand wouldnt get blistered and we could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the way it ought to be done
he never said nothing then he says it aint no use huck_creeps it aint a going to work but we cant fool along we got to rush we aint got no time to spare
if we was to put in another night this way we have to knock off for a week to let our hand get well couldnt touch a case knife with them sooner
it aint right and it aint moral and i wouldnt like it to get out but there aint only just the one way
well then what we going to do jim_tom_sawyer i ll tell you we got to dig him out with the picks and let on it case knives
now you re talking i says your head gets leveler and leveler all the time jim_tom_sawyer i says
picks is the thing moral or no moral and as for me i dont care shucks for the morality of it nohow
when i start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sunday school book i aint no way particular how it done
what i want is my nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is my sunday school book and if a pick the handiest thing that the thing i a going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sunday school book out with and i dont give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther
so it done well he says there excuse for picks and letting on in a case like this if it warn t
so i wouldnt approve of it nor i wouldnt stand by and see the rules broke because right is right and wrong is wrong and a body aint got no business doing wrong when he aint ignorant and knows better
it might answer for you to dig jim_tom_sawyer out with a pick without any letting on because you dont know no better but it wouldnt for me because i do know better
gimme a case knife he had his own by him but i handed him mine he flung it down and says gimme a case knife
i scratched around amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he took it and went to work and never said a word
i didnt know just what to do but then i thought he was always just that particular full of principle so then i got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn about and made the fur fly
we stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it
when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see jim_tom_sawyer doing his level best with the lightning rod but he couldnt come it his hand was so sore
at last he says it aint no use it cant be done what you reckon i better do cant you think of no way
yes i says but i reckon it aint regular come up the stairs and let on it a lightning rod
next day jim_tom_sawyer stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house for to make some pens for jim_tom_sawyer out of and six tallow candle and i hung around the nigger cabin and laid for a chance and stole three tin plates
jim_tom_sawyer says it wasnt enough but i said nobody wouldnt ever see the plates that jim_tom_sawyer throwed out because they fall in the dog fennel and jimpson weeds under the window hole then we could tote them back and he could use them over again
so he done it so jim_tom_sawyer was satisfied then he says now the thing to study out is how to get the thing to jim_tom_sawyer
he only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying
by and by he said he had ciphered out two or three way but there warnt no need to decide on any of them yet
take them in through the hole i says when we get it done said we got to post jim_tom_sawyer first
that night we went down the lightning rod a little after ten and took one of the candle along and listened under the window hole and heard jim_tom_sawyer snoring so we pitched it in and it didnt wake him
then we whirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hour and a half the job was done
we crept in under jim_tom_sawyer bed and into the cabin and pawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over jim_tom_sawyer awhile and found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentle and gradual
he was so glad to see us he most cried and called us honey and all the pet name he could think of and was for having us hunt up a cold chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away and clearing out without losing any time
but jim_tom_sawyer he showed him how unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plans and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm and not to be the least afraid because we would see he got away sure
so jim_tom_sawyer he said it was all right and we set there and talked over old time awhile and then jim_tom_sawyer asked a lot of questions and
when jim_tom_sawyer told him uncle_silas come in every day or two to pray with him and aunt_sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat and both of them was kind as they could be jim_tom_sawyer says now i know how to fix it
i said dont do nothing of the kind it one of the most jackass ideas i ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went right on
so he told jim_tom_sawyer how we have to smuggle in the rope ladder pie and other large thing by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the lookout and not be surprised and not let nat see him open them and we would put small thing in uncle coat pockets and he must steal them out and we would tie thing to aunt apron strings or put them in her apron pocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be and what they was for
we ll send you some thing by them it was his way when he got his plans set and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood and all that
jim_tom_sawyer he couldnt see no sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all just as jim_tom_sawyer said
jim_tom_sawyer had plenty corn cob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down good sociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home to bed with hand that looked like they been chawed
he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim_tom_sawyer to our children to get out for he believed jim_tom_sawyer would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it
he said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year and would be the best time on record
he told him everything jim_tom_sawyer was in high spirits and he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it
in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes and jim_tom_sawyer put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket
then we went to the nigger cabin and while i got nat notice off jim_tom_sawyer shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn pone that was in jim_tom_sawyer pan and we went along with nat to see how it would work and it just worked noble when jim_tom_sawyer bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out and there warnt ever anything could a worked better
but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that always getting into bread you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four place first
and whilst we was a standing there in the dimmish light here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under jim_tom_sawyer bed and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hardly room in there to get your breath
jim_tom_sawyer said so himself jim_tom_sawyer he never let on by jings we forgot to fasten that lean to door the nigger nat
he only just hollered witches once and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dog and begun to groan like he was dying
jim_tom_sawyer jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jim_tom_sawyer meat and the dog went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door and i knowed he fixed the other door too
then he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him and asking him if he been imagining he saw something again
he raised up and blinked his eye around and says mars_sid you ll say i a fool but if i didnt lieve i see most a million dog er devils er
some i wisht i may die right heah in dese tracks i did mos sholy mars_sid i felt um i felt um sah dey was all over me
dad fetch it i jis wisht i could git my han on one er dem witches jis wunst on jis wunst it all i ast
but mos ly i wisht dey lemme lone i does jim_tom_sawyer says well i tell you what i think what makes them come here just at this runaway nigger breakfast time
it because they re hungry that the reason you make them a witch pie that the thing for you to do
but my lan mars_sid how i gwyne to make a witch pie i doan know how to make it
i haint ever hearn er sich a thing fo well then i ll have to make it myself will you do it honey will you
i ll wusshup de groun und yo foot i will all right i ll do it seeing it you and you ve been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger
when we come around you turn your back and then whatever we ve put in the pan dont you let on you see it at all
but you got to be mighty careful and dont you look when jim_tom_sawyer unloads the pan something might happen i dont know what
and above all dont you handle the witch thing hannel mars_sid what is you a talkin bout i wouldn lay de weight er my finger on um not r ten hund thous billion dollar i wouldnt
so then we went away and went to the rubbage pile in the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and piece of bottles and wore out tin thing and all such truck and scratched around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shingle nails that jim_tom_sawyer said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in aunt_sally apron pocket which was hanging on a chair andt other we stuck in the band of uncle_silas hat which was on the bureau because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger house this morning and then went to breakfast and jim_tom_sawyer dropped the pewter spoon in uncle_silas coat pocket and aunt_sally wasnt come yet so we had to wait a little while
and when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hardly wait for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child head with her thimble with the other and says i ve hunted high and i ve hunted low and it does beat all what has become of your other shirt
my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and thing and a hard piece of corn crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing worm and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop
and jim_tom_sawyer he turned kinder blue around the gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of thing for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that and i would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder
but after that we was all right again it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold
chapter xxxvii that was all fixed uncle_silas he says it most uncommon curious i cant understand it i know
perfectly well i took it off because because you haint got but one on just listen at the man
i know you took it off and know it by a better way than your wool gethering memory too because it was on the clo line yesterday i see it there myself
but it gone that the long and the short of it and you ll just have to change to a red flann one till i can get time to make a new one
it just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage to do with m
and it ll be the third i ve made in two year all is more i can make out a body think you would learn to take some sort of care of em at your time of life
but it oughtnt to be altogether my fault because you know i dont see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they re on me and i dont believe i ve ever lost one of them off of me
i know it aunt_sally and i do try all i can well it aint your fault if you havent uncle_silas you a done it if you could i reckon
and the shirt aint all that gone nuther ther a spoon gone and that aint all there was ten and now ther only nine
the calf got the shirt i reckon but the calf never took the spoon that certain why what else is gone aunt_sally
the rat could a got the candle and i reckon they did i wonder they dont walk off with the whole place the way you re always going to stop their holes and dont do it and if they warnt fools they sleep in your hair
ther six candle gone that what uncle_silas you never find it out but you cant lay the spoon on the rat and that i know
well aunt_sally i in fault and i acknowledge it i ve been remiss but i wont let to morrow go by without stopping up them holes
oh i wouldnt hurry next year ll do matilda angelina araminta phelps whack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar bowl without fooling around any
just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage and says missus dey a sheet gone a sheet gone
well for the land sake i ll stop up them holes to day says uncle_silas looking sorrowful oh do shet up pose the rat took the sheet
where it gone lize clah to goodness i haint no notion miss aunt_sally she wuz on de clo sline yistiddy but she done gone she ain dah no mo now
i reckon the world is coming to an end i never see the beat of it in all my born day
a shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six can missus comes a young yaller wench dey a brass cannelstick miss
cler out from here you hussy er i ll take a skillet to ye well she was just a biling
i begun to lay for a chance i reckoned i would sneak out and go for the wood till the weather moderated
she kept a raging right along running her insurrection all by herself and everybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last uncle_silas looking kind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket
she stopped with her mouth open and her hand up and as for me i wished i was in jeruslem or somewheres
so you had it in your pocket all the time and like as not you ve got the other thing there too
but not long because she says it just as i expected how it get there i reely dont know aunt_sally he says kind of apologizing or you know i would tell
i was a studying over my text in acts seventeen before breakfast and i reckon i put it in there not noticing meaning to put my testament in and it must be so because my testament aint in but i ll go and see and if the testament is where i had it i ll know i didnt put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon and
go long now the whole kit and biling of ye and dont come nigh me again till i ve got back my peace of mind
if she a said it to herself let alone speaking it out and i a got up and obeyed her if i a been dead
as we was passing through the setting room the old man he took up his hat and the shingle nail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel shelf and never said nothing and went out
jim_tom_sawyer see him do it and remembered about the spoon and says well it aint no use to send thing by him no more he aint reliable
then he says but he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway without knowing it and so we ll go and do him one without him knowing it stop up his rat holes
there was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape
then we heard steps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comes the old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff int other looking as absent minded as year before last
oh for the land sake give a body a rest i a heard her he went a mooning around first to one rat hole and then another till he been to them all
then he stood about five minute picking tallow drip off of his candle and thinking then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs saying well for the life of me
i cant remember when i done it i could show her now that i warnt to blame on account of the rat
but never mind let it go i reckon it wouldnt do no good and so he went on a mumbling up stairs and then we left
jim_tom_sawyer was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he said we got to have it so he took a think
when he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do then we went and waited around the spoon basket till we see aunt_sally coming and then jim_tom_sawyer went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side and i slid one of them up my sleeve and jim_tom_sawyer says why aunt_sally there aint but nine spoons yet
he was a mighty nice old man and always is she says go long to your play and dont bother me
i know better i counted myself well i ve counted them twice aunty and i cant make but nine
she looked out of all patience but of course she come to count anybody would i declare to gracious ther aint but nine
so i slipped back the one i had and when she got done counting she says hang the troublesome rubbage ther ten now and she looked huffy and bothered both
she says why what in the world plague take the thing i ll count again but jim_tom_sawyer says why aunty i dont think there ten
you numskull didnt you see me count i know but well i ll count again
so i smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time well she was in a tearing way just a trembling all over she was so mad
she start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three time they come out right and three time they come out wrong
then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley west and she said cle out and let her have some peace and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she skin us
so we had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apron pocket whilst she was a giving us our sailing orders and jim_tom_sawyer got it all right along with her shingle nail before noon
we was very well satisfied with this business and jim_tom_sawyer allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took because he said now she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life and wouldnt believe she counted them right if she did and said that after she about counted her head off for the next three day he judged she give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more
so we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of day till she didnt know how many sheets she had any more and she didnt care and warnt a going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her life
so we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candle by the help of the calf and the rat and the mixed up counting and as to the candlestick it warn t
but she counted and counted till she got that addled she druther die first no consequence it would blow over by and by
we fixed it up away down in the wood and cooked it there and we got it done at last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and we had to use up three wash pans full of flour before we got through and we got burnt pretty much all over in place and eye put out with the smoke because you see we didnt want nothing but a crust and we couldnt prop it up right and she would always cave in
but that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie but of course we thought of the right way at last which was to cook the ladder too in the pie
so then we laid in with jim_tom_sawyer the second night and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with
we let on it took nine months to make it and in the forenoon we took it down to the wood but it wouldnt go into the pie
being made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough for forty pies if we a wanted them and plenty left over for soup or sausage or anything you choose
we could a had a whole dinner but we didnt need it all we needed was just enough for the pie and so we throwed the rest away
we didnt cook none of the pies in the wash pan afraid the solder would melt but uncle_silas he had a noble brass warming pan which he thought considerable of because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from england with william_fourth the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up
garret with a lot of other old pots and thing that was valuable not on account of being any account because they warn t
but on account of them being relicts you know and we snaked her out private and took her down there but she failed on the first pies because we didnt know how but she come up smiling on the last one
we took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals and loaded her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the long handle cool and comfortable and in fifteen minute she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at
but the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that rope ladder wouldnt cramp him down to business
i dont know nothing what i talking about and lay him in enough stomach ache to last him till next time too
nat didnt look when we put the witch pie in jim_tom_sawyer pan and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so jim_tom_sawyer got everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window hole
making them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and jim_tom_sawyer allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all
but he had to have it jim_tom_sawyer said he got to there warnt no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of arm
chapter xxxviii that the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall look at lady jane grey he says look at gilford dudley look at old northumberland
why huck_creeps pose it is considerble trouble what you going to do how you going to get around it jim_tom_sawyer got to do his inscription and coat of arm
jim_tom_sawyer says why mars jim_tom_sawyer i haint got no coat arm i haint got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat
they all do oh you dont understand jim_tom_sawyer a coat of arm is very different well i says jim_tom_sawyer right anyway when he says he aint got no coat of arm because he haint
i reckon i knowed that jim_tom_sawyer says but you bet he ll have one before he goes out of this because he going out right and there aint going to be no flaws in his record
so whilst me and jim_tom_sawyer filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece jim_tom_sawyer a making his out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon jim_tom_sawyer set to work to think out the coat of arm
by and by he said he struck so many good one he didnt hardly know which to take but there was one which he reckoned he decide on
he says on the scutcheon we ll have a bend or in the dexter base a saltire murrey in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and under his foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed and three invected line on a field azure with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway nigger sable with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and a couple of gules for supporters which is you and me motto maggiore fretta minore otto
got it out of a book means the more haste the less speed geewhillikins i says but what does the rest of it mean
we aint got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig in like all git out well anyway i says what some of it
what a fess a fess a fess is you dont need to know what a fess is i ll show him how to make it when he gets to it
shucks jim_tom_sawyer i says i think you might tell a person what a bar sinister oh i dont know but he got to have it
all the nobility does that was just his way if it didnt suit him to explain a thing to you he wouldnt do it
he got all that coat of arm business fixed so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out a mournful inscription said jim_tom_sawyer got to have one like they all done
you might pump at him a week it wouldnt make no difference he made up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so
here a captive heart busted here a poor prisoner forsook by the world and friends fretted his sorrowful life
here a lonely heart broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirty seven year of solitary captivity
here homeless and friendless after thirty seven year of bitter captivity perished a noble stranger natural son of louis xiv jim_tom_sawyer voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke down
when he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for jim_tom_sawyer to scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on
jim_tom_sawyer said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the log with a nail and he didnt know how to make letters besides but jim_tom_sawyer said he would block them out for him and then he wouldnt have nothing to do but just follow the line
then pretty soon he says come to think the log aint a going to do they dont have log walls in a dungeon we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock
jim_tom_sawyer said the rock was worse than the log he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out
we ll fetch a rock but jim_tom_sawyer said he would let me help him do it then he took a look to see how me and jim_tom_sawyer was getting along with the pens
it was most pesky tedious hard work and slow and didnt give my hand no show to get well of the sores and we didnt seem to make no headway hardly so jim_tom_sawyer says i know how to fix it
we got to have a rock for the coat of arm and mournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rock
there a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and we ll smouch it and carve the thing on it and file out the pens and the saw on it too
it warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindstone nuther but we allowed we tackle it
it warnt quite midnight yet so we cleared out for the mill leaving jim_tom_sawyer at work we smouched the grindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation tough job
sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her from falling over and she come mighty near mashing us every time
jim_tom_sawyer said she was going to get one of us sure before we got through we got her half way and then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat
so he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed leg and wrapt it round and round his neck and we crawled out through our hole and down there and jim_tom_sawyer and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing and jim_tom_sawyer superintended
we see it warnt no use we got to go and fetch jim_tom_sawyer he could out superintend any boy i ever see
our hole was pretty big but it warnt big enough to get the grindstone through but jim_tom_sawyer he took the pick and soon made it big enough
then jim_tom_sawyer marked out them thing on it with the nail and set jim_tom_sawyer to work on them with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean to for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it
he knowed how to do everything then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed leg and was ready for bed ourselves
but jim_tom_sawyer thought of something and says you got any spiders in here jim_tom_sawyer no sah thanks to goodness i hain t
mars jim_tom_sawyer all right we ll get you some but bless you honey i doan want none i afeard un um
i jis soon have rattlesnakes aroun jim_tom_sawyer thought a minute or two and says it a good idea and i reckon it been done
it must a been done it stands to reason yes it a prime good idea where could you keep it keep what mars jim_tom_sawyer
why a rattlesnake de goodness gracious alive mars jim_tom_sawyer why if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah
i take en bust right out thoo dat log wall i would wid my head why jim_tom_sawyer you wouldnt be afraid of it after a little

why you can get him so in a little while that he ll love you and sleep with you and wont stay away from you a minute and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth
any book will tell you that you try that all i ask just try for two or three day please mars jim_tom_sawyer doan talk so
i cant stan it he let me shove his head in my mouf fer a favor haint it i lay he wait a pow ful long time fo i ast him
a prisoner got to have some kind of a dumb pet and if a rattlesnake haint ever been tried why there more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life
en mo en dat i doan want him to sleep wid me jim_tom_sawyer dont act so foolish why mars jim_tom_sawyer i doan want no sich glory

so dont make no more fuss about it prisoners aint ever without rat there aint no instance of it and they train them and pet them and learn them tricks and they get to be as sociable as flies
but you got to play music to them you got anything to play music on i ain got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece paper en a juice harp but
i reck dey wouldn take no stock in a juice harp yes they would they dont care what kind of music tis
a jews harp plenty good enough for a rat all animals like music in a prison they dote on it specially painful music and you cant get no other kind out of a jews harp
it always interests them they come out to see what the matter with you yes you re all right you re fixed very well
you want to set on your bed night before you go to sleep and early in the morning and play your jews harp play
quicker anything else and when you ve played about two minute you ll see all the rat and the snake and spiders and thing begin to feel worried about you and come
the last link is broken that the thing that ll scoop a rat and they ll just fairly swarm over you and have a noble good time
yes dey will i reck mars jim_tom_sawyer but what kine er time is jim_tom_sawyer havin blest if i kin see de pint
but i ll do it ef i got to i reck i better keep de animals satisfied en not have no trouble in de house
jim_tom_sawyer waited to think it over and see if there wasnt nothing else and pretty soon he says oh there one thing i forgot
could you raise a flower here do you reckon i doan know but maybe i could mars jim_tom_sawyer but it tolable dark in heah en
i ain got no use r no flower nohow en she be a pow ful sight trouble well you try it anyway
some other prisoners has done it one er dem big cat tail lookin mullen stalks would grow in heah mars jim_tom_sawyer i reck but she wouldnt be wuth half de trouble she coss
dont you believe it we ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there and raise it
and dont call it mullen call it pitchiola that its right name when it in a prison and you want to water it with your tears
why i got plenty spring water mars jim_tom_sawyer you dont want spring water you want to water it with your tears
it the way they always do why mars jim_tom_sawyer i lay i kin raise one er dem mullen stalks twyste wid
spring water whiles another man a start one wid tears that aint the idea you got to do it with tears
she ll die on my han mars jim_tom_sawyer she sholy will kase i doan skasely ever cry so jim_tom_sawyer was stumped
but he studied it over and then said jim_tom_sawyer would have to worry along the best he could with an onion
jim_tom_sawyer said he would jis soon have tobacker in his coffee and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of raising the mullen and jews harping the rat and petting and flattering up the snake and spiders and thing on top of all the other work he had to do on pens and inscriptions and journals and thing which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook that jim_tom_sawyer most lost all patience with him and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chance than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself and yet he didnt know enough to appreciate them and they was just about wasted on him
so jim_tom_sawyer he was sorry and said he wouldnt behave so no more and then me and jim_tom_sawyer shoved for bed
he promised he would go to the nigger cabin and drop one private in jim_tom_sawyer coffee pot in the morning chapter xxxix
in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat trap and fetched it down and unstopped the best rat hole and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of one and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt_sally bed
little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found it there and opened the door of it to see if the rat would come out and they did and aunt_sally she come in and when we got back she was a standing on top of the bed raising cain and the rat was doing what they could to keep off the dull time for her
so she took and dusted us both with the hickry and we was as much as two hour catching another fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warnt the likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock
but while we was gone for spiders i never see a likelier lot of rat than what that first haul was
we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs and caterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornet nest but we didnt
we didnt give it right up but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed we tire them out
the family was at home or they got to tire us out and they done it then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the place and was pretty near
and so we went for the snake and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house snake and put them in a bag and put it in our room and by that time it was supper time and a rattling good honest day work and hungry oh no
all right again but couldnt set down convenient i reckon not and there warnt a blessed snake up there when we went back we didnt half tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left
but it didnt matter much because they was still on the premises somewheres so we judged we could get some of them again
you see them dripping from the rafters and place every now and then and they generly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of the time where you didnt want them
well they was handsome and striped and there warnt no harm in a million of them but that never made no difference to aunt_sally
she despised snake be the breed what they might and she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it and every time one of them flopped down on her it didnt make no difference what she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out
no there warnt no real scarcity of snake about the house for a considerable spell i never see such a woman
and you could hear her whoop to jericho you couldnt get her to take a holt of one of them with the tongs
and if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire
why after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week aunt_sally
warnt over it yet she warnt near over it when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather
she disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadnt ever been no snake created and she would jump right out of her stockings
it was very curious but jim_tom_sawyer said all woman was just so he said they was made that way for some reason or other
we got a licking every time one of our snake come in her way and she allowed these lickings warnt nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them
i didnt mind the lickings because they didnt amount to nothing but i minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot
but we got them laid in and all the other thing and you never see a cabin as blithesome as jim_tom_sawyer was when they all swarm out for music and go for him
jim_tom_sawyer didnt like the spiders and the spiders didnt like jim_tom_sawyer and so they lay for him and make it mighty warm for him
and he said that between the rat and the snake and the grindstone there warnt no room in bed for him skasely and when there was a body couldnt sleep it was so lively and it was always lively he said because they never all slept at one time but took turn about so when the snake was asleep the rat was on deck and when the rat turned in the snake come on watch
so he always had one gang under him in his way andt other gang having a circus over him and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over
he said if he ever got out this time he wouldnt ever be a prisoner again not for a salary well by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape
the shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit jim_tom_sawyer he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone the bed leg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdust and it give us a most amazing stomach ache
we reckoned we was all going to die but didnt it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see and jim_tom_sawyer said the same
but as i was saying we got all the work done now at last and we was all pretty much fagged out too but mainly jim_tom_sawyer
the old man had wrote a couple of time to the plantation below orleans to come and get their runaway nigger but hadnt got no answer because there warnt no such plantation so he allowed he would advertise jim_tom_sawyer in the st louis and new orleans papers and when he mentioned the st louis one it give me the cold shivers and i see we hadnt no time to lose
so jim_tom_sawyer said now for the nonnamous letters what them i says warnings to the people that something is up
sometimes it done one way sometimes another but there always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle
when louis xvi was going to light out of the tooleries a servant girl done it it a very good way and so is the nonnamous letters
and it usual for the prisoner mother to change clothe with him and she stays in and he slides out in her clothe
we ll use them both we ll do that too but looky here jim_tom_sawyer what do we want to warn anybody for that something up
let them find it out for themselves it their lookout yes i know but you cant depend on them it the way they ve acted from the very start left us to do everything
so if we dont give them notice there wont be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ll go off perfectly flat wont amount to nothing wont be nothing to it
they re so confiding and mullet headed they dont take notice of nothing at all well as for me jim_tom_sawyer that the way i like
shucks he says and looked disgusted so i says but i aint going to make no complaint any way that suits you suits me
what you going to do about the servant girl you ll be her you slide in in the middle of the night and hook that yaller girl frock
i know but you dont want it but fifteen minute to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door
why jim_tom_sawyer that ll make trouble next morning because of course she prob bly haint got any but that one
all right then i ll do it but i could carry it just as handy in my own togs you wouldnt look like a servant girl then would you
no but there wont be nobody to see what i look like anyway that aint got nothing to do with it
the thing for us to do is just to do our duty and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not
haint you got no principle at all all right i aint saying nothing i the servant girl who jim_tom_sawyer mother i his mother
i ll hook a gown from aunt_sally well then you ll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim_tom_sawyer leaves
i ll stuff jim_tom_sawyer clothe full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise and jim_tom_sawyer ll take the nigger woman gown off of me and wear it and we ll all evade together
not much when a prisoner of style escapes it called an evasion it always called so when a king escapes rinstance
and the same with a king son it dont make no difference whether he a natural one or an unnatural one
so jim_tom_sawyer he wrote the nonnamous letter and i smouched the yaller wench frock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door the way jim_tom_sawyer told me to
next night we stuck a picture which jim_tom_sawyer drawed in blood of a skull and crossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin on the back door
it said beware trouble is brewing keep a sharp lookout unknown friend i never see a family in such a sweat
they couldnt a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the bed and shivering through the air
if a door banged aunt_sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fell she jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her when she warnt noticing she done the same she couldnt face noway and be satisfied because she allowed there was something behind her every time so she was always a whirling around sudden and saying ouch and before she got two thirds around
she whirl back again and say it again and she was afraid to go to bed but she dasnt set up
so the thing was working very well jim_tom_sawyer said he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory he said it showed it was done right
so the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what we better do with it because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both door all night
jim_tom_sawyer he went down the lightning rod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleep and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back
there is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway nigger to night and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them
i am one of the gang but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again and will betray the helish design
they will sneak down from northards along the fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in the nigger cabin to get him
i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any danger but stead of that i will baa like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all
then whilst they are getting his chains loose you slip there and lock them in and can kill them at your leasure
so he said now for the grand bulge this letter said dont betray me i wish to be your friend dont do anything
but just the way i am telling you if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop jamboreehoo i do not wish any reward but to know i have done the right thing
we was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and went over the river a fishing with a lunch and had a good time and took a look at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supper and found them in such a sweat and worry they didnt know which end they was standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper and wouldnt tell us what the trouble was and never let on a word about the new letter but didnt need to because we knowed as much about it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up about half past eleven and jim_tom_sawyer put on aunt_sally dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch but says where the butter
unknown friend chapter xl i laid out a hunk of it i says on a piece of a corn pone well you left it laid out then
it aint here we can get along without it i says we can get along with it too he says just you slide down cellar and fetch it
i ll go and stuff the straw into jim_tom_sawyer clothe to represent his mother in disguise and be ready to baa like a sheep and shove soon as you get there
the hunk of butter big as a person fist was where i had left it so i took up the slab of corn pone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairs very stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comes aunt_sally with a candle and i clapped the truck in my hat and clapped my hat on my head and the next second she see me and she says you been down cellar
and then mosey right down the lightning rod and come along so out he went and down cellar went i yes
what you been doing down there noth noth no well then what possessed you to go down there this time of night
i dont know you dont know dont answer me that way jim_tom_sawyer i want to know what you been doing down there
i reckoned she let me go now and as a generl thing she would but i pose there was so many strange thing going on
she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warnt yard stick straight so she says very decided you just march into that setting room and stay there till i come
you been up to something you no business to and i lay i ll find out what it is before i done with you
i haint been doing a single thing aunt_sally i hope to gracious if i have so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the setting room
my but there was a crowd there fifteen farmers and every one of them had a gun i was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set down
they was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voice and all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warnt but i knowed they was because they was always taking off their hats and putting them on and scratching their head and changing their seats and fumbling with their buttons
i did wish aunt_sally would come and get done with me and lick me if she wanted to and let me get away and tell jim_tom_sawyer how we overdone this thing and what a thundering hornet nest
we got ourselves into so we could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with jim_tom_sawyer before these rips got out of patience and come for us
i warnt easy myself but i didnt take my hat off all the same at last she come and begun to ask me questions but i couldnt answer them straight
i didnt know which end of me was up because these man was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes and saying it warn t
but a few minute to midnight and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep signal and here was aunty pegging away at the questions and me a shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks
i was that scared and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears and pretty soon when one of them says i for going and getting in the cabin first and right now and catching them when they come i most dropped and a streak of butter come a trickling down my forehead and aunt_sally she see it and turns white as a sheet and says for the land sake what is the matter with the child
and everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me and hugged me and says oh what a turn you did give me
he got the brain fever as shore as you re born and they re oozing out and how glad and grateful i am it
aint no worse for luck against us and it never rains but it pours and when i see that truck i thought we lost you for i knowed by the color and
all it was just like your brains would be if dear dear whyd nt you tell me that was what you been down there for i wouldnt a cared
i was up stairs in a second and down the lightning rod in another one and shinning through the dark for the lean to
i couldnt hardly get my word out i was so anxious but i told jim_tom_sawyer as quick as i could we must jump for it now and not a minute to lose the house full of man yonder with gun
now cler out to bed and dont lemme see no more of you till morning his eye just blazed and he says no is that so
aint it bully why huck_creeps if it was to do over again i bet i could fetch two hundred if we could put it off till
hurry hurry i says where jim_tom_sawyer right at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him
but then we heard the tramp of man coming to the door and heard them begin to fumble with the pad lock and heard a man say i told you we be too soon they havent come the door is locked
here i ll lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for em in the dark and kill em when they come and the rest scatter around a piece and listen if you can hear em coming
so in they come but couldnt see us in the dark and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed
he dressed and everything ready now we ll slide out and give the sheep signal but we got under all right and out through the hole swift but soft
jim_tom_sawyer first me next and jim_tom_sawyer last which was according to jim_tom_sawyer orders now we was in the lean to and heard trampings close by outside
so we crept to the door and jim_tom_sawyer stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldnt make out nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further and when he nudged us jim_tom_sawyer must glide out first and him last
so he set his ear to the crack and listened and listened and listened and the steps a scraping around out there all the time and at last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped down not breathing and not making the least noise and slipped stealthy towards the fence in injun file and got to it all right and me and jim_tom_sawyer over it
but jim_tom_sawyer britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the steps coming so he had to pull loose which snapped the splinter and made a noise and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out who that
answer or i ll shoot but we didnt answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved then there was a rush and a bang bang bang and the bullets fairly whizzed around us
we heard them sing out here they are they ve broke for the river after em boy and turn loose the dog
so here they come full tilt we could hear them because they wore boots and yelled but we didnt wear no boots and didnt yell
we was in the path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behind them
they had all the dog shut up so they wouldnt scare off the robbers but by this time somebody had let them loose and here they come making powwow enough for a million but they was our dog so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up and when they see it warnt nobody but us and no excitement to offer them they only just said howdy and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering and then we up steam again and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river but didnt make no more noise than we was obleeged to
then we struck out easy and comfortable for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out
and when we stepped on to the raft i says now old jim_tom_sawyer you re a free man again and i bet you wont ever be a slave no more
en a mighty good job it wuz too huck_creeps it uz planned beautiful en it uz done beautiful en dey aint nobody kin git up
we was all glad as we could be but jim_tom_sawyer was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg
a plan dat mo mixed up en splendid den what dat one wuz when me and jim_tom_sawyer heard that we didnt feel so brash as what we did before
it was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke shirts for to bandage him but he says gimme the rags i can do it myself
dont stop now dont fool around here and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and set her loose
there wouldnt a been no son of saint louis ascend to heaven wrote down in his biography no sir we a whooped him over the border
boy we done it elegant deed we did i wish we a had the handling of louis xvi that what we d
a done with him and done it just as slick as nothing at all too man the sweeps man the sweeps
but me and jim_tom_sawyer was consulting and thinking and after we thought a minute i says say it jim_tom_sawyer so he says well den dis is de way it look to me huck_creeps
dat uz bein sot free en one er de boy wuz to git shot would he say go on en save me nemmine bout a doctor r to save dis one
ef it wuz him is dat like mars jim_tom_sawyer would he say dat you bet he wouldnt well den is jim_tom_sawyer gywne to say it
i knowed he was white inside and i reckoned he say what he did say so it was all right now and
no sah i doan budge a step out dis place dout a doctor not if it forty year i told jim_tom_sawyer i was a going for a doctor
he raised considerable row about it but me and jim_tom_sawyer stuck to it and wouldnt budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself but we wouldnt let him
so when he sees me getting the canoe ready he says well then if you re bound to go i ll tell you the way to do when you get to the village
shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purse full of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in the canoe in a roundabout way amongst the island and search him and take his chalk away from him and dont give it back to him till you get him back to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again
then he give us a piece of his mind but it didnt do no good it the way they all do
so i said i would and left and jim_tom_sawyer was to hide in the wood when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again
i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting yesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off and shot him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks
chapter xli the doctor was an old man a very nice kind looking old man when i got him up
who is your folks he says the phelpses down yonder oh he says and after a minute he says how you say he got shot
he had a dream i says and it shot him singular dream he says so he lit up his lantern and got his saddle bags and we started
but when he sees the canoe he didnt like the look of her said she was big enough for one but didnt look pretty safe for two
i says oh you neednt be afeard sir she carried the three of us easy enough what three why me and mars_sid and and and the gun that what i mean
but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his head and said he reckoned he look around for a bigger one
but they was all locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he come back or i could hunt around further or maybe i better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to
oh he says but i said i didnt so i told him just how to find the raft and then he started
i struck an idea pretty soon i says to myself spos he cant fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep tail as the saying is
spos it takes him three or four day what are we going to do lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag
no sir i know what i ll do i ll wait and when he comes back if he says he got to go any more
i ll get down there too if i swim and we ll take and tie him and keep him and shove out down the river and when jim_tom_sawyer done with him we ll give him what it worth or all we got and then let him get ashore
so then i crept into a lumber pile to get some sleep and next time i waked up the sun was away up over my head
i shot out and went for the doctor house but they told me he gone away in the night some time or other and warnt back yet
well thinks i that looks powerful bad for jim_tom_sawyer and i ll dig out for the island right off so away i shoved and turned the corner and nearly rammed my head into uncle_silas stomach
he says why jim_tom_sawyer where you been all this time you rascal i haint been nowheres i says only just hunting for the runaway nigger me and mars_sid
why where ever did you go he says your aunt been mighty uneasy she neednt i says because we was all right
we followed the man and the dog but they outrun us and we lost them but we thought we heard them on the water so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over but couldnt find nothing of them so we cruised along up shore till we got kind of tired and beat out and tied up the canoe and went to sleep and never waked up till about an hour ago then we paddled over here to hear the news and mars_sid at the post office to see what he can hear and i a branching out to get something to eat for us and then we re going home
the old man he got a letter out of the office and we waited awhile longer but mars_sid didnt come so the old man said come along let mars_sid foot it home or canoe it when he got done fooling around but we would ride
i couldnt get him to let me stay and wait for mars_sid and he said there warnt no use in it and i must come along and let aunt_sally see we was all right
when we got home aunt_sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both and hugged me and give me one of them lickings of hern that dont amount to shucks and said she serve mars_sid the same when he come
and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers wives to dinner and such another clack a body never heard
so then we went to the post office to get mars_sid but just as i suspicioned he warnt there so old mrs hotchkiss was the worst her tongue was a going all the time
she says well sister phelps i ve ransacked that air cabin over an i lieve the nigger was crazy i says to sister damrell

why they ve stole everything they could lay their hand on and we a watching all the time mind you they stole that shirt right off the line
nt no telling how many time they didnt steal that and flour and candle and candlesticks and spoons and the old warming pan and most a thousand thing that i disremember now and my new calico dress and me and uncle_silas and my mars_sid and jim_tom_sawyer on the constant watch day and night as i was a telling you and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them and here at the last minute lo and behold you they slides right in under our noses and fools us and not only fools us but the injun territory robbers too and actuly gets away with that nigger safe and sound and
and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of ther ai that with sixteen man and twenty two dog right on their very heels at that very time
i tell you it just bangs anything i ever heard of why sperits couldnt a done better and been no smarter

you explain that to me if you can any of you well it does beat laws alive i never so help me i wouldnt a be house thieves as well as
why i was that scared i dasnt hardly go to bed or get up or lay down or set down sister ridgeway
why they steal the very why goodness sakes you can guess what kind of a fluster i was in by the time
goodnessgracioussakes i a ben afeard to live in sich a fraid to live midnight come last night i hope to gracious if i warnt afraid they steal some the family
it looks foolish enough now in the daytime but i says to myself there my two poor boy asleep way up stairs in that lonesome room and i declare to goodness
i was just to that pass i didnt have no reasoning faculties no more i was that uneasyt i crep up there and locked em in
because you know when you get scared that way and it keeps running on and getting worse and worse all the time and your wits gets to addling and you get to doing all sorts wild thing and by and by you think to yourself
i did and anybody would spos i was a boy and was away up there and the door aint locked and you
she stopped looking kind of wondering and then she turned her head around slow and when her eye lit on me i got up and took a walk
says i to myself i can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little
and when it was late in the day the people all went and then i come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and mars_sid and the door was locked and we wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightning rod and both of us got hurt a little and we didnt never want to try that no more
and then i went on and told her all what i told uncle_silas before and then she said she forgive us and maybe it was all right enough anyway and about what a body might expect of boy for all boy was a pretty harum scarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm hadnt come of it she judged she better put in her time being grateful
so i done it but i dasnt go fur or she a sent for me we was alive and well and she had us still
so then she kissed me and patted me on the head and dropped into a kind of a brown study and pretty soon jumps up and says why lawsamercy it most night and mars_sid not come yet
i see my chance so i skips up and says i ll run right up to town and get him i says
stead of fretting over what was past and done what has become of that boy no you wont she says
you ll stay right wher you are one enough to be lost at a time if he aint here to supper your uncle ll go
well he warnt there to supper so right after supper uncle went he come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadnt run across jim_tom_sawyer track
aunt_sally was a good deal uneasy but uncle_silas he said there warnt no occasion to be boy will be boy he said and you ll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right
but she said she set up for him a while anyway and keep a light burning so he could see it
and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle and tucked me in and mothered me so good
and like i couldnt look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time and said what a splendid boy
so she had to be satisfied i felt mean mars_sid was and didnt seem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me every now
and then if i reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybe drownded and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead and she not by him to help him and so the tears would drip down silent and i would tell her that mars_sid was all right and would be home in the morning sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss me and tell me to say it again and keep on saying it because it done her good and she was in so much trouble
and when she was going away she looked down in my eye so steady and gentle and says the door aint going to be locked jim_tom_sawyer and there the window and the rod but you ll be good wont you
laws knows i wanted to go bad enough to see about jim_tom_sawyer and was all intending to go but after that i wouldnt a went not for kingdoms
and you wont go for my sake but she was on my mind and jim_tom_sawyer was on my mind so i slept very restless
and twice i went down the rod away in the night and slipped around front and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eye towards the road and the tears in them and i wished i could do something for her but i couldnt only to swear that i wouldnt never do nothing to grieve her any more
and the third time i waked up at dawn and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most out and her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleep
the old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldnt get no track of jim_tom_sawyer and both of them set at the table thinking and not saying nothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and not eating anything
chapter xlii and by and by the old man says did i give you the letter what letter the one i got yesterday out of the post office
so he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down and fetched it and give it to her
no you didnt give me no letter well i must a forgot it she says why it from st petersburg it from sis
i allowed another walk would do me good but i couldnt stir but before she could break it open she dropped it and run for she see something
i it was jim_tom_sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and jim_tom_sawyer in her calico dress with his hand tied behind him and a lot of people
and so did i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy and rushed she flung herself at jim_tom_sawyer crying and says oh he dead he dead i know he dead
and jim_tom_sawyer he turned his head a little and muttered something or other which showed he warnt in his right mind then she flung up her hand and says he alive thank god
and she snatched a kiss of him and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering orders right and left at the nigger and everybody else as fast as her tongue could go every jump of the way
i followed the man to see what they was going to do with jim_tom_sawyer and the old doctor and uncle_silas followed after jim_tom_sawyer into the house
the man was very huffy and some of them wanted to hang jim_tom_sawyer for an example to all the other nigger around there so they wouldnt be trying to run away like jim_tom_sawyer done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping a whole family scared most to death for day and night
but the others said dont do it it wouldnt answer at all he aint our nigger and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him sure
so that cooled them down a little because the people that always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that haint done just right is always the very one that aint the most anxious to pay for him when they ve got their satisfaction out of him
they cussed jim_tom_sawyer considerble though and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while but jim_tom_sawyer never said nothing and he never let on to know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clothe on him and chained him again and not to no bed leg this time but to a big staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hand too and both leg and said he warnt to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come or he was sold at auction because he didnt come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole and said a couple of farmers with gun must stand watch around about the cabin every night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good bye cussing and then the old doctor comes and takes a look and says dont be no rougher on him than you re obleeged to because he aint a bad nigger
when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldnt cut the bullet out without some help and he warnt in no condition for me to leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a little worse and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldnt let me come a nigh him any more and said if i chalked his raft he kill me and no end of wild foolishness like that and i see i couldnt do anything at all with him
so i says i got to have help somehow and the minute i says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he ll help and he done it too and done it very well
and that enough of course i judged he must be a runaway nigger and there i was and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night
i had a couple of patients with the chills and of course i of liked to run up to town and see them but
i dasnt because the nigger might get away and then i be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail
so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this morning and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller and yet he was risking his freedom to do it and was all tired out too and i see plain enough he been worked main hard lately
i liked the nigger for that i tell you gentleman a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollar and kind treatment too
i had everything i needed and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home better maybe because it was so quiet but there i was with both of on my hand and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning
then some man in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep so i motioned them in quiet and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about and we never had no trouble
and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep too we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on and towed her over very nice and quiet and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start
it was a fix i tell you he aint no bad nigger gentleman that what i think about him somebody says well it sounds very good doctor i obleeged to say
then the others softened up a little too and i was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing jim_tom_sawyer that good turn and i was glad it was according to my judgment of him too because i thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him
then they all agreed that jim_tom_sawyer had acted very well and was deserving to have some notice took of it and reward
so every one of them promised right out and hearty that they wouldnt cuss him no more then they come out and locked him up
i hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off because they was rotten heavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but they didnt think of it and i reckoned it warnt best for me to mix in but i judged i get the doctor yarn to aunt_sally somehow or other as soon as i got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me explanations i mean of how i forgot to mention about mars_sid being shot when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger
aunt_sally she stuck to the sick room all day and all night and every time i see uncle_silas mooning around i dodged him
next morning i heard jim_tom_sawyer was a good deal better and they said aunt_sally was gone to get a nap
but i had plenty time so i slips to the sick room and if i found him awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash
but he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too and pale not fire faced the way he was when he come so i set down and laid for him to wake
she motioned me to be still and set down by me and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyful now because all the symptoms was first rate and he been sleeping like that for ever so long and looking better and peacefuller all the time and ten to one he wake up in his right mind
so we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened his eye very natural and takes a look and says hello why i at home
in about half an hour aunt_sally comes gliding in and there i was up a stump again how that where the raft
it all right i says and jim_tom_sawyer the same i says but couldnt say it pretty brash
but he never noticed but says good splendid now we re all right and safe did you tell aunty i was going to say yes but she chipped in and says about what mars_sid
why about the way the whole thing was done what whole thing why the whole thing there aint but one
how we set the runaway nigger free me and jim_tom_sawyer good land set the run what is the child talking about
dear dear out of his head again no i aint out of my head i know all what i talking about
we did set him free me and jim_tom_sawyer we laid out to do it and we done it and we done it elegant too
he got a start and she never checked him up just set and stared and stared and let him clip along and i see it warn t
no use for me to put in why aunty it cost us a power of work weeks of it hour and hour every night whilst you was all asleep
and we had to steal candle and the sheet and the shirt and your dress and spoons and tin plates and case knives and the warming pan and the grindstone and flour and just no end of thing and you cant think what work it was to make the saws and pens and inscriptions and one thing or another and you cant think half the fun it was
and we had to make up the pictures of coffins and thing and nonnamous letters from the robbers and get up and down the lightning rod and dig the hole into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie and send in spoons and thing to work with in your apron pocket
and load up the cabin with rat and snake and so on for company for jim_tom_sawyer and then you kept jim_tom_sawyer here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business because the man come before we was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and let drive at us and i got my share and we dodged out of the path and let them go by and when the dog come they warn t
interested in us but went for the most noise and we got our canoe and made for the raft and was all safe and jim_tom_sawyer was a free man and we done it all by ourselves and wasnt it bully aunty
so it was you you little rapscallions that been making all this trouble and turned everybody wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death
mercy sakes well i never heard the likes of it in all my born day i ve as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out
o you this very minute to think here i ve been night after night a you just get well once you young scamp and i lay i ll tan the old harry out
but jim_tom_sawyer he was so proud and joyful he just couldnt hold in and his tongue just went it she a chipping in and spitting fire all along and both of them going it at once like a cat convention and she says well you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now for mind
o both ye i tell you if i catch you meddling with him again meddling with who jim_tom_sawyer says dropping his smile and looking surprised
with who why the runaway nigger of course who you reckon jim_tom_sawyer looks at me very grave and says jim_tom_sawyer didnt you just tell me he was all right
they ve got him back safe and sound and he in that cabin again on bread and water and loaded down with chains till he claimed or sold
jim_tom_sawyer rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills and sings out to me
hasnt he got away him says aunt_sally the runaway nigger deed he hasnt they haint no right to shut him up
shove and dont you lose a minute turn him loose he aint no slave he as free as any cretur that walks this earth
what does the child mean i mean every word i say aunt_sally and if somebody dont go i ll go
old miss_watson died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river and said so and she set him free in her will
i ve knowed him all his life and so has jim_tom_sawyer there then what on earth did you want to set him free for seeing he was already free
well that is a question i must say and just like woman why i wanted the adventure of it and i a waded neck deep in blood to goodness alive aunt polly
if she warnt standing right there just inside the door looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie i wish i may never
aunt_sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her and cried over her and i found a good enough place for me under the bed for it was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me
and i peeped out and in a little while jim_tom_sawyer aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at jim_tom_sawyer over her spectacles kind of grinding him into the earth you know
and then she says yes you better turn r head away i would if i was you jim_tom_sawyer oh deary me says aunt_sally is he changed so
why that aint jim_tom_sawyer it mars_sid jim_tom_sawyer tom why where is jim_tom_sawyer he was here a minute ago you mean where huck_creeps huck_finn
i reckon i haint raised such a scamp as my jim_tom_sawyer all these year not to know him when i see him
that what you mean that would be a pretty howdy do come out from under that bed huck_creeps huck_finn so i done it
aunt_sally she was one of the mixed upest looking persons i ever see except one and that was uncle_silas when he come in and they told it all to him
it kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didnt know nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayer meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because the oldest man in the world couldnt a understood it
so jim_tom_sawyer aunt polly she told all about who i was and what and i had to up and tell how i was in such a tight place that when mrs phelps took me for jim_tom_sawyer she chipped in and says oh go on and call me aunt_sally i used to it now and taint no need to change that when aunt_sally took me for jim_tom_sawyer
and i knowed he wouldnt mind because it would be nuts for him being a mystery and he make an adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied
and so it turned out and he let on to be mars_sid and made thing as soft as he could for me
and his aunt polly she said jim_tom_sawyer was right about old miss_watson setting jim_tom_sawyer free in her will and so sure enough jim_tom_sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free
and i couldnt ever understand before until that minute and that talk how he could help a body set a nigger free with his bringing up
well aunt polly she said that when aunt_sally wrote to her that jim_tom_sawyer and mars_sid had come all right and safe she says to herself
but not feeling brash i had to stand it there warnt no other way look at that now i might have expected it letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him
so now i got to go and trapse all the way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what that creetur up to this time as long as i couldnt seem to get any answer out of you about it
why i never heard nothing from you says aunt_sally well i wonder why i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by mars_sid being here
well i never got em sis aunt polly she turns around slow and severe and says you jim_tom_sawyer well what
he says kind of pettish dont you what me you impudent thing hand out them letters what letters
them letters i be bound if i have to take a holt of you i ll they re in the trunk
there now and they re just the same as they was when i got them out of the office i haint looked into them i haint touched them
but i knowed they make trouble and i thought if you warnt in no hurry i well you do need skinning there aint no mistake about it
and i wrote another one to tell you i was coming and i pose he no it come yesterday i haint read it yet but it all right i ve got that one
i wanted to offer to bet two dollar she hadnt but i reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to
so i never said nothing chapter the last the first time i catched jim_tom_sawyer private i asked him what was his idea time of the evasion what
it was he planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before
and he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we got jim_tom_sawyer out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about his being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the nigger around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass band and then he would be a hero and so would we
we had jim_tom_sawyer out of the chains in no time and when aunt polly and uncle_silas and aunt_sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse jim_tom_sawyer they made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give him all he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do
and we had him up to the sick room and had a high talk and jim_tom_sawyer give jim_tom_sawyer forty dollar for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so good and jim_tom_sawyer was pleased most to death and busted out and says dah now huck_creeps what i tell you what
but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was i tell you up dah on george_jackson islan i tole you
i got a hairy breas en what de sign un it en i tole you i ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich agin en it come true en heah
she is dah now doan talk to me signs is signs mine i tell you en i knowed jis well at
and then jim_tom_sawyer he talked along and talked along and says le all three slide out of here one of these night and get an outfit and go for howling adventures amongst the injuns over in the territory for a couple of weeks or two and i says all right that suits me but i aint got no money for to buy the outfit and i reckon i couldnt get none from home because it likely pap been back before now and got it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up
i uz gwineter be rich agin as i a stannin heah dis minute no he haint jim_tom_sawyer says it all there yet six thousand dollar and more and your pap haint ever been back since
hadnt when i come away anyhow jim_tom_sawyer says kind of solemn he aint a comin back no mo huck_creeps i says why jim_tom_sawyer
but i kept at him so at last he says doan you member de house dat was float down de river en dey wuz
nemmine why huck_creeps but he aint comin back no mo a man in dah kivered up en i went in en unkivered him and didn let you come in
jim_tom_sawyer most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watch guard for a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there aint nothing more to write about and i am rotten glad of it because if i a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldnt a tackled it and aint a going to no more
well den you kin git yo money when you wants it kase dat wuz him but i reckon i got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest because aunt_sally
she going to adopt me and sivilize me and i cant stand it i been there before the end yours truly huck_creeps huck_finn
