I can not persuade myself , Anselmo my friend , that what thou hast said to me is not in jest ; if I thought that thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed thee to go so far ; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to thee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me , or I do not know thee ; but no , I know well thou art Anselmo , and thou knowest that I am

not those of that Anselmo who was my friend , nor are those that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the Lothario thou knowest . True friends will prove their friends and make use of them , as a poet has said , usque ad aras ; whereby he meant that they will not make use of their friendship in things that are contrary to God 's will . If this , then , was a heathen 's feeling about friendship , how much more should it be a Christian 's , who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the sake of any human friendship ? And if a friend should go so far as to put aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend , it should not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment , but in such as affect the friend 's life and honour . Now tell me , Anselmo , in which of these two art thou imperilled , that I should hazard myself to gratify thee , and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me ? Neither forsooth ; on the contrary , thou dost ask of me , so far as I understand , to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life , and to rob myself of them at the same time ; for if I take away thy honour it is plain I take away thy life , as a man without honour is worse than dead ; and being the instrument , as thou wilt have it so , of so much wrong to thee , shall not Listen to me , Anselmo my friend , and be not impatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching the object of thy desire , for there will be time enough left for thee to reply and for me to hear .

Lothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the undertaking to the end , though he perceived he was to come out of it wearied and vanquished . The next day he received the four thousand crowns , and with them four thousand perplexities , for he knew not what to say by way of a new falsehood ; but in the end he made up his mind to tell him that Camilla stood as firm against gifts and promises as against words , and that there was no use in taking any further trouble , for the time was all spent to no purpose . But chance , directing things in a different manner , so ordered it that Anselmo , having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions , shut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen through the keyhole to what passed between them , and perceived that for more than half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla , nor would utter a word though he were to be there for an age ; and he came to the conclusion that what his friend had told him about the replies of Camilla was all invention and falsehood , and to ascertain if it were so '' ","i":161644},{"w":"`` how ill dost thou meet thy obligations to me , and the great confidence I repose in thee !

If the news of my death should reach the ears of Camilla , let her know that I forgive her , for she was not bound to perform miracles , nor ought I to have required her to perform them ; and since I have been the author of my own dishonour , there is no reason why - So far Anselmo had written , and thus it was plain that at this point , before he could finish what he had to say , his life came to an end . The next day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives , who had already ascertained his misfortune , as well as the convent where Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on that inevitable journey , not on account of the tidings of his death , but because of those she received of her lover 's departure . Although she saw herself a widow , it is said she refused either to quit the convent or take the veil , until , not long afterwards , intelligence reached her that Lothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de Lautrec had been recently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova in the kingdom of Naples , whither her too late repentant lover had repaired .

I forgot to say that Chrysostom , who is dead , was a great man for writing verses , so much so that he made carols for Christmas Eve , and plays for Corpus Christi , which the young men of our village acted , and all said they were excellent . When the villagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd 's dress , they were lost in wonder , and could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change . About this time the father of our Chrysostom died , and he was left heir to a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land , no small number of cattle and sheep , and a large sum of money , of all of which the young man was left dissolute owner , and indeed he was deserving of it all , for he was a very good comrade , and kind-hearted , and a friend of worthy folk , and had a countenance like a benediction .

Don Quixote and Sancho obeyed him and went to where the show was already put up and uncovered , set all around with lighted wax tapers which made it look splendid and bright . When they came to it Master Pedro ensconced himself inside it , for it was he who had to work the puppets , and a boy , a servant of his , posted himself outside to act as showman and explain the mysteries of the exhibition , having a wand in his hand to point to the figures as they came out . And so , all who were in the inn being arranged in front of the show , some of them standing , and Don Quixote , Sancho , the page , and cousin , accommodated with the best places , the interpreter began to say what he will hear or see who reads or hears the next chapter .

In short , the puppet-show storm passed off , and all supped in peace and good fellowship at Don Quixote 's expense , for he was the height of generosity . Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds took his departure , and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page came to bid Don Quixote farewell , the former returning home , the latter resuming his journey , towards which , to help him , Don Quixote gave him twelve reals .

The words that I have addressed to her were borne away on the wind , my promises have been despised , my presents have been refused , such feigned tears as I shed have been turned into open ridicule . In short , as Camilla is the essence of all beauty , so is she the treasure-house where purity dwells , and gentleness and modesty Take back thy money , my friend ; here it is , and I have had no need to touch it , for the chastity of Camilla yields not to things so base as gifts or promises . Be content , Anselmo , and refrain from making further proof ; and as thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts and suspicions that are and may be entertained of women , seek not to plunge again into the deep ocean of new embarrassments , or with another pilot make trial of the goodness and strength of the bark that Heaven has granted thee for thy passage across the sea of this world ; but reckon thyself now safe in port , moor thyself with the anchor of sound reflection , and rest in peace until thou art called upon to pay that debt which no nobility on earth can escape paying . Anselmo was completely satisfied by the words of Lothario , and believed them as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle ; nevertheless he begged of him not to relinquish the undertaking , were it but for the sake of curiosity and amusement ; though thenceforward he need not make use of the same earnest endeavours as before ; all he wished him to do was to write some verses to her , praising her under the name of Chloris , for he himself would give her to understand that he was in love with a lady to whom he had given that name to enable him to sing her praises with the decorum due to her modesty ; and if Lothario were unwilling to take the trouble of writing the verses he would compose them himself . That will not be necessary , '' ","i":164271},{"w":"`` for the muses are not such enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course of the year . Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a pretended amour of mine ; as for the verses will make them , and if not as good as the subject deserves , they shall be at least the best I can produce . An agreement to this effect was made between the friends , the ill-advised one and the treacherous , and Anselmo returning to his house asked Camilla the question she already wondered he had not asked before -- what it was that had caused her to write the letter she had sent him . Camilla replied that it had seemed to her that Lothario looked at her somewhat more freely than when he had been at home ; but that now she was undeceived and believed it to have been only her own imagination , for Lothario now avoided seeing her , or being alone with her . Anselmo told her she might be quite easy on the score of that suspicion , for he knew that Lothario was in love with a damsel of rank in the city whom he celebrated under the name of Chloris , and that even if he were not , his fidelity and their great friendship left no room for fear . Had not Camilla , however , been informed beforehand by Lothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence , and that he himself had told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes to give utterance to the praises of Camilla herself , no doubt she would have fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy ; but being forewarned she received the startling news without uneasiness . The next day as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to recite something of what he had composed for his mistress Chloris ; for as Camilla did not know her , he might safely say what he liked . Even did she know her , '' ","i":164663},{"w":"`` but I do not think it as good as the first one , or , more correctly speaking , less bad ; but you can easily judge , for it is this . '' ","i":165372},{"w":"`` Lothario my friend , I must tell thee I have a sorrow in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready to burst ; and it will be a wonder if it does not ; for the audacity of Leonela has now reached such a pitch that every night she conceals a gallant of hers in this house and remains with him till morning , at the expense of my reputation ; inasmuch as it is open to anyone to question it who may see him quitting my house at such unseasonable hours ; but what distresses me is that I can not punish or chide her , for her privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent about hers , while I am dreading that some catastrophe will come of it . As Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device to delude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out was Leonela 's lover and not hers ; but when he saw how she wept and suffered , and begged him to help her , he became convinced of the truth , and the conviction completed his confusion and remorse ; however , he told Camilla not to distress herself , as he would take measures to put a stop to the insolence of Leonela . At the same time he told her what , driven by the fierce rage of jealousy , he had said to Anselmo , and how he had arranged to hide himself in the closet that he might there see plainly how little she preserved her fidelity to him ; and he entreated her pardon for this madness , and her advice as to how to repair it , and escape safely from the intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had involved him . Camilla was struck with alarm at hearing what Lothario said , and with much anger , and great good sense , she reproved him and rebuked his base design and the foolish and mischievous resolution he had made ; but as woman has by nature a nimbler wit than man for good and for evil , though it is apt to fail when she sets herself deliberately to reason , Camilla on the spur of the moment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable , and told Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should conceal himself in the place he mentioned , for she hoped from his concealment to obtain the means of their enjoying themselves for the future without any apprehension ; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely she charged him to be careful , as soon as Anselmo was concealed , to come to her when Leonela should call him , and to all she said to him to answer as he would have answered had he not known that Anselmo was listening . Lothario pressed her to explain her intention fully , so that he might with more certainty and precaution take care to do what he saw to be needful .

He now came to a road branching in four directions , and immediately he was reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to consider which road they should take . In imitation of them he halted for a while , and after having deeply considered it , he gave Rocinante his head , submitting his own will to that of his hack , who followed out his first intention , which was to make straight for his own stable .

To say this , to lift his sword , to shelter himself well behind his buckler , and to assail the Biscayan was the work of an instant , determined as he was to venture all upon a single blow . The Biscayan , seeing him come on in this way , was convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing , and resolved to follow his example , so he waited for him keeping well under cover of his cushion , being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his mule , which , dead tired and never meant for this kind of game , could not stir a step . On , then , as aforesaid , came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan , with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half , while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand , and under the protection of his cushion ; and all present stood trembling , waiting in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall , and the lady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain , that God might deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found themselves . But it spoils all , that at this point and crisis the author of the history leaves this battle impending , giving as excuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievements of Don Quixote than what has been already set forth . It is true the second author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion , or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight ; and this being his persuasion , he did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history , which , heaven favouring him , he did find in a way that shall be related in the Second Part . otherwise thou liest .

And though it is plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other natural functions , because , in fact , they were men like ourselves , it is plain too that , wandering as they did the most part of their lives through woods and wilds and without a cook , their most usual fare would be rustic viands such as those thou now offer me ; so that , friend Sancho , let not that distress thee which pleases me , and do not seek to make a new world or pervert knight-errantry .

Have not your worships , '' ","i":57388},{"w":"`` read the annals and histories of England , in which are recorded the famous deeds of King Arthur , whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus , with regard to whom it is an ancient tradition , and commonly received all over that kingdom of Great Britain , that this king did not die , but was changed by magic art into a raven , and that in process of time he is to return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre '' ","i":57500},{"w":"`` It seems to me , Senor Knight-errant , that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions in the world , and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not so austere . '' ","i":58018},{"w":"`` As austere it may perhaps be , '' ","i":58060},{"w":"`` but so necessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt . For , if the truth is to be told , the soldier who executes what his captain orders does no less than the captain himself who gives the order . My meaning , is , that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of the world , but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray for , defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords , not under shelter but in the open air , a target for the intolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter . And as the business of war and all that relates and belongs to it can not be conducted without exceeding great sweat , toil , and exertion , it follows that those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak . I do not mean to say , nor does it enter into my thoughts , that the knight-errant 's calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell ; I would merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one , a hungrier and thirstier , a wretcheder , raggeder , and lousier ; for there is no reason to doubt that the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their lives . And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be emperors , in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat ; and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages to help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition and disappointed in their hopes . '' ","i":58074},{"w":"`` Sir , '' ","i":58525},{"w":"`` that can not be on any account omitted , and the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise : for it is usual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant , who on engaging in any great feat of arms has his lady before him , should turn his eyes towards her softly and lovingly , as though with them entreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake , and even though no one hear him , he is bound to say certain words between his teeth , commending himself to her with all his heart , and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories . Nor is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending themselves to God , for there will be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task . '' ","i":58533},{"w":"`` I say it is impossible that there could be a knight-errant without a lady , because to such it is as natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars : most certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a knight-errant without an amour , and for the simple reason that without one he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard , and one who had gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood , not by the door , but over the wall like a thief and a robber . Thus are we God 's ministers on earth and the arms by which his justice is done therein . '' ","i":58924},{"w":"`` Sir , one solitary swallow does not make summer ; moreover , I know that knight was in secret very deeply in love ; besides which , that way of falling in love with all that took his fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control .

I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity ; for the arms those men carried , with which they pounded us , were nothing more than their stakes , and not one of them , so far as I remember , carried rapier , sword , or dagger .

True it is I am a gentleman of known house , of estate and property , and entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulct ; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king ; for I would have thee know , Sancho , that there are two kinds of lineages in the world ; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings and princes , whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down ; and others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords ; so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are , and the others are what they formerly were not . And I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous , with which the king , my father-in-law that is to be , ought to be satisfied ; and should he not be , the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier , she will take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father ; if not , then it comes to seizing her and carrying her off where I please ; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents .

In that same country there was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could desire ; such was the beauty of Luscinda , a damsel as noble and as rich as I , but of happier fortunes , and of less firmness than was due to so worthy a passion as mine . This Luscinda I loved , worshipped , and adored from my earliest and tenderest years , and she loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood . Our parents were aware of our feelings , and were not sorry to perceive them , for they saw clearly that as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us , a thing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families and wealth . We grew up , and with our growth grew the love between us , so that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety 's sake to refuse me admission to his house , in this perhaps imitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets , and this refusal but added love to love and flame to flame ; for though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it upon our pens , which can make known the heart 's secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues ; for many a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue . '' ","i":107011},{"w":"`` Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady Luscinda was fond of books of chivalry , no other laudation would have been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding , for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for such delightful reading been wanting ; so , as far as I am concerned , you need waste no more words in describing her beauty , worth , and intelligence ; for , on merely hearing what her taste was , I declare her to be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world ; and I wish your worship had , along with Amadis of Gaul , sent her the worthy Don Rugel of Greece , for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish Daraida and Garaya , and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel , and the admirable verses of his bucolics , sung and delivered by him with such sprightliness , wit , and ease ; but a time may come when this omission can be remedied , and to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my village , for there I can give you more than three hundred books which are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life ; -- though it occurs to me that I have not got one of them now , thanks to the spite of wicked and envious enchanters ; -- but pardon me for having broken the promise we made not to interrupt your discourse ; for when I hear chivalry or knights-errant mentioned , I can no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat , or those of the moon moisture ; pardon me , therefore , and proceed , for that is more to the purpose now .

'' ","i":111439},{"w":"`` for if thou dost return soon from the place where I mean to send thee , my penance will be soon over , and my glory will soon begin . But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in suspense , waiting to see what comes of my words , I would have thee know , Sancho , that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect knights-errant -- I am wrong to say he was one ; he stood alone , the first , the only one , the lord of all that were in the world in his time . A fig for Don Belianis , and for all who say he equalled him in any respect , for , my oath upon it , they are deceiving themselves ! I say , too , that when a painter desires to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters that he knows ; and the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and callings that serve to adorn a state ; thus must he who would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses , in whose person and labours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience ; as Virgil , too , shows us in the person of AEneas the virtue of a pious son and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain ; not representing or describing them as they were , but as they ought to be , so as to leave the example of their virtues to posterity . In the same way Amadis was the polestar , day-star , sun of valiant and devoted knights , whom all we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to imitate . This , then , being so , I consider , friend Sancho , that the knight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry . Now one of the instances in which this knight most conspicuously showed his prudence , worth , valour , endurance , fortitude , and love , was when he withdrew , rejected by the Lady Oriana , to do penance upon the Pena Pobre , changing his name into that of Beltenebros , a name assuredly significant and appropriate to the life which he had voluntarily adopted . So , as it is easier for me to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder , cutting off serpents ' heads , slaying dragons , routing armies , destroying fleets , and breaking enchantments , and as this place is so well suited for a similar purpose , I must not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently offers me its forelock . '' ","i":111581},{"w":"`` Have I not told thee , '' ","i":112100},{"w":"`` that I mean to imitate Amadis here , playing the victim of despair , the madman , the maniac , so as at the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland , when at the fountain he had evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herself with Medoro and through grief thereat went mad , and plucked up trees , troubled the waters of the clear springs , slew destroyed flocks , burned down huts , levelled houses , dragged mares after him , and perpetrated a hundred thousand other outrages worthy of everlasting renown and record ? And though I have no intention of imitating Roland , or Orlando , or Rotolando -LRB- for he went by all these names -RRB- , step by step in all the mad things he did , said , and thought , I will make a rough copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential ; but perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis , who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow , gained as much fame as the most famous . '' ","i":112112},{"w":"`` I declare , Sancho , '' ","i":113926},{"w":"`` it shall be as thou wilt , for thy plan does not seem to me a bad one , and three days hence thou wilt depart , for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what I do and say for her sake , that thou mayest be able to tell it .

Thou must know that a certain widow , fair , young , independent , and rich , and above all free and easy , fell in love with a sturdy strapping young lay-brother ; his superior came to know of it , and one day said to the worthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance , ' I am surprised , senora , and not without good reason , that a woman of such high standing , so fair , and so rich as you are , should have fallen in love with such a mean , low , stupid fellow as So-and-so , when in this house there are so many masters , graduates , and divinity students from among whom you might choose as if they were a lot of pears , saying this one I 'll take , that I wo n't take ; ' but she replied to him with great sprightliness and candour , ` My dear sir , you are very much mistaken , and your ideas are very old-fashioned , if you think that I have made a bad choice in So-and-so , fool as he seems ; because for all I want with him he knows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle . ' In the same way , Sancho , for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the most exalted princess on earth . It is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they give them , had any such mistresses . Thinkest thou that the Amarillises , the Phillises , the Sylvias , the Dianas , the Galateas , the Filidas , and all the rest of them , that the books , the ballads , the barber 's shops , the theatres are full of , were really and truly ladies of flesh and blood , and mistresses of those that glorify and have glorified them ? ; they only invent them for the most part to furnish a subject for their verses , and that they may pass for lovers , or for men valiant enough to be so ; and so it suffices me to think and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous ; and as to her pedigree it is very little matter , for no one will examine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her , and I , for my part , reckon her the most exalted princess in the world . For thou shouldst know , Sancho , if thou dost not know , that two things alone beyond all others are incentives to love , and these are great beauty and a good name , and these two things are to be found in Dulcinea in the highest degree , for in beauty no one equals her and in good name few approach her ; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell , I persuade myself that all I say is as I say , neither more nor less , and I picture her in my imagination as I would have her to be , as well in beauty as in condition ; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia come up to her , nor any other of the famous women of times past , Greek , Barbarian , or Latin ; and let each say what he will , for if in this I am taken to task by the ignorant , I shall not be censured by the critical .

And if it were not for this , knights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril , as they do at every turn . For a knight , maybe , is fighting in the mountains of Armenia with some dragon , or fierce serpent , or another knight , and gets the worst of the battle , and is at the point of death ; but when he least looks for it , there appears over against him on a cloud , or chariot of fire , another knight , a friend of his , who just before had been in England , and who takes his part , and delivers him from death ; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping very much to his satisfaction ; and yet from one place to the other will have been two or three thousand leagues . And all this is done by the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant knights ; so that , friend Sancho , I find no difficulty in believing that thou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such a short time , since , as I have said , some friendly sage must have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it .

Many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed between Don Quixote and Don Fernando ; but they were brought to an end by a traveller who at this moment entered the inn , and who seemed from his attire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors , for he was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with half-sleeves and without a collar ; his breeches were also of blue cloth , and his cap of the same colour , and he wore yellow buskins and had a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his breast . Behind him , mounted upon an ass , there came a woman dressed in Moorish fashion , with her face veiled and a scarf on her head , and wearing a little brocaded cap , and a mantle that covered her from her shoulders to her feet . The man was of a robust and well-proportioned frame , in age a little over forty , rather swarthy in complexion , with long moustaches and a full beard , and , in short , his appearance was such that if he had been well dressed he would have been taken for a person of quality and good birth . '' ","i":182866},{"w":"`` Verily , gentlemen , if we reflect upon it , great and marvellous are the things they see , who make profession of the order of knight-errantry . Say , what being is there in this world , who entering the gate of this castle at this moment , and seeing us as we are here , would suppose or imagine us to be what we are ? Who would say that this lady who is beside me was the great queen that we all know her to be , or that I am that Knight of the Rueful Countenance , trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of Fame ? Now , there can be no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all those that mankind has invented , and is the more deserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril . Away with those who assert that letters have the preeminence over arms ; I will tell them , whosoever they may be , that they know not what they say . For the reason which such persons commonly assign , and upon which they chiefly rest , is , that the labours of the mind are greater than those of the body , and that arms give employment to the body alone ; as if the calling were a porter 's trade , for which nothing more is required than sturdy strength ; or as if , in what we who profess them call arms , there were not included acts of vigour for the execution of which high intelligence is requisite ; or as if the soul of the warrior , when he has an army , or the defence of a city under his care , did not exert itself as much by mind as by body . Nay ; see whether by bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of the enemy , his plans , stratagems , or obstacles , or to ward off impending mischief ; for all these are the work of the mind , and in them the body has no share whatever . Since , therefore , arms have need of the mind , as much as letters , let us see now which of the two minds , that of the man of letters or that of the warrior , has most to do ; and this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain ; for that purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object . The end and goal of letters -- I am not speaking now of divine letters , the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven ; for with an end the end of which is to establish distributive justice , give to every man that which is his , and see and take care that good laws are observed : an end undoubtedly noble , lofty , and deserving of high praise , but not such as should be given to that sought by arms , which have for their end and object peace , the greatest boon that men can desire in this life . The first good news the world and mankind received was that which the angels announced on the night that was our day , when they sang in the air , ` Glory to God in the highest , and peace on earth to men of good-will ; ' and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and earth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any house , was to say , ` Peace be on this house ; ' and many other times he said to them , ` My peace I give unto you , my peace I leave you , peace be with you ; ' a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand : a jewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in heaven . '' ","i":184320},{"w":"`` As we began in the student 's case with poverty and its accompaniments , let us see now if the soldier is richer , and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no one poorer ; for he is dependent on his miserable pay , which comes late or never , or else on what he can plunder , seriously imperilling his life and conscience ; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great that a slashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt , and in the depth of winter he has to defend himself against the inclemency of the weather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his mouth , which I need not say , coming from an empty place , must come out cold , contrary to the laws of nature . To be sure he looks forward to the approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed that awaits him , which , unless by some fault of his , never sins by being over narrow , for he can easily measure out on the ground as he likes , and roll himself about in it to his heart 's content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from him . Then , after all this , suppose the day and hour for taking his degree in his calling to have come ; suppose the day of battle to have arrived , when they invest him with the doctor 's cap made of lint , to mend some bullet-hole , perhaps , that has gone through his temples , or left him with a crippled arm or leg . Or if this does not happen , and merciful Heaven watches over him and keeps him safe and sound , it may be he will be in the same poverty he was in before , and he must go through more engagements and more battles , and come victorious out of all before he betters himself ; but miracles of that sort are seldom seen . For tell me , sirs , if you have ever reflected upon it , by how much do those who have gained by war fall short of the number of those who have perished in it ? No doubt you will reply that there can be no comparison , that the dead can not be numbered , while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with three figures . All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters ; for by skirts , to say nothing of sleeves , they all find means of support ; so that though the soldier has more to endure , his reward is much less . But against all this it may be urged that it is easier to reward two thousand soldiers , for the former may be remunerated by giving them places , which must perforce be conferred upon men of their calling , while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very property of the master they serve ; but this impossibility only strengthens my argument . Putting this , however , aside , for it is a puzzling question for which it is difficult to find a solution , let us return to the superiority of arms over letters , a matter still undecided , so many are the arguments put forward on each side ; for besides those I have mentioned , letters say that without them arms can not maintain themselves , for war , too , has its laws and is governed by them , and laws belong to the domain of letters and men of letters . To this arms make answer that without them laws can not be maintained , for by arms states are defended , kingdoms preserved , cities protected , roads made safe , seas cleared of pirates ; and , in short , if it were not for them , states , kingdoms , monarchies , cities , ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and confusion which war brings with it , so long as it lasts and is free to make use of its privileges and powers .

I am a knight-errant , and not one of those whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in her record , but of those who , in defiance and in spite of envy itself , and all the magicians that Persia , or Brahmans that India , or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever produced , will place their names in the temple of immortality , to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come , whereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms . '' ","i":227555},{"w":"`` Haply , gentlemen , you are versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry ? '' ","i":227812},{"w":"`` To tell the truth , senor curate , I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State ; and though , led by idle and false taste , I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed , I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end ; for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing ; and one has nothing more in it than another ; this no more than that . And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of the same species as the fables they call the Milesian , nonsensical tales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction , exactly the opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the same time . And though it may be the chief object of such books to amuse , I do not know how they can succeed , when they are so full of such monstrous nonsense . For the enjoyment the mind feels must come from the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the things that the eye or the imagination brings before it ; and nothing that has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure . What beauty , then , or what proportion of the parts to the whole , or of the whole to the parts , can there be in a book or fable where a lad of sixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of him as if he was an almond cake ? And when they want to give us a picture of a battle , after having told us that there are a million of combatants on the side of the enemy , let the hero of the book be opposed to them , and we have perforce to believe , whether we like it or not , that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his strong arm . And then , what shall we say of the facility with which a born queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some unknown wandering knight ? What mind , that is not wholly barbarous and uncultured , can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of knights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind , and will be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of Prester John of the Indies , or some other that Ptolemy never described nor Marco Polo saw ? And if , in answer to this , I am told that the authors of books of the kind write them as fiction , and therefore are not bound to regard niceties of truth , I would reply that fiction is all the better the more it looks like truth , and gives the more pleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it . Plots in fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader , and be constructed in such a way that , reconciling impossibilities , smoothing over difficulties , keeping the mind on the alert , they may surprise , interest , divert , and entertain , so that wonder and delight joined may keep pace one with the other ; all which he will fail to effect who shuns verisimilitude and truth to nature , wherein lies the perfection of writing . I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in all its numbers , so that the middle agrees with the beginning , and the end with the beginning and middle ; on the contrary , they construct them with such a multitude of members that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or monster rather than a well-proportioned figure . And besides all this they are harsh in their style , incredible in their achievements , licentious in their amours , uncouth in their courtly speeches , prolix in their battles , silly in their arguments , absurd in their travels , and , in short , wanting in everything like intelligent art ; for which reason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a worthless breed . The curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of sound understanding , and that there was good reason in what he said ; so he told him that , being of the same opinion himself , and bearing a grudge to books of chivalry , he had burned all Don Quixote 's , which were many ; and gave him an account of the scrutiny he had made of them , and of those he had condemned to the flames and those he had spared , with which the canon was not a little amused , adding that though he had said so much in condemnation of these books , still he found one good thing in them , and that was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted intellect for displaying itself ; for they presented a wide and spacious field over which the pen might range freely , describing shipwrecks , tempests , combats , battles , portraying a valiant captain with all the qualifications requisite to make one , showing him sagacious in foreseeing the wiles of the enemy , eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his soldiers , ripe in counsel , rapid in resolve , as bold in biding his time as in pressing the attack ; now picturing some sad tragic incident , now some joyful and unexpected event ; here a beauteous lady , virtuous , wise , and modest ; there a Christian knight , brave and gentle ; here a lawless , barbarous braggart ; there a courteous prince , gallant and gracious ; setting forth the devotion and loyalty of vassals , the greatness and generosity of nobles .

The carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot , the freshness of which seemed to invite , not enchanted people like Don Quixote , but wide-awake , sensible folk like his squire , who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little ; for if they did not let him out , the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required .

The procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road ; the goatherd took his leave of the party ; the officers of the Brotherhood declined to go any farther , and the curate paid them what was due to them ; the canon begged the curate to let him know how Don Quixote did , whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it , and then begged leave to continue his journey ; in short , they all separated and went their ways , leaving to themselves the curate and the barber , Don Quixote , Sancho Panza , and the good Rocinante , who regarded everything with as great resignation as his master . The carter yoked his oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay , and at his usual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed , and at the end of six days they reached Don Quixote 's village , and entered it about the middle of the day , which it so happened was a Sunday , and the people were all in the plaza , through which Don Quixote 's cart passed . They all flocked to see what was in the cart , and when they recognised their townsman they were filled with amazement , and a boy ran off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart . It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised , how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those accursed books of chivalry ; all which was renewed when they saw Don Quixote coming in at the gate .

'' ","i":252382},{"w":"`` In the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations had placed there as being out of his mind . He was a graduate of Osuna in canon law ; but even if he had been of Salamanca , it was the opinion of most people that he would have been mad all the same . This graduate , after some years of confinement , took it into his head that he was sane and in his full senses , and under this impression wrote to the Archbishop , entreating him earnestly , and in very correct language , to have him released from the misery in which he was living ; for by God 's mercy he had now recovered his lost reason , though his relations , in order to enjoy his property , kept him there , and , in spite of the truth , would make him out to be mad until his dying day . The Archbishop , moved by repeated sensible , well-written letters , directed one of his chaplains to make inquiry of the madhouse as to the truth of the licentiate 's statements , and to have an interview with the madman himself , and , if it should appear that he was in his senses , to take him out and restore him to liberty . The chaplain did so , and the governor assured him that the man was still mad , and that though he often spoke like a highly intelligent person , he would in the end break out into nonsense that in quantity and quality counterbalanced all the sensible things he had said before , as might be easily tested by talking to him . The chaplain resolved to try the experiment , and obtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an hour or more , during the whole of which time he never uttered a word that was incoherent or absurd , but , on the contrary , spoke so rationally that the chaplain was compelled to believe him to be sane . Among other things , he said the governor was against him , not to lose the presents his relations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid intervals ; and that the worst foe he had in his misfortune was his large property ; for in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged and threw doubts upon the mercy our Lord had shown him in turning him from a brute beast into a man . In short , he spoke in such a way that he cast suspicion on the governor , and made his relations appear covetous and heartless , and himself so rational that the chaplain determined to take him away with him that the Archbishop might see him , and ascertain for himself the truth of the matter . Yielding to this conviction , the worthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes in which the licentiate had entered the house given to him . The governor again bade him beware of what he was doing , as the licentiate was beyond a doubt still mad ; but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain from taking him away . The governor , seeing that it was the order of the Archbishop , obeyed , and they dressed the licentiate in his own clothes , which were new and decent . He , as soon as he saw himself clothed like one in his senses , and divested of the appearance of a madman , entreated the chaplain to permit him in charity to go and take leave of his comrades the madmen . The chaplain said he would go with him to see what madmen there were in the house ; so they went upstairs , and with them some of those who were present . Approaching a cage in which there was a furious madman , though just at that moment calm and quiet , the licentiate said to him , ` Brother , think if you have any commands for me , for I am going home , as God has been pleased , in his infinite goodness and mercy , without any merit of mine , to restore me my reason . Have strong hope and trust in him , for as he has restored me to my original condition , so likewise he will restore you if you trust in him . I will take care to send you some good things to eat ; and be sure you eat them ; for I would have you know I am convinced , as one who has gone through it , that all this madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains full of wind . I am now cured and in my senses , for with God 's power nothing is impossible . Take courage ! take courage ! for despondency in misfortune breaks down health and brings on death . ' To all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite that of the furious one was listening ; and raising himself up from an old mat on which he lay stark naked , he asked in a loud voice who it was that was going away cured and in his senses . The licentiate answered , ` It is I , brother , who am going ; I have now no need to remain here any longer , for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has had so great mercy upon me . ' '' ","i":252766},{"w":"`` which came in so pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it ? Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit , valour with valour , beauty with beauty , birth with birth , are always odious and unwelcome ?

My only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it makes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order of knight-errantry was in the field . But our depraved age does not deserve to enjoy such a blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant took upon their shoulders the defence of kingdoms , the protection of damsels , the succour of orphans and minors , the chastisement of the proud , and the recompense of the humble . With the knights of these days , for the most part , it is the damask , brocade , and rich stuffs they wear , that rustle as they go , not the chain mail of their armour ; no knight now-a-days sleeps in the open field exposed to the inclemency of heaven , and in full panoply from head to foot ; no one now takes a nap , as they call it , without drawing his feet out of the stirrups , and leaning upon his lance , as the knights-errant used to do ; no one now , issuing from the wood , penetrates yonder mountains , and then treads the barren , lonely shore of the sea -- mostly a tempestuous and stormy one -- and finding on the beach a little bark without oars , sail , mast , or tackling of any kind , in the intrepidity of his heart flings himself into it and commits himself to the wrathful billows of the deep sea , that one moment lift him up to heaven and the next plunge him into the depths ; and opposing his breast to the irresistible gale , finds himself , when he least expects it , three thousand leagues and more away from the place where he embarked ; and leaping ashore in a remote and unknown land has adventures that deserve to be written , not on parchment , but on brass . But now sloth triumphs over energy , indolence over exertion , vice over virtue , arrogance over courage , and theory over practice in arms , which flourished and shone only in the golden ages and in knights-errant .

Likewise , in the island of Sicily , there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so large that their size makes it plain that their owners were giants , and as tall as great towers ; geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt . But , for all that , I can not speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante , though I suspect he can not have been very tall ; and I am inclined to be of this opinion because I find in the history in which his deeds are particularly mentioned , that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses to contain him , it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything excessive .

What do the common people think of me ? What do the hidalgos ? What do the caballeros ? What do they say of my valour ; of my achievements ; of my courtesy ? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and restoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry ? In short , Sancho , I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on this subject ; and thou art to tell me , without adding anything to the good or taking away anything from the bad ; for it is the duty of loyal vassals to tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its proper shape , not allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it .

'' ","i":268203},{"w":"`` Recollect , my friend , '' ","i":268270},{"w":"`` all knights can not be courtiers , nor can all courtiers be knights-errant , nor need they be . There must be all sorts in the world ; and though we may be all knights , there is a great difference between one and another ; for the courtiers , without quitting their chambers , or the threshold of the court , range the world over by looking at a map , without its costing them a farthing , and without suffering heat or cold , hunger or thirst ; but we , the true knights-errant , measure the whole earth with our own feet , exposed to the sun , to the cold , to the air , to the inclemencies of heaven , by day and night , on foot and on horseback ; nor do we only know enemies in pictures , but in their own real shapes ; and at all risks and on all occasions we attack them , without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat , whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword , whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him , whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out , and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man , that you know nothing about , but I do . And you must know besides , that the true knight-errant , though he may see ten giants , that not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them , and that go , each of them , on two tall towers by way of legs , and whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships , and each eye like a great mill-wheel , and glowing brighter than a glass furnace , must not on any account be dismayed by them . On the contrary , he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart , and , if possible , vanquish and destroy them , even though they have for armour the shells of a certain fish , that they say are harder than diamonds , and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of Damascus steel , or clubs studded with spikes also of steel , such as I have more than once seen . All this I say , housekeeper , that you may see the difference there is between the one sort of knight and the other ; and it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on this second , or more properly speaking first , kind of knights-errant ; for , as we read in their histories , there have been some among them who have been the salvation , not merely of one kingdom , but of many . '' ","i":268281},{"w":"`` By the God that gives me life , '' ","i":268846},{"w":"`` if thou wert not my full niece , being daughter of my own sister , I would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with . can it be that a young hussy that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongue and criticise the histories of knights-errant ? He , however , no doubt would forgive thee , for he was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his time , and moreover a great protector of damsels ; but some there are that might have heard thee , and it would not have been well for thee in that case ; for they are not all courteous or mannerly ; some are ill-conditioned scoundrels ; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman , that is so in all respects ; some are gold , others pinchbeck , and all look like gentlemen , but not all can stand the touchstone of truth . There are men of low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen , and high gentlemen who , one would fancy , were dying to pass for men of low rank ; the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues , the latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by their vices ; and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen , so much alike in name and so different in conduct . '' ","i":268860},{"w":"`` and I could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish you ; but , not to mix up things human and divine , I refrain . Look you , my dears , all the lineages in the world -LRB- attend to what I am saying -RRB- can be reduced to four sorts , which are these : those that had humble beginnings , and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained surpassing greatness ; those that had great beginnings and maintained them , and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin ; those , again , that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid , having reduced and lessened their original greatness till it has come to nought , like the point of a pyramid , which , relatively to its base or foundation , is nothing ; and then there are those -- and it is they that are the most numerous -- that have had neither an illustrious beginning nor a remarkable mid-course , and so will have an end without a name , like an ordinary plebeian line . Of the first , those that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve , the Ottoman house may serve as an example , which from an humble and lowly shepherd , its founder , has reached the height at which we now see it . For examples of the second sort of lineage , that began with greatness and maintains it still without adding to it , there are the many princes who have inherited the dignity , and maintain themselves in their inheritance , without increasing or diminishing it , keeping peacefully within the limits of their states . Of those that began great and ended in a point , there are thousands of examples , for all the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt , the Caesars of Rome , and the whole herd -LRB- if I may apply such a word to them -RRB- of countless princes , monarchs , lords , Medes , Assyrians , Persians , Greeks , and barbarians , all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to nothing , they themselves as well as their founders , for it would be impossible now to find one of their descendants , and , even should we find one , it would be in some lowly and humble condition . Of plebeian lineages I have nothing to say , save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live , without any eminence to entitle them to any fame or praise beyond this . From all I have said I would have you gather , my poor innocents , that great is the confusion among lineages , and that only those are seen to be great and illustrious that show themselves so by the virtue , wealth , and generosity of their possessors . I have said virtue , wealth , and generosity , because a great man who is vicious will be a great example of vice , and a rich man who is not generous will be merely a miserly beggar ; for the possessor of wealth is not made happy by possessing it , but by spending it , and not by spending as he pleases , but by knowing how to spend it well . The poor gentleman has no way of showing that he is a gentleman but by virtue , by being affable , well-bred , courteous , gentle-mannered , and kindly , not haughty , arrogant , or censorious , but above all by being charitable ; for by two maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the poor , he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms with bell-ringing , and no one that perceives him to be endowed with the virtues I have named , even though he know him not , will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood ; and it would be strange were it not so ; praise has ever been the reward of virtue , and those who are virtuous can not fail to receive commendation . There are two roads , my daughters , by which men may reach wealth and honours ; one is that of letters , the other that of arms . I have more of arms than of letters in my composition , and , judging by my inclination to arms , was born under the influence of the planet Mars . I am , therefore , in a measure constrained to follow that road , and by it I must travel in spite of all the world , and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills , fate ordains , reason requires , and , above all , my own inclination favours ; for knowing as I do the countless toils that are the accompaniments of knight-errantry , I know , too , the infinite blessings that are attained by it ; I know that the path of virtue is very narrow , and the road of vice broad and spacious ; I know their ends and goals are different , for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death , and the narrow and toilsome one of virtue in life , and not transitory life , but in that which has no end ; I know , as our great Castilian poet says , that -- '' ","i":269259},{"w":"`` I can tell you , niece , '' ","i":270300},{"w":"`` if these chivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties , there would be nothing that I could not do , nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my hands , particularly cages and tooth-picks .

The instant the housekeeper knew who it was , she ran to hide herself so as not to see him ; in such abhorrence did she hold him . The niece let him in , and his master Don Quixote came forward to receive him with open arms , and the pair shut themselves up in his room , where they had another conversation not inferior to the previous one . The instant the housekeeper saw Sancho Panza shut himself in with her master , she guessed what they were about ; and suspecting that the result of the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a third sally , she seized her mantle , and in deep anxiety and distress , ran to find the bachelor Samson Carrasco , as she thought that , being a well-spoken man , and a new friend of her master 's , he might be able to persuade him to give up any such crazy notion .

'' ","i":274596},{"w":"`` reminds me of what happened to a famous poet of our own day , who , having written a bitter satire against all the courtesan ladies , did not insert or name in it a certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she was one or not . She , seeing she was not in the list of the poet , asked him what he had seen in her that he did not include her in the number of the others , telling him he must add to his satire and put her in the new part , or else look out for the consequences . The poet did as she bade him , and left her without a shred of reputation , and she was satisfied by getting fame though it was infamy . In keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd who set fire to the famous temple of Diana , by repute one of the seven wonders of the world , and burned it with the sole object of making his name live in after ages ; and , though it was forbidden to name him , or mention his name by word of mouth or in writing , lest the object of his ambition should be attained , nevertheless it became known that he was called Erostratus . And something of the same sort is what happened in the case of the great emperor Charles V and a gentleman in Rome . The emperor was anxious to see that famous temple of the Rotunda , called in ancient times the temple ` of all the gods , ' but now-a-days , by a better nomenclature , ` of all the saints , ' which is the best preserved building of all those of pagan construction in Rome , and the one which best sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its founders . It is in the form of a half orange , of enormous dimensions , and well lighted , though no light penetrates it save that which is admitted by a window , or rather round skylight , at the top ; and it was from this that the emperor examined the building . A Roman gentleman stood by his side and explained to him the skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful architecture , and when they had left the skylight he said to the emperor , ' A thousand times , your Sacred Majesty , the impulse came upon me to seize your Majesty in my arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight , so as to leave behind me in the world a name that would last for ever . ' ' I am thankful to you for not carrying such an evil thought into effect , ' said the emperor , ` and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again putting your loyalty to the test ; and I therefore forbid you ever to speak to me or to be where I am ; and he followed up these words by bestowing a liberal bounty upon him .

The queen Artemisia buried her husband Mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world ; but none of these tombs , or of the many others of the heathens , were ornamented with winding-sheets or any of those other offerings and tokens that show that they who are buried there are saints .

While the two were engaged in this conversation , they perceived some one with a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood , and from the noise the plough made , as it dragged along the ground , they guessed him to be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his work , and so it proved to be .

I call her peerless because she has no peer , whether it be in bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty . This same Casildea , then , that I speak of , requited my honourable passion and gentle aspirations by compelling me , as his stepmother did Hercules , to engage in many perils of various sorts , at the end of each promising me that , with the end of the next , the object of my hopes should be attained ; but my labours have gone on increasing link by link until they are past counting , nor do I know what will be the last one that is to be the beginning of the accomplishment of my chaste desires . On one occasion she bade me go and challenge the famous giantess of Seville , La Giralda by name , who is as mighty and strong as if made of brass , and though never stirring from one spot , is the most restless and changeable woman in the world . , I saw , I conquered , and I made her stay quiet and behave herself , for nothing but north winds blew for more than a week . Another time I was ordered to lift those ancient stones , the mighty bulls of Guisando , an enterprise that might more fitly be entrusted to porters than to knights . Again , she bade me fling myself into the cavern of Cabra -- an unparalleled and awful peril -- and bring her a minute account of all that is concealed in those gloomy depths . I stopped the motion of the Giralda , I lifted the bulls of Guisando , I flung myself into the cavern and brought to light the secrets of its abyss ; and my hopes are as dead as dead can be , and her scorn and her commands as lively as ever . To be brief , last of all she has commanded me to go through all the provinces of Spain and compel all the knights-errant wandering therein to confess that she surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty , and that I am the most valiant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth ; in support of which claim I have already travelled over the greater part of Spain , and have there vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me ; but what I most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combat that so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha , and made him confess that my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea ; and in this one victory I hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world ; for this Don Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all , and I having vanquished him , his glory , his fame , and his honour have passed and are transferred to my person ; for The more the vanquished hath of fair renown , The greater glory gilds the victor 's crown .

And to prove it , thou knowest already , Sancho , by experience which can not lie or deceive , how easy it is for enchanters to change one countenance into another , turning fair into foul , and foul into fair ; for it is not two days since thou sawest with thine own eyes the beauty and elegance of the peerless Dulcinea in all its perfection and natural harmony , while I saw her in the repulsive and mean form of a coarse country wench , with cataracts in her eyes and a foul smell in her mouth ; and when the perverse enchanter ventured to effect so wicked a transformation , it is no wonder if he effected that of Samson Carrasco and thy gossip in order to snatch the glory of victory out of my grasp . For all that , however , I console myself , because , after all , in whatever shape he may have been , I have victorious over my enemy .

I have left my home , I have mortgaged my estate , I have given up my comforts , and committed myself to the arms of Fortune , to bear me whithersoever she may please . My desire was to bring to life again knight-errantry , now dead , and for some time past , stumbling here , falling there , now coming down headlong , now raising myself up again , I have carried out a great portion of my design , succouring widows , protecting maidens , and giving aid to wives , orphans , and minors , the proper and natural duty of knights-errant ; and , therefore , because of my many valiant and Christian achievements , I have been already found worthy to make my way in print to well-nigh all , or most , of the nations of the earth . Thirty thousand volumes of my history have been printed , and it is on the high-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times , if heaven does not put a stop to it . In short , to sum up all in a few words , or in a single one , I may tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha , otherwise called ` The Knight of the Rueful Countenance ; ' for though self-praise is degrading , I must perforce sound my own sometimes , that is to say , when there is no one at hand to do it for me . So that , gentle sir , neither this horse , nor this lance , nor this shield , nor this squire , nor all these arms put together , nor the sallowness of my countenance , nor my gaunt leanness , will henceforth astonish you , now that you know who I am and what profession I follow . The trappings of the mare were of the field and jineta fashion , and of mulberry colour and green . '' ","i":299752},{"w":"`` as to whether the histories of the knights-errant are fiction or not . I doubt it , '' ","i":300417},{"w":"`` but never mind that just now ; if our journey lasts long enough , I trust in God I shall show your worship that you do wrong in going with the stream of those who regard it as a matter of certainty that they are not true . '' ","i":300440},{"w":"`` Children , senor , are portions of their parents ' bowels , and therefore , be they good or bad , are to be loved as we love the souls that give us life ; it is for the parents to guide them from infancy in the ways of virtue , propriety , and worthy Christian conduct , so that when grown up they may be the staff of their parents ' old age , and the glory of their posterity ; and to force them to study this or that science I do not think wise , though it may be no harm to persuade them ; and when there is no need to study for the sake of pane lucrando , and it is the student 's good fortune that heaven has given him parents who provide him with it , it would be my advice to them to let him pursue whatever science they may see him most inclined to ; and though that of poetry is less useful than pleasurable , it is not one of those that bring discredit upon the possessor . Poetry , gentle sir , is , as I take it , like a tender young maiden of supreme beauty , to array , bedeck , and adorn whom is the task of several other maidens , who are all the rest of the sciences ; and she must avail herself of the help of all , and all derive their lustre from her . But this maiden will not bear to be handled , nor dragged through the streets , nor exposed either at the corners of the market-places , or in the closets of palaces . She is the product of an Alchemy of such virtue that he who is able to practise it , will turn her into pure gold of inestimable worth . He that possesses her must keep her within bounds , not permitting her to break out in ribald satires or soulless sonnets . She must on no account be offered for sale , unless , indeed , it be in heroic poems , moving tragedies , or sprightly and ingenious comedies . She must not be touched by the buffoons , nor by the ignorant vulgar , incapable of comprehending or appreciating her hidden treasures . And do not suppose , senor , that I apply the term vulgar here merely to plebeians and the lower orders ; for everyone who is ignorant , be he lord or prince , may and should be included among the vulgar . He , then , who shall embrace and cultivate poetry under the conditions I have named , shall become famous , and his name honoured throughout all the civilised nations of the earth . And with regard to what you say , senor , of your son having no great opinion of Spanish poetry , I am inclined to think that he is not quite right there , and for this reason : the great poet Homer did not write in Latin , because he was a Greek , nor did Virgil write in Greek , because he was a Latin ; in short , all the ancient poets wrote in the language they imbibed with their mother 's milk , and never went in quest of foreign ones to express their sublime conceptions ; and that being so , the usage should in justice extend to all nations , and the German poet should not be undervalued because he writes in his own language , nor the Castilian , nor even the Biscayan , for writing in his . But your son , senor , I suspect , is not prejudiced against Spanish poetry , but against those poets who are mere Spanish verse writers , without any knowledge of other languages or sciences to adorn and give life and vigour to their natural inspiration ; and yet even in this he may be wrong ; for , according to a true belief , a poet is born one ; that is to say , the poet by nature comes forth a poet from his mother 's womb ; and following the bent that heaven has bestowed upon him , without the aid of study or art , he produces things that show how truly he spoke who said , ` Est Deus in nobis , ' etc. . At the same time , I say that the poet by nature who calls in art to his aid will be a far better poet , and will surpass him who tries to be one relying upon his knowledge of art alone . The reason is , that art does not surpass nature , but only brings it to perfection ; and thus , nature combined with art , and art with nature , will produce a perfect poet . To bring my argument to a close , I would say then , gentle sir , let your son go on as his star leads him , for being so studious as he seems to be , and having already successfully surmounted the first step of the sciences , which is that of the languages , with their help he will by his own exertions reach the summit of polite literature , which so well becomes an independent gentleman , and adorns , honours , and distinguishes him , as much as the mitre does the bishop , or the gown the learned counsellor . If your son write satires reflecting on the honour of others , chide and correct him , and tear them up ; but if he compose discourses in which he rebukes vice in general , in the style of Horace , and with elegance like his , commend him ; for it is legitimate for a poet to write against envy and lash the envious in his verse , and the other vices too , provided he does not single out individuals ; there are , however , poets who , for the sake of saying something spiteful , would run the risk of being banished to the coast of Pontus . If the poet be pure in his morals , he will be pure in his verses too ; the pen is the tongue of the mind , and as the thought engendered there , so will be the things that it writes down . And when kings and princes observe this marvellous science of poetry in wise , virtuous , and thoughtful subjects , they honour , value , exalt them , and even crown them with the leaves of that tree which the thunderbolt strikes not , as if to show that they whose brows are honoured and adorned with such a crown are not to be assailed by anyone . He of the green gaban was filled with astonishment at Don Quixote 's argument , so much so that he began to abandon the notion he had taken up about his being crazy . But in the middle of the discourse , it being not very much to his taste , Sancho had turned aside out of the road to beg a little milk from some shepherds , who were milking their ewes hard by ; and just as the gentleman , highly pleased , was about to renew the conversation , Don Quixote , raising his head , perceived a cart covered with royal flags coming along the road they were travelling ; and persuaded that this must be some new adventure , he called aloud to Sancho to come and bring him his helmet . Sancho , hearing himself called , quitted the shepherds , and , prodding Dapple vigorously , came up to his master , to whom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure .

'' ","i":303641},{"w":"`` May be so , '' ","i":303703},{"w":"`` Lion-whelps to me ! to me whelps of lions , and at such a time ! Then , by God ! those gentlemen who send them here shall see if I am a man to be frightened by lions . Get down , my good fellow , and as you are the keeper open the cages , and turn me out those beasts , and in the midst of this plain I will let them know who Don Quixote of La Mancha is , in spite and in the teeth of the enchanters who send them to me .

Hearing this , Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an enterprise compared with which the one of the windmills , and the awful one of the fulling mills , and , in fact , all the feats he had attempted in the whole course of his life , were cakes and fancy bread .

The enchanters may be able to rob me of good fortune , but of fortitude and courage they can not . '' ","i":306487},{"w":"`` No doubt , Senor Don Diego de Miranda , you set me down in your mind as a fool and a madman , and it would be no wonder if you did , for my deeds do not argue anything else . But for all that , I would have you take notice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must have seemed to you . A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lance to bear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign , in the midst of a spacious plaza ; a knight shows to advantage arrayed in glittering armour , pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyous tournament , and all those knights show to advantage that entertain , divert , and , if we may say so , honour the courts of their princes by warlike exercises , or what resemble them ; but to greater advantage than all these does a knight-errant show when he traverses deserts , solitudes , cross-roads , forests , and mountains , in quest of perilous adventures , bent on bringing them to a happy and successful issue , all to win a glorious and lasting renown . To greater advantage , I maintain , does the knight-errant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonely waste , than the court knight dallying with some city damsel . All knights have their own special parts to play ; let the courtier devote himself to the ladies , let him add lustre to his sovereign 's court by his liveries , let him entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare of his table , let him arrange joustings , marshal tournaments , and prove himself noble , generous , and magnificent , and above all a good Christian , and so doing he will fulfil the duties that are especially his ; but let the knight-errant explore the corners of the earth and penetrate the most intricate labyrinths , at each step let him attempt impossibilities , on desolate heaths let him endure the burning rays of the midsummer sun , and the bitter inclemency of the winter winds and frosts ; let no lions daunt him , no monsters terrify him , no dragons make him quail ; for to seek these , to attack those , and to vanquish all , are in truth his main duties . I , then , as it has fallen to my lot to be a member of knight-errantry , can not avoid attempting all that to me seems to come within the sphere of my duties ; thus it was my bounden duty to attack those lions that I just now attacked , although I knew it to be the height of rashness ; for I know well what valour is , that it is a virtue that occupies a place between two vicious extremes , cowardice and temerity ; but it will be a lesser evil for him who is valiant to rise till he reaches the point of rashness , than to sink until he reaches the point of cowardice ; for , as it is easier for the prodigal than for the miser to become generous , so it is easier for a rash man to prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true valour ; and believe me , Senor Don Diego , in attempting adventures it is better to lose by a card too many than by a card too few ; for to hear it said , ` such a knight is rash and daring , ' sounds better than ` such a knight is timid and cowardly .

He must be a physician , and above all a herbalist , so as in wastes and solitudes to know the herbs that have the property of healing wounds , for a knight-errant must not go looking for some one to cure him at every step . He must be an astronomer , so as to know by the stars how many hours of the night have passed , and what clime and quarter of the world he is in . He must know mathematics , for at every turn some occasion for them will present itself to him ; and , putting it aside that he must be adorned with all the virtues , cardinal and theological , to come down to minor particulars , he must , I say , be able to swim as well as Nicholas or Nicolao the Fish could , as the story goes ; he must know how to shoe a horse , and repair his saddle and bridle ; and , to return to higher matters , he must be faithful to God and to his lady ; he must be pure in thought , decorous in words , generous in works , valiant in deeds , patient in suffering , compassionate towards the needy , and , lastly , an upholder of the truth though its defence should cost him his life . Of all these qualities , great and small , is a true knight-errant made up ; judge then , Senor Don Lorenzo , whether it be a contemptible science which the knight who studies and professes it has to learn , and whether it may not compare with the very loftiest that are taught in the schools .

Some days ago I became acquainted with your misfortune and the cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revenge yourselves upon your enemies ; and having many times thought over your business in my mind , I find that , according to the laws of combat , you are mistaken in holding yourselves insulted ; for a private individual can not insult an entire community ; unless it be by defying it collectively as a traitor , because he can not tell who in particular is guilty of the treason for which he defies it . Of this we have an example in Don Diego Ordonez de Lara , who defied the whole town of Zamora , because he did not know that Vellido Dolfos alone had committed the treachery of slaying his king ; and therefore he defied them all , and the vengeance and the reply concerned all ; though , to be sure , Senor Don Diego went rather too far , indeed very much beyond the limits of a defiance ; for he had no occasion to defy the dead , or the waters , or the fishes , or those yet unborn , and all the rest of it as set forth ; but let that pass , for when anger breaks out there 's no father , governor , or bridle to check the tongue . The case being , then , that no one person can insult a kingdom , province , city , state , or entire community , it is clear there is no reason for going out to avenge the defiance of such an insult , inasmuch as it is not one . A fine thing it would be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheads every moment with everyone who called them by that name , -- or the Cazoleros , Berengeneros , Ballenatos , Jaboneros , or the bearers of all the other names and titles that are always in the mouth of the boys and common people ! It would be a nice business indeed if all these illustrious cities were to take huff and revenge themselves and go about perpetually making trombones of their swords in every petty quarrel !

Sancho was by this time mounted with the help of Don Quixote , who then himself mounted Rocinante , and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to take shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off . Every now and then Sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans , and on Don Quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering , he replied that , from the end of his back-bone up to the nape of his neck , he was so sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses . The cause of that soreness , '' ","i":344931},{"w":"`` I would lay a good wager with you , Sancho , '' ","i":345628},{"w":"`` I own , Sancho , '' ","i":345999},{"w":"`` that all thou sayest is true ; how much , thinkest thou , ought I to give thee over and above what Tom Carrasco gave thee ?

When a knight is involved in some difficulty from which he can not be delivered save by the hand of another knight , though they may be at a distance of two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other , they either take him up on a cloud , or they provide a bark for him to get into , and in less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him where they will and where his help is required ; and so , Sancho , this bark is placed here for the same purpose ; this is as true as that it is now day , and ere this one passes tie Dapple and Rocinante together , and then in God 's hand be it to guide us ; for I would not hold back from embarking , though barefooted friars were to beg me .

Don Quixote had hardly said this , when the chamber door flew open with a loud bang , and with the start the noise gave her Dona Rodriguez let the candle fall from her hand , and the room was left as dark as a wolf 's mouth , as the saying is .

The battle lasted nearly half an hour , and then the phantoms fled ; Dona Rodriguez gathered up her skirts , and bemoaning her fate went out without saying a word to Don Quixote , and he , sorely pinched , puzzled , and dejected , remained alone , and there we will leave him , wondering who could have been the perverse enchanter who had reduced him to such a state ; but that shall be told in due season , for Sancho claims our attention , and the methodical arrangement of the story demands it .

And then plucking off a glove he threw it down in the middle of the hall , and the duke picked it up , saying , as he had said before , that he accepted the challenge in the name of his vassal , and fixed six days thence as the time , the courtyard of the castle as the place , and for arms the customary ones of knights , lance and shield and full armour , with all the other accessories , without trickery , guile , or charms of any sort , and examined and passed by the judges of the field .

Thus , God is superior to all because he is the supreme giver , and the offerings of man fall short by an infinite distance of being a full return for the gifts of God ; but gratitude in some degree makes up for this deficiency and shortcoming .

They then went on , and upon the green at the entrance of the town they came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with their breviaries . It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown , by way of a sumpter-cloth , over Dapple and over the bundle of armour , the buckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him at the duke 's castle the night Altisidora came back to life . He had also fixed the mitre on Dapple 's head , the oddest transformation and decoration that ever ass in the world underwent .

HOW HE DIED As nothing that is man 's can last for ever , but all tends ever downwards from its beginning to its end , and above all man 's life , and as Don Quixote 's enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to stay its course , its end and close came when he least looked for it . For whether it was of the dejection the thought of his defeat produced , or of heaven 's will that so ordered it -- a fever settled upon him and kept him in his bed for six days , during which he was often visited by his friends the curate , the bachelor , and the barber , while his good squire Sancho Panza never quitted his bedside . They , persuaded that it was grief at finding himself vanquished , and the object of his heart , the liberation and disenchantment of Dulcinea , unattained , that kept him in this state , strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up ; the bachelor bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life , for which he himself , he said , had already composed an eclogue that would take the shine out of all Sannazaro had ever written , and had bought with his own money two famous dogs to guard the flock , one called Barcino and the other Butron , which a herdsman of Quintanar had sold him .

' And those that are most given to reading it are the pages , for there is not a lord 's ante-chamber where there is not a ` Don Quixote ' to be found ; one takes it up if another lays it down ; this one pounces upon it , and that begs for it .

'' ","i":261047},{"w":"`` The reason of that , '' ","i":261550},{"w":"`` is , that as printed works are examined leisurely , their faults are easily seen ; and the greater the fame of the writer , the more closely are they scrutinised .

'' ","i":261560},{"w":"`` but I wish such fault-finders were more lenient and less exacting , and did not pay so much attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble at ; for if aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus , they should remember how long he remained awake to shed the light of his work with as little shade as possible ; and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with may be moles , that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears them ; and so I say very great is the risk to which he who prints a book exposes himself , for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write one that will satisfy and please all readers . Quite the contrary , '' ","i":261712},{"w":"`` That is not where the mistake is , '' ","i":262650},{"w":"`` it is , that before the ass has turned up , the author speaks of Sancho as being mounted on it .

It will be a wonder if he succeeds , for it will be only hurry , hurry , with him , like the tailor on Easter Eve ; and works done in a hurry are never finished as perfectly as they ought to be . Let master Moor , or whatever he is , pay attention to what he is doing , and I and my master will give him as much grouting ready to his hand , in the way of adventures and accidents of all sorts , as would make up not only one second part , but a hundred . The good man fancies , no doubt , that we are fast asleep in the straw here , but let him hold up our feet to be shod and he will see which foot it is we go lame on . All I say is , that if my master would take my advice , we would be now afield , redressing outrages and righting wrongs , as is the use and custom of good knights-errant . Sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of Rocinante fell upon their ears , which neighing Don Quixote accepted as a happy omen , and he resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time . Announcing his intention to the bachelor , he asked his advice as to the quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition , and the bachelor replied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of Aragon , and the city of Saragossa , where there were to be certain solemn joustings at the festival of St. George , at which he might win renown above all the knights of Aragon , which would be winning it above all the knights of the world . He commended his very praiseworthy and gallant resolution , but admonished him to proceed with greater caution in encountering dangers , because his life did not belong to him , but to all those who had need of him to protect and aid them in their misfortunes .

But what is most needful , sirs , is that each of us should choose the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in his verses , and that we should not leave a tree , be it ever so hard , without writing up and carving her name on it , as is the habit and custom of love-smitten shepherds . '' ","i":489816},{"w":"`` if they fail us , we can call them by the names of the ones in print that the world is filled with , Filidas , Amarilises , Dianas , Fleridas , Galateas , Belisardas ; for as they sell them in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our own . If my lady , or I should say my shepherdess , happens to be called Ana , I 'll sing her praises under the name of Anarda , and if Francisca , I 'll call her Francenia , and if Lucia , Lucinda , for it all comes to the same thing ; and Sancho Panza , if he joins this fraternity , may glorify his wife Teresa Panza as Teresaina . Don Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name , and the curate bestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had made , and again offered to bear him company all the time that he could spare from his imperative duties . And so they took their leave of him , recommending and beseeching him to take care of his health and treat himself to a suitable diet . It so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three of them said ; and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in to Don Quixote , and said the niece , Now that we were thinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quiet respectable life there , are you going to get into fresh entanglements , and turn ` young shepherd , thou that comest here , young shepherd going there ?

binding words and extravagant oaths gave me his promise to become my husband ; though before he had made an end of pledging himself I bade him consider well what he was doing , and think of the anger his father would feel at seeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals ; I told him not to let my beauty , such as it was , blind him , for that was not enough to furnish an excuse for his transgression ; and if in the love he bore me he wished to do me any kindness , it would be to leave my lot to follow its course at the level my condition required ; for marriages so unequal never brought happiness , nor did they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began with . I said to him , and much more which I can not recollect ; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his purpose ; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself about difficulties when he is striking the bargain . At the same time I argued the matter briefly in my own mind , saying to myself , ' I shall not be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station , nor will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or , as is more likely , a blind attachment , has led to mate himself below his rank . Then , since I am introducing no new usage or practice , I may as well avail myself of the honour that chance offers me , for even though his inclination for me should not outlast the attainment of his wishes And if I strive to repel him by scorn , I can see that , fair means failing , he is in a mood to use force , and I shall be left dishonoured and without any means of proving my innocence to those who can not know how innocently I have come to be in this position ; for what arguments would persuade my parents that this gentleman entered my chamber without my consent ? ' '' ","i":133477},{"w":"`` This sad intelligence reached my ears , and , instead of being struck with a chill , with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I scarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets , crying aloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was the victim ; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a resolution I formed , to be carried out the same night , and that was to assume this dress , which I got from a servant of my father 's , one of the zagals , as they are called in farmhouses , to whom I confided the whole of my misfortune , and whom I entreated to accompany me to the city where I heard my enemy was . He , though he remonstrated with me for my boldness , and condemned my resolution , when he saw me bent upon my purpose , offered to bear me company , as he said , to the end of the world . I at once packed up in a linen pillow-case a woman 's dress , and some jewels and money to provide for emergencies , and in the silence of the night , without letting my treacherous maid know , I sallied forth from the house , accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties , and on foot set out for the city , but borne as it were on wings by my eagerness to reach it , if not to prevent what I presumed to be already done , at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with what conscience he had done it . I reached my destination in two days and a half , and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda 's parents . The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I sought to know ; he showed me the house , and told me all that had occurred at the betrothal of the daughter of the family , an affair of such notoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in the street . He said that on the night of Don Fernando 's betrothal with Luscinda , as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying ` Yes , ' she was taken with a sudden fainting fit , and that on the bridegroom approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air , he found a paper in her own handwriting , in which she said and declared that she could not be Don Fernando 's bride , because she was already Cardenio 's , who , according to the man 's account , was a gentleman of distinction of the same city ; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando , it was only in obedience to her parents .

In short , I told him I did not venture to mention it to my father , as well on account of that difficulty , as of many others that discouraged me though I knew not well what they were , only that it seemed to me that what I desired was never to come to pass .

You are now of an age to choose your line of life or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour and profit when you are older ; and what I have resolved to do is to divide my property into four parts ; three I will give to you , to each his portion without making any difference , and the other I will retain to live upon and support myself for whatever remainder of life My father had three , all sons , and all of sufficient age to make choice of a profession . Heaven may be pleased to grant me . But I wish each of you on taking possession of the share that falls to him to follow one of the paths I shall indicate . In this Spain of ours there is a proverb , to my mind very true -- as they all are , being short aphorisms drawn from long practical experience -- and the one I refer to says , ` The church , or the sea , or the king 's house ; ' as much as to say , in plainer language , whoever wants to flourish and become rich , let him follow the church , or go to sea , adopting commerce as his calling , or go into the king 's service in his household , for they say , ` Better a king 's crumb than a lord 's favour . ' I say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you should follow letters , another trade , and the third serve the king in the wars , for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service in his household , and if war does not bring much wealth it confers great distinction and fame . Eight days hence I will give you your full shares in money , without defrauding you of a farthing , as you will see in the end . Now tell me if you are willing to follow out my idea and advice as I have laid it before you . Having called upon me as the eldest to answer , I , after urging him not to strip himself of his property but to spend it all as he pleased , for we were young men able to gain our living , consented to comply with his wishes , and said that mine were to follow the profession of arms and thereby serve God and my king . My second brother having made the same proposal , decided upon going to the Indies , embarking the portion that fell to him in trade . The youngest , and in my opinion the wisest , said he would rather follow the church , or go to complete his studies at Salamanca . As soon as we had come to an understanding , and made choice of our professions , my father embraced us all , and in the short time he mentioned carried into effect all he had promised ; and when he had given to each his share , which as well as I remember was three thousand ducats apiece in cash -LRB- for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid for it down , not to let it go out of the family -RRB- , we all three on the same day took leave of our good father ; and at the same time , as it seemed to me inhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in his old age , I induced him to take two of my three thousand ducats , as the remainder would be enough to provide me with all a soldier needed . My two brothers , moved by my example , gave him each a thousand ducats , so that there was left for my father four thousand ducats in money , besides three thousand , the value of the portion that fell to him which he preferred to retain in land instead of selling it . Finally , as I said , we took leave of him , and of our uncle whom I have mentioned , not without sorrow and tears on both sides , they charging us to let them know whenever an opportunity offered how we fared , whether well or ill . We promised to do so , and when he had embraced us and given us his blessing , one set out for Salamanca , the other for Seville , and I for Alicante , where I had heard there was a Genoese vessel taking in a cargo of wool for Genoa . It is now some twenty-two years since I left my father 's house , and all that time , though I have written several letters , I have had no news whatever of him or of my brothers ; my own adventures during that period I will now relate briefly . I embarked at Alicante , reached Genoa after a prosperous voyage , and proceeded thence to Milan , where I provided myself with arms and a few soldier 's accoutrements ; thence it was my intention to go and take service in Piedmont , but as I was already on the road to Alessandria della Paglia , I learned that the great Duke of Alva was on his way to Flanders . I changed my plans , joined him , served under him in the campaigns he made , was present at the deaths of the Counts Egmont and Horn , and was promoted to be ensign under a famous captain of Guadalajara , Diego de Urbina by name . Some time after my arrival in Flanders news came of the league that his Holiness Pope Pius V of happy memory , had made with Venice and Spain against the common enemy , the Turk , who had just then with his fleet taken the famous island of Cyprus , which belonged to the Venetians , a loss deplorable and disastrous . It was known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of Austria , natural brother of our good king Don Philip , was coming as commander-in-chief of the allied forces , and rumours were abroad of the vast warlike preparations which were being made , all which stirred my heart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign which was expected ; and though I had reason to believe , and almost certain promises , that on the first opportunity that presented itself I should be promoted to be captain , I preferred to leave all and betake myself , as I did , to Italy ; and it was my good fortune that Don John had just arrived at Genoa , and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian fleet , as he afterwards did at Messina . I may say , in short , that I took part in that glorious expedition , promoted by this time to be a captain of infantry , to which honourable charge my good luck rather than my merits raised me ; and that day -- so fortunate for Christendom , because then all the nations of the earth were disabused of the error under which they lay in imagining the Turks to be invincible on sea-on that day , I say , on which the Ottoman pride and arrogance were broken , among all that were there made happy -LRB- for the Christians who died that day were happier than those who remained alive and victorious -RRB- had it been in Roman times , on the night that followed that famous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my hands . It happened in this way : El Uchali , the king of Algiers , a daring and successful corsair , having attacked and taken the leading Maltese galley -LRB- only three knights being left alive in it , and they badly wounded -RRB- , the chief galley of John Andrea , on board of which I and my company were placed , came to its relief , and doing as was bound to do in such a case , I leaped on board the enemy 's galley , which , sheering off from that which had attacked it , prevented my men from following me , and so I found myself alone in the midst of my enemies , who were in such numbers that I was unable to resist ; in short I was taken , covered with wounds ; El Uchali , as you know , sirs , made his escape with his entire squadron , and I was left a prisoner in his power , the only sad being among so many filled with joy , and the only captive among so many free ; for there were fifteen thousand Christians , all at the oar in the Turkish fleet , that regained their longed-for liberty that day . They carried me to Constantinople , where the Grand Turk , Selim , made my master general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and carried off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of Malta . The following year , which was the year seventy-two , I found myself at Navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three lanterns . There I saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the whole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost ; for all the marines and janizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to be attacked inside the very harbour , and had their kits and pasamaques , or shoes , ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed , in so great fear ''

'' ","i":136333},{"w":"`` I am that unhappy being , senora , '' ","i":136696},{"w":"`` whom , as you have said , Luscinda declared to be her husband ; I am the unfortunate Cardenio , whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present condition has reduced to the state you see me in , bare , ragged , bereft of all human comfort , and what is worse , of reason , for I only possess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to me . I , Dorothea , am he who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando , and waited to hear the ` Yes ' uttered by which Luscinda owned herself his betrothed : I am he who had not courage enough to see how her fainting fit ended , or what came of the paper that was found in her bosom , because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokes of ill-fortune at once ; and so losing patience I quitted the house , and leaving a letter with my host , which I entreated him to place in Luscinda 's hands , I betook myself to these solitudes , resolved to end here the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy . But fate would not rid me of it , contenting itself with robbing me of my reason , perhaps to preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting you ; for if that which you have just told us be true , as I believe it to be , it may be that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination to our misfortunes than we look for ; because seeing that Luscinda can not marry Don Fernando , being mine , as she has herself so openly declared , and that Don Fernando can not marry her as he is yours , we may reasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours , as it is still in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed . And as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy , I entreat you , senora , to form new resolutions in your better mind , as I mean to do in mine , preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes ; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don Fernando , and if I can not by words induce him to recognise his obligation to you , in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me , and with just cause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you , not regarding my own wrongs , which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge , while I on earth devote myself to yours . Cardenio 's words completed the astonishment of Dorothea , and not knowing how to return thanks for such an offer , she attempted to kiss his feet ; but Cardenio would not permit it , and the licentiate replied for both , commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio , and lastly , begged , advised , and urged them to come with him to his village , where they might furnish themselves with what they needed , and take measures to discover Don Fernando , or restore Dorothea to her parents , or do what seemed to them most advisable . Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him , and accepted the kind offer he made them ; and the barber , who had been listening to all attentively and in silence , on his part some kindly words also , and with no less good-will than the curate offered his services in any way that might be of use to them . He also explained to them in a few words the object that had brought them there , and the strange nature of Don Quixote 's madness , and how they were waiting for his squire , who had gone in search of him . Like the recollection of a dream , the quarrel he had had with Don Quixote came back to Cardenio 's memory , and he described it to the others ; but he was unable to say what the dispute was about . At this moment they heard a shout , and recognised it as coming from Sancho Panza , who , not finding them where he had left them , was calling aloud to them . They went to meet him , and in answer to their inquiries about Don Quixote , he told them how he had found him stripped to his shirt , lank , yellow , half dead with hunger , and sighing for his lady Dulcinea ; and although he had told him that she commanded him to quit that place and come to El Toboso , where she was expecting him , he had answered that he was determined not to appear in the presence of her beauty until he had done deeds to make him worthy of her favour ; and if this went on , Sancho said , he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as in duty bound , or even an archbishop , which was the least he could be ; for which reason they ought to consider what was to be done to get him away from there . '' ","i":136709},{"w":"`` they completely transformed . But the best of it is , the story goes in the neighbourhood that those who attacked us belong to a number of galley slaves who , they say , were set free almost on the very same spot by a man of such valour that , in spite of the commissary and of the guards , he released the whole of them ; and beyond all doubt he must have been out of his senses , or he must be as great a scoundrel as they , or some man without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep , the fox among the hens , the fly among the honey . He has defrauded justice , and opposed his king and lawful master , for he opposed his just commands ; he has , I say , robbed the galleys of their feet , stirred up the Holy Brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet , and , lastly , has done a deed by which his soul may be lost without any gain to his body . Sancho had told the curate and the barber of the adventure of the galley slaves , which , so much to his glory , his master had achieved , and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most of it to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote ; who changed colour at every word , not daring to say that it was he who had been the liberator of those worthy people .

A little light reaches it through some chinks or crevices , communicating with it and open to the surface of the earth . This recess or space I perceived when I was already growing weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended by the rope , travelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty or knowledge of where I was going , so I resolved to enter it and rest myself for a while . I called out , telling you not to let out more rope until I bade you , but you can not have heard me . ADVENTURE TO BE DEEMED APOCRYPHAL I then gathered in the rope you were sending me , and making a coil or pile of it I seated myself upon it , ruminating and considering what I was to do to lower myself to the bottom , having no one to hold me up ; and as I was thus deep in thought and perplexity , suddenly and without provocation a profound sleep fell upon me , and when I least expected it , I know not how , I awoke and found myself in the midst of the most beautiful , delightful meadow that nature could produce or the most lively human imagination conceive . Nevertheless , I felt my head and breast to satisfy myself whether it was I myself who was there or some empty delusive phantom ; but touch , feeling , the collected thoughts that passed through my mind , all convinced me that I was the same then and there that I am this moment . Next there presented itself to my sight a stately royal palace or castle , with walls that seemed built of clear transparent crystal ; and through two great doors that opened wide therein , I saw coming forth and advancing towards me a venerable old man , clad in a long gown of mulberry-coloured serge that trailed upon the ground . On his shoulders and breast he had a green satin collegiate hood , and covering his head a black Milanese bonnet , and his snow-white beard fell below his girdle . He carried no arms whatever , nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fair-sized filberts , each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg ; his bearing , his gait , his dignity and imposing presence held me spellbound and wondering . He approached me , and the first thing he did was to embrace me closely , and then he said to me , ` For a long time now , O valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha , we who are here enchanted in these solitudes have been hoping to see thee , that thou mayest make known to the world what is shut up and concealed in this deep cave , called the cave of Montesinos , which thou hast entered , an achievement reserved for thy invincible heart and stupendous courage alone to attempt . Come with me , illustrious sir , and I will show thee the marvels hidden within this transparent castle , whereof I am the alcaide and perpetual warden ; for I am Montesinos himself , from whom the cave takes its name . ' The instant he told me he was Montesinos , I asked him if the story they told in the world above here was true , that he had taken out the heart of his great friend Durandarte from his breast with a little dagger , and carried it to the lady Belerma , as his friend when at the point of death had commanded him . He said in reply that they spoke the truth in every respect except as to the dagger , for it was not a dagger , nor little , but a burnished poniard sharper than an awl .

Anselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out the tragedy of the death of his honour , which the performers acted with such wonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had become the realities of the parts they played . He longed for night and an opportunity of escaping from the house to go and see his good friend Lothario , and with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he had gained in having established his wife 's purity . Both mistress and maid took care to give him time and opportunity to get away , and taking advantage of it he made his escape , and at once went in quest of Lothario , and it would be impossible to describe how he embraced him when he found him , and the things he said to him in the joy of his heart , and the praises he bestowed upon Camilla ; all which Lothario listened to without being able to show any pleasure , for he could not forget how deceived his friend was , and how dishonourably he had wronged him ; and though Anselmo could see that Lothario was not glad , still he imagined it was only because he had left Camilla wounded and had been himself the cause of it ; and so among other things he told him not to be distressed about Camilla 's accident , for , as they had agreed to hide it from him , the wound was evidently trifling ; and that being so , he had no cause for fear , but should henceforward be of good cheer and rejoice with him , seeing that by his means and adroitness he found himself raised to the greatest height of happiness that he could have ventured to hope for , and desired no better pastime than making verses in praise of Camilla that would preserve her name for all time to come . '' ","i":171548},{"w":"`` I am so agitated : leave me till to-morrow , and then you shall hear from me what will fill you with astonishment ; but rest assured that he who leaped through the window is a young man of this city , who has given me his promise to become my husband . Anselmo was appeased with this , and was content to wait the time she asked of him , for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla , so satisfied and sure of her virtue was he ; and so he quitted the room , and left Leonela locked in , telling her she should not come out until she had told him all she had to make known to him . He went at once to see Camilla , and tell her , as he did , all that had passed between him and her handmaid , and the promise she had given him to inform him matters of serious importance . There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not , for so great was her fear and dismay , that , making sure , as she had good reason to do , that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her faithlessness , she had not the courage to wait and see if her suspicions were confirmed ; and that same night , as soon as she thought that Anselmo was asleep , she packed up the most valuable jewels she had and some money , and without being observed by anybody escaped from the house and betook herself to Lothario 's , to whom she related what had occurred , imploring him to convey her to some place of safety or fly with her where they might be safe from Anselmo . The state of perplexity to which Camilla reduced Lothario was such that he was unable to utter a word in reply , still less to decide upon what he should do . At length he resolved to conduct her to a convent of which a sister of his was prioress ; Camilla agreed to this , and with the speed which the circumstances demanded , Lothario took her to the convent and left her there , and then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know of his departure . As soon as daylight came Anselmo , without missing Camilla from his side , rose eager to learn what Leonela had to tell him , and hastened to the room where he had locked her in .

But all his gallantry , wit , and gaiety , all his graces and accomplishments , would have been of little or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil , had not the impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first .

taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back ; but no instance occurred to his memory . We can see the whole scene at a glance , the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and the perplexity of his master , upon whose perception the incongruity has just forced itself . This is Sancho 's mission throughout the book ; he is an unconscious Mephistopheles , always unwittingly making mockery of his master 's aspirations , always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by some unintentional ad absurdum , always bringing him back to the world of fact and commonplace by force of sheer stolidity . By the time Cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands , and summoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest , the case was very much altered . Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had not merely found favour , but had already become , what they have never since ceased to be , veritable entities to the popular imagination . There was no occasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter ; nay , his readers told him plainly that what they wanted of him was more Don Quixote and more Sancho Panza , and not novels , tales , or digressions . In working out the new ideas , he soon found the value of Sancho Panza .

'' ","i":42908},{"w":"`` I will not , senor , '' ","i":43045},{"w":"`` specially as I have a man of such quality for a master in your worship , who will know how to give me all that will be suitable for me and that I can bear .

'' ","i":44036},{"w":"`` I have nothing to say ; but God knows I would rather your worship complained when anything ailed you . For my part , I confess I must complain however small the ache may be ; unless this rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also . Don Quixote could not help laughing at his squire 's simplicity , and he assured him he might complain whenever and however he chose , just as he liked , for , so far , he had never read of anything to the contrary in the order of knighthood . Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time , to which his master answered that he wanted nothing himself just then , but that he might eat when he had a mind . With this permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably as he could on his beast , and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed away in them , he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately , and from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied ; and while he went on in this way , gulping down draught after draught , he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him , nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures , however dangerous they might be . Finally they passed the night among some trees , from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a fashion as a lance , and fixed on it the head he had removed from the broken one . Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his lady Dulcinea , in order to conform to what he had read in his books , how many a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless supported by the memory of their mistresses . Not so did Sancho Panza spend it , for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it , and , if his master had not called him , neither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken him . On getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than the night before , which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the deficiency readily . Don Quixote did not care to break his fast , for , as has been already said , he confined himself to savoury recollections for nourishment . They returned to the road they had set out with , leading to Puerto Lapice , and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it . Here , brother Sancho Panza , '' ","i":44121},{"w":"`` your worship shall be fully obeyed in this matter ; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no friend to mixing in strife and quarrels : it is true that as regards the defence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws , for laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any assailant whatever .

Let your worship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads , nothing but carriers and carters , who not only do not wear helmets , but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives .

So , senor , as for these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry , exchange them for other things which may be of more use and advantage to me ; for these , though I fully acknowledge them as received , I renounce from this moment to the end of the world .

The ass is in proper trim , the mountains are near at hand , hunger presses , we have nothing more to do but make good our retreat , and , as the saying is , the dead to the grave and the living to the loaf . And driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow , who , feeling that Sancho was right , did so without replying ; and after proceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves in a wide and retired valley , where they alighted , and Sancho unloaded his beast , and stretched upon the green grass , with hunger for sauce , they breakfasted , dined , lunched , and supped all at once , satisfying their appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead man 's clerical gentlemen -LRB- who seldom put themselves on short allowance -RRB- had brought with them on their sumpter mule . But another piece of ill-luck befell them , which Sancho held the worst of all , and that was that they had no wine to drink , nor even water to moisten their lips ; and as thirst tormented them , Sancho , observing that the meadow where they were was full of green and tender grass , said what will be told in the following chapter .

What was , was ; and may the good that is to come be for all , and the evil for him who goes to look for it -- your worship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their tales was not just as each one pleased ; it was a maxim of Cato Zonzorino the Roman , that says ` the evil for him that goes to look for it , ' and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger , to show that your worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any quarter , and that we should go back by some other road , since nobody forces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us . '' ","i":85675},{"w":"`` I say then , '' ","i":85857},{"w":"`` that in a village of Estremadura there was a goat-shepherd -- that is to say , one who tended goats -- which shepherd or goatherd , as my story goes , was called Lope Ruiz , and this Lope Ruiz was in love with a shepherdess called Torralva , which shepherdess called Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier , and this rich grazier - '' ","i":85866},{"w":"`` If that is the way thou tellest thy tale , Sancho , '' ","i":85934},{"w":"`` and I can not tell it in any other , nor is it right of your worship to ask me to make new customs .

And so in course of time , the devil , who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion , contrived that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into hatred and ill-will , and the reason , according to evil tongues , was some little jealousy she caused him that crossed the line and trespassed on forbidden ground ; and so much did the shepherd hate her from that time forward that , in order to escape from her , he determined to quit the country and go where he should never set eyes on her again . Torralva , when she found herself spurned by Lope , was immediately smitten with love for him , though she had never loved him before . '' ","i":86158},{"w":"`` It came to pass , '' ","i":86355},{"w":"`` that the shepherd carried out his intention , and driving his goats before him took his way across the plains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal . Torralva , who knew of it , went after him , and on foot and barefoot followed him at a distance , with a pilgrim 's staff in her hand and a scrip round her neck , in which she carried , it is said , a bit of looking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of paint for her face ; but let her carry what she did , I am not going to trouble myself to prove it ; all I say is , that the shepherd , they say , came with his flock to cross over the river Guadiana , which was at that time swollen and almost overflowing its banks , and at the spot he came to there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his flock to the other side , at which he was much vexed , for he perceived that Torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with her tears and entreaties ; however , he went looking about so closely that he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so small that it could only hold one person and one goat ; but for all that he spoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred goats across . The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over ; he came back and carried another over ; he came back again , and again brought over another -- let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across , for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story , and it will be impossible to tell another word of it . To proceed , I must tell you the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery , and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming ; still he returned for another goat , and another , and another .

From all I have said thou wilt gather , Sancho , that there must be a difference between master and man , between lord and lackey , between knight and squire : so that from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe more respect and take less liberties , for in whatever way I may be provoked with you it will be bad for the pitcher .

For God 's sake , Sancho , restrain thyself , and do n't show the thread so as to let them see what a coarse , boorish texture thou art of . Remember , sinner that thou art , the master is the more esteemed the more respectable and well-bred his servants are ; and that one of the greatest advantages that princes have over other men is that they have servants as good as themselves to wait on them . if they perceive thee to be a coarse clown or a dull blockhead , they will suspect me to be some impostor or swindler ? Sancho friend , keep clear , oh , keep clear of these stumbling-blocks ; for he who falls into the way of being a chatterbox and droll , drops into a wretched buffoon the first time he trips ; bridle thy tongue , consider and weigh thy words before they escape thy mouth , and bear in mind we are now in quarters whence , by God 's help , and the strength of my arm , we shall come forth mightily advanced in fame and fortune . Sancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut , and to bite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogether to the purpose and well considered , and told him he might make his mind easy on that point , for it should never be discovered through him what they were . Don Quixote dressed himself , put on his baldric with his sword , threw the scarlet mantle over his shoulders , placed on his head a montera of green satin that the damsels had given him , and thus arrayed passed out into the large room , where he found the damsels drawn up in double file , the same number on each side , all with the appliances for washing the hands , which they presented to him with profuse obeisances and ceremonies . Then came twelve pages , together with the seneschal , to lead him to dinner , as his hosts were already waiting for him . They placed him in the midst of them , and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another room , where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers . The duchess and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him , and with them a grave ecclesiastic , one of those who rule noblemen 's houses ; one of those who , not being born magnates themselves , never know how to teach those who are how to behave as such ; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind ; one of those who , when they try to introduce economy into the household they rule , lead it into meanness . One of this sort , I say , must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote . A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged , and at length , taking Don Quixote between them , they proceeded to sit down to table .

THE PEERLESS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO , WHICH IS ONE OF THE RAREST ADVENTURES IN THIS BOOK Great was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza ; and , more bent than ever upon the plan they had of practising some jokes upon them that should have the look and appearance of adventures , they took as their basis of action what Don Quixote had already told them about the cave of Montesinos , in order to play him a famous one .

I who counted upon my good fortune to discharge the recompense of thy services , find myself still waiting for advancement , while thou , before the time , and contrary to all reasonable expectation , seest thyself blessed in the fulfillment of thy desires . Some will bribe , beg , solicit , rise early , entreat , persist , without attaining the object of their suit ; while another comes , and without knowing why or wherefore , finds himself invested with the place or office so many have sued for ; and here it is that the common saying , ` There is good luck as well as bad luck in suits , ' applies . Thou , who , to my thinking , art beyond all doubt a dullard , without early rising or night watching or taking any trouble , with the mere breath of knight-errantry that has breathed upon thee , seest thyself without more ado governor of an island , as though it were a mere matter of course . This I say , Sancho , that thou attribute not the favour thou hast received to thine own merits , but give thanks to heaven that disposes matters beneficently , and secondly thanks to the great power the profession of knight-errantry contains in itself . With a heart , then , inclined to believe what I have said to thee , attend , my son , to thy Cato here who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guide to direct and pilot thee to a safe haven out of this stormy sea wherein thou art about to ingulf thyself ; for offices and great trusts are nothing else but a mighty gulf of troubles . First of all , my son , thou must fear God , for in the fear of him is wisdom , and being wise thou canst not err in aught . Secondly , thou must keep in view what thou art , striving to know thyself , the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagine . If thou knowest thyself , it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up like the frog that strove to make himself as large as the ox ; if thou dost , the recollection of having kept pigs in thine own country will serve as the ugly feet for the wheel of thy folly .

While all were , as has been said , observing him , suddenly from among the duennas and handmaidens the impudent and witty Altisidora lifted up her voice and said in pathetic tones : Give ear , cruel knight ; '' ","i":438788},{"w":"`` It does not seem to me well done in you , sir knight , that after having received the hospitality that has been offered you in this very castle , you should have ventured to carry off even three kerchiefs , not to say my handmaid 's garters .

I say this , Sancho , because thou hast seen the good cheer , the abundance we have enjoyed in this castle we are leaving ; well then , amid those dainty banquets and snow-cooled beverages I felt as though I were undergoing the straits of hunger , because I did not enjoy them with the same freedom as if they had been mine own ; for the sense of being under an obligation to return benefits and favours received is a restraint that checks the independence of the spirit .

In conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing their journey , when , after they had gone a little more than half a league , they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched upon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner .

For indeed and in truth many a time I stop to look at your worship from the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your head , and I see more to frighten one than to make one fall in love ; moreover I have heard say that beauty is the first and main thing that excites love , and as your worship has none at all , I do n't know what the poor creature fell in love with .

Don Quixote thanked him , and ate a little , and Sancho a good deal , and then they both lay down to sleep , leaving those two inseparable friends and comrades , Rocinante and Dapple , to their own devices and to feed unrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was furnished . They woke up rather late , mounted once more and resumed their journey , pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight , apparently a league off .

Roque , who was paying more attention to the fair Claudia 's adventure than to the words of master or man , did not hear them ; and ordering his squires to restore to Sancho everything they had stripped Dapple of , he directed them to return to the place where they had been quartered during the night , and then set off with Claudia at full speed in search of the wounded or slain Don Vicente . They reached the spot where Claudia met him , but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood ; looking all round , however , they descried some people on the slope of a hill above them , and concluded , as indeed it proved to be , that it was Don Vicente , whom either dead or alive his servants were removing to attend to his wounds or to bury him .
