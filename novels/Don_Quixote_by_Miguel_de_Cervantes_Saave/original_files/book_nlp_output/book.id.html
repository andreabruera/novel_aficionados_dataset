<p/>ADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEAT HE (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) BROUGHT TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE I: ABOUT THIS TRANSLATION
<p/>It was with considerable reluctance that I abandoned in favour of the present undertaking what had long been a favourite project: that of a new edition of Shelton's <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shelton</b></font>)</div>which has now become a somewhat scarce book.
<p/>There are some--and I confess myself to be one--for whom Shelton's racy old version, with all its defects, has a charm that no modern translation, however skilful or correct, could possess.
<p/>Shelton had the inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation as Cervantes; <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>had to him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) a vitality that only a contemporary could feel; it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) no dramatic effort to see things as Cervantes saw them; there is no anachronism in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) language; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) put the Spanish of Cervantes into the English of Shakespeare.
<p/>Shakespeare himself most likely knew the book; he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) may have carried it home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) saddle-bags to Stratford on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) last journeys, and under the mulberry tree at New Place joined hands with a kindred genius in its pages.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) fine old crusted English would, no doubt, be relished by a minority, but it would be only by a minority.
<p/>But it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderate popularity for Shelton was vain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) warmest admirers must admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) is not a satisfactory representative of Cervantes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) translation of the First Part was very hastily made and was never revised by him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>). It has all the freshness and vigour, but also a full measure of the faults, of a hasty production.
<p/>It is often very literal--barbarously literal frequently--but just as often very loose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had evidently a good colloquial knowledge of Spanish, but apparently not much more.
<p/>It never seems to occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) that the same translation of a word will not suit in every case. It is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of ``Don Quixote.
<p/>To those who are familiar with the original, it savours of truism or platitude to say so, for in truth there can be no thoroughly satisfactory translation of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>into English or any other language.
<p/>It is not that the Spanish idioms are so utterly unmanageable, or that the untranslatable words, numerous enough no doubt, are so superabundant, but rather that the sententious terseness to which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to Spanish, and can at best be only distantly imitated in any other tongue.
<p/>'' The history of our English translations of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Shelton</b></font>)</div>is instructive. Shelton's, the first in any language, was made, apparently, about 1608, but not published till 1612.
<p/>It has been asserted that the Second, published in 1620, is not the work of Shelton, but there is nothing to support the assertion save the fact that it has less spirit, less of what we generally understand by <div class="bookquote">``go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Shelton</b></font>)</div>about it than the first, which would be only natural if the first were the work of a young man writing currente calamo, and the second that of a middle-aged man writing for a bookseller.
<p/>On the other hand, it is closer and more literal, the style is the same, the very same translations, or mistranslations, occur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a new translator would, by suppressing his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) name, have allowed Shelton to carry off the credit.
<p/>In 1687 John Phillips, Milton's nephew, produced a <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Milton nephew</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``made English,''  (<font color='red'><b>Milton nephew</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) says, ``according to the humour of our modern language.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned</b></font>)</div>is not so much a translation as a travesty, and a travesty that for coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almost unexampled even in the literature of that day.
<p/>Ned Ward's <div class="bookquote">``Life and Notable Adventures of Don Quixote, merrily translated into Hudibrastic Verse''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned Ward</b></font>)</div>-LRB-1700-RRB-, can scarcely be reckoned a translation, but it serves to show the light in which <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned Ward</b></font>)</div>was regarded at the time.
<p/>A further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 by Peter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing with literature.
<p/>It is described as <div class="bookquote">``translated from the original by several hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but if so all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the manipulation of the several hands.
<p/>This of course was only the First Part. '' The flavour that it has, on the other hand, is distinctly Franco-cockney.
<p/>Anyone who compares it carefully with the original will have little doubt that it is a concoction from Shelton and the French of Filleau de Saint Martin, eked out by borrowings from Phillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts.
<p/>It is, to be sure, more decent and decorous, but it treats <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in the same fashion as a comic book that cannot be made too comic.
<p/>To attempt to improve the humour of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Motteux</b></font>)</div>by an infusion of cockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux's operators did, is not merely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but an absolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof of the uncritical way in which <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Motteux operators</b></font>)</div>is generally read that this worse than worthless translation--worthless as failing to represent, worse than worthless as misrepresenting--should have been favoured as it has been.
<p/>It had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertaken and executed in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, the portrait painter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay.
<p/>Jervas has been allowed little credit for his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) work, indeed it may be said none, for it is known to the world in general as Jarvis's.
<p/>It was not published until after his (<font color='blue'><b>Jarvis</b></font>) death, and the printers gave the name according to the current pronunciation of the day.
<p/>It has seen far more editions than any other, it is admitted on all hands to be by far the most faithful, and yet nobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author.
<p/>Jervas no doubt prejudiced readers against himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) preface, where among many true words about Shelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stevens</b></font>) rashly and unjustly charges Shelton with having translated not from the Spanish, but from the Italian version of Franciosini, which did not appear until ten years after Shelton's first volume.
<p/>A suspicion of incompetence, too, seems to have attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) was by profession a painter and a mediocre one -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) has given us the best portrait we have of Swift-RRB-, and this may have been strengthened by Pope's remark that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``translated `Don Quixote' without understanding Spanish.
<p/>It has been the most freely used and the most freely abused of all the translations. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) has been also charged with borrowing from Shelton, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) disparaged.
<p/>It is true that in a few difficult or obscure passages he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) has followed Shelton, and gone astray with him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>); but for one case of this sort, there are fifty where he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) is right and Shelton wrong.
<p/>As for Pope's dictum, anyone who examines Jervas's version carefully, side by side with the original, will see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) was a sound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better one than Shelton, except perhaps in mere colloquial Spanish.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shelton</b></font>) was, in fact, an honest, faithful, and painstaking translator, and he (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) has left a version which, whatever its shortcomings may be, is singularly free from errors and mistranslations.
<p/>The charge against it is that it is stiff, dry--<div class="bookquote">``wooden''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in a word,-and no one can deny that there is a foundation for it.
<p/>But it may be pleaded for Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) abhorrence of the light, flippant, jocose style of his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) predecessors.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) was one of the few, very few, translators that have shown any apprehension of the unsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotic humour; it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirking and grinning at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) own good things, and to this may be attributed in a great measure the ascetic abstinence from everything savouring of liveliness which is the characteristic of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) translation.
<p/>In most modern editions, it should be observed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) style has been smoothed and smartened, but without any reference to the original Spanish, so that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) has been made to read more agreeably he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) has also been robbed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) chief merit of fidelity.
<p/>At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas's translation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original Spanish.
<p/>Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these. The later translations may be dismissed in a few words.
<p/>George Kelly's, which appeared in 1769, <div class="bookquote">``printed for the Translator,''  (<font color='red'><b>George Kelly</b></font>)</div>was an impudent imposture, being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the words, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's -LRB-1774-RRB- was only an abridgment like Florian's, but not so skilfully executed; and the version published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Motteux</b></font>) brother's plates, was merely a patchwork production made out of former translations.
<p/>On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be in every sense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here.
<p/>I had not even seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since then I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr. Duffield's reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes.
<p/>From the foregoing history of our translations of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>a people</b></font>)</div>it will be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) ideas.
<p/>On the other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not merely the story he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) tells, but the story as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) tells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.
<p/>But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or why a translator who makes it his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) aim to treat <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>a translator</b></font>)</div>with the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book.
<p/>It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) who makes so.
<p/>The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the great majority of English readers.
<p/>At any rate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator's duty as fidelity to the matter.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) can please all parties, so much the better; but his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) first duty is to those who look to him (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) for as faithful a representation of his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) author as it is in his (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) power to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful to the spirit so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) can make it.
<p/>My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to indicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow, in the present instance.
<p/>One which, it seems to me, cannot be too rigidly followed in translating <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>is to avoid everything that savours of affectation.
<p/>The book itself is, indeed, in one sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more than Cervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to use antiquated or obsolete language should be resisted.
<p/>Spanish has probably undergone less change since the seventeenth century than any language in Europe, and by far the greater and certainly the best part of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>differs but little in language from the colloquial Spanish of the present day.
<p/>Except in the tales and Don Quixote's speeches, the translator who uses the simplest and plainest everyday language will almost always be the one who approaches nearest to the original.
<p/>Seeing that the story of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>all characters</b></font>)</div>and all its characters and incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar as household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason.
<p/>Of course a translator who holds that <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>a translator</b></font>)</div>should receive the treatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the injunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap.
<p/>It is after all an affectation, and one for which there is no warrant or excuse. IX not to omit or add anything.
<p/>ABOUT CERVANTES AND DON QUIXOTE Four generations had laughed over <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>DON QUIXOTE Four generations</b></font>)</div>before it occurred to anyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for a satisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of the author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret's instance in 1738.
<p/>Any floating traditions that may once have existed, transmitted from men who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Carteret</b></font>), had long since died out, and of other record there was none; for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were incurious as to <div class="bookquote">``the men of the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>a reproach against which the nineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself, if it has produced no Shakespeare or Cervantes.
<p/>All that Mayans y Siscar, to whom the task was entrusted, or any of those who followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayans</b></font>), Rios, Pellicer, or Navarrete, could do was to eke out the few allusions Cervantes makes to himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence bearing upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) life as they could find.
<p/>II: All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time disappeared. This, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such good purpose that he (<font color='blue'><b>biographer</b></font>) has superseded all predecessors.
<p/>Besides sifting, testing, and methodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previously brought to light, he (<font color='blue'><b>biographer</b></font>) left, as the saying is, no stone unturned under which anything to illustrate his (<font color='blue'><b>biographer</b></font>) subject might possibly be found.
<p/>Navarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do, and it is no fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Navarrete</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Navarrete</b></font>) has not given us what we want.
<p/>Thoroughness is the chief characteristic of Navarrete's work. What Hallam says of Shakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes:
<p/>``It is not the register of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) baptism, or the draft of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) will, or the orthography of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) name that we seek; no letter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) writing, no record of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) conversation, no character of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) drawn ... by a contemporary has been produced.
<p/>It is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes, forced to make brick without straw, should have recourse largely to conjecture, and that conjecture should in some instances come by degrees to take the place of established fact.
<p/>All that I propose to do here is to separate what is matter of fact from what is matter of conjecture, and leave it to the reader's judgment to decide whether the data justify the inference or not.
<p/>The men whose names by common consent stand in the front rank of Spanish literature, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Calderon, Garcilaso de la Vega, the Mendozas, Gongora, were all men of ancient families, and, curiously, all, except the last, of families that traced their origin to the same mountain district in the North of Spain.
<p/>The family of Cervantes is commonly said to have been of Galician origin, and unquestionably it was in possession of lands in Galicia at a very early date; but I think the balance of the evidence tends to show that the <div class="bookquote">``solar,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the original site of the family, was at Cervatos in the north-west corner of Old Castile, close to the junction of Castile, Leon, and the Asturias.
<p/>As it happens, there is a complete history of the Cervantes family from the tenth century down to the seventeenth extant under the title of <div class="bookquote">``Illustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, and Noble Posterity of the Famous Nuno Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Cervantes family</b></font>)</div>written in 1648 by the industrious genealogist Rodrigo Mendez Silva, who availed himself of a manuscript genealogy by Juan de Mena, the poet laureate and historiographer of John II.
<p/>Nuno Alfonso was almost as distinguished in the struggle against the Moors in the reign of Alfonso VII as the Cid had been half a century before in that of Alfonso VI, and was rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of Toledo.
<p/>On one of his (<font color='blue'><b>VI</b></font>) acquisitions, about two leagues from the city, he (<font color='blue'><b>VI</b></font>) built himself a castle which he (<font color='blue'><b>VI</b></font>) called Cervatos, because <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>VI</b></font>) was lord of the solar of Cervatos in the Montana,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the mountain region extending from the Basque Provinces to Leon was always called.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) death in battle in 1143, the castle passed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) will to his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) son Alfonso Munio, who, as territorial or local surnames were then coming into vogue in place of the simple patronymic, took the additional name of Cervatos.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Alfonso</b></font>) eldest son Pedro succeeded him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) in the possession of the castle, and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) example in adopting the name, an assumption at which the younger son, Gonzalo, seems to have taken umbrage.
<p/>Everyone who has paid even a flying visit to Toledo will remember the ruined castle that crowns the hill above the spot where the bridge of Alcantara spans the gorge of the Tagus, and with its broken outline and crumbling walls makes such an admirable pendant to the square solid Alcazar towering over the city roofs on the opposite side.
<p/>It was built, or as some say restored, by Alfonso VI shortly after his (<font color='blue'><b>VI</b></font>) occupation of Toledo in 1085, and called by him (<font color='blue'><b>VI</b></font>) San Servando after a Spanish martyr, a name subsequently modified into San Servan -LRB-in which form it appears in the <div class="bookquote">``Poem of the Cid'' (<font color='red'><b>San</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, San Servantes, and San Cervantes: with regard to which last the <div class="bookquote">``Handbook for Spain''  (<font color='red'><b>San Cervantes</b></font>)</div>warns its readers against the supposition that it has anything to do with the author of ``Don Quixote.
<p/>Ford, as all know who have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) for a companion and counsellor on the roads of Spain, is seldom wrong in matters of literature or history.
<p/>It has everything to do with the author of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>for it is in fact these old walls that have given to Spain the name she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) is proudest of to-day.
<p/>Gonzalo, above mentioned, it may be readily conceived, did not relish the appropriation by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) brother of a name to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) himself had an equal right, for though nominally taken from the castle, it was in reality derived from the ancient territorial possession of the family, and as a set-off, and to distinguish himself -LRB-diferenciarse-RRB- from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) took as a surname the name of the castle on the bank of the Tagus, in the building of which, according to a family tradition, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) great-grandfather had a share.
<p/>'' The origin of the name Cervantes is curious. '' In this instance, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) is in error. Both brothers founded families.
<p/>The Cervantes branch had more tenacity; it sent offshoots in various directions, Andalusia, Estremadura, Galicia, and Portugal, and produced a goodly line of men distinguished in the service of Church and State.
<p/>Gonzalo himself, and apparently a son of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>), followed Ferdinand III in the great campaign of 1236-48 that gave Cordova and Seville to Christian Spain and penned up the Moors in the kingdom of Granada, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) descendants intermarried with some of the noblest families of the Peninsula and numbered among them soldiers, magistrates, and Church dignitaries, including at least two cardinal-archbishops.
<p/>Of the line that settled in Andalusia, Deigo de Cervantes, Commander of the Order of Santiago, married Juana Avellaneda, daughter of Juan Arias de Saavedra, and had several sons, of whom one was Gonzalo Gomez, Corregidor of Jerez and ancestor of the Mexican and Columbian branches of the family; and another, Juan, whose son Rodrigo married Dona Leonor de Cortinas, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dona</b></font>) had four children, Rodrigo, Andrea, Luisa, and Miguel, our author.
<p/>A man who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights-errant extending from well-nigh the time of Pelayo to the siege of Granada was likely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry of the romances.
<p/>It gives a point, too, to what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says in more than one place about families that have once been great and have tapered away until they have come to nothing, like a pyramid.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was born at Alcala de Henares and baptised in the church of Santa Maria Mayor on the 9th of October, 1547.
<p/>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) boyhood and youth we know nothing, unless it be from the glimpse he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) gives us in the preface to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Comedies''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of himself as a boy looking on with delight while Lope de Rueda and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) company set up their rude plank stage in the plaza and acted the rustic farces which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) himself afterwards took as the model of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) interludes.
<p/>This first glimpse, however, is a significant one, for it shows the early development of that love of the drama which exercised such an influence on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life and seems to have grown stronger as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grew older, and of which this very preface, written only a few months before his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) death, is such a striking proof.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gives us to understand, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a great reader in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) youth; but of this no assurance was needed, for the First Part of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>youth</b></font>)</div>alone proves a vast amount of miscellaneous reading, romances of chivalry, ballads, popular poetry, chronicles, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) had no time or opportunity except in the first twenty years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) life; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) misquotations and mistakes in matters of detail are always, it may be noticed, those of a man recalling the reading of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boyhood.
<p/>The pedigree of Cervantes is not without its bearing on <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes</b></font>)</div>It was the case of his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) own. Other things besides the drama were in their infancy when Cervantes was a boy.
<p/>The period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) boyhood was in every way a transition period for Spain. The old chivalrous Spain had passed away.
<p/>The new Spain was the mightiest power the world had seen since the Roman Empire and it had not yet been called upon to pay the price of its greatness.
<p/>By the policy of Ferdinand and Ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute, and the Church and Inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferdinand</b></font>) so.
<p/>The nobles, who had always resisted absolutism as strenuously as they had fought the Moors, had been divested of all political power, a like fate had befallen the cities, the free constitutions of Castile and Aragon had been swept away, and the only function that remained to the Cortes was that of granting money at the King's dictation.
<p/>Men who, like Garcilaso de la Vega and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, followed the Italian wars, had brought back from Italy the products of the post-Renaissance literature, which took root and flourished and even threatened to extinguish the native growths.
<p/>Damon and Thyrsis, Phyllis and Chloe had been fairly naturalised in Spain, together with all the devices of pastoral poetry for investing with an air of novelty the idea of a dispairing shepherd and inflexible shepherdess.
<p/>As a set-off against this, the old historical and traditional ballads, and the true pastorals, the songs and ballads of peasant life, were being collected assiduously and printed in the cancioneros that succeeded one another with increasing rapidity.
<p/>But the most notable consequence, perhaps, of the spread of printing was the flood of romances of chivalry that had continued to pour from the press ever since Garci Ordonez de Montalvo had resuscitated <div class="bookquote">``Amadis of Gaul''  (<font color='red'><b>Garci Ordonez</b></font>)</div>at the beginning of the century.
<p/>For a youth fond of reading, solid or light, there could have been no better spot in Spain than Alcala de Henares in the middle of the sixteenth century.
<p/>It was then a busy, populous university town, something more than the enterprising rival of Salamanca, and altogether a very different place from the melancholy, silent, deserted Alcala
<p/>Theology and medicine may have been the strong points of the university, but the town itself seems to have inclined rather to the humanities and light literature, and as a producer of books Alcala was already beginning to compete with the older presses of Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca and Seville.
<p/>A pendant to the picture Cervantes has given us of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) first playgoings might, no doubt, have been often seen in the streets of Alcala at that time; a bright, eager, tawny-haired boy peering into a book-shop where the latest volumes lay open to tempt the public, wondering, it may be, what that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) boy, that called itself <div class="bookquote">``Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes, segunda impresion,''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>could be about; or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at one of those preposterous portraits of a knight-errant in outrageous panoply and plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances loved to embellish the title-pages of their folios.
<p/>If the boy was the father of the man, the sense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty was lively at ten, and some such reflections as these may have been the true genesis of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote.
<p/>The transition extended to literature. the traveller sees now as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) goes from Madrid to Saragossa. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>For his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) more solid education, we are told, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) went to Salamanca.
<p/>But why Rodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) son to a university a hundred and fifty miles away when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had one at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) own door, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) did so.
<p/>The only evidence is a vague statement by Professor Tomas Gonzalez, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalez</b></font>) once saw an old entry of the matriculation of a Miguel de Cervantes.
<p/>This does not appear to have been ever seen again; but even if it had, and if the date corresponded, it would prove nothing, as there were at least two other Miguels born about the middle of the century; one of them, moreover, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin, no doubt, who was a source of great embarrassment to the biographers.
<p/>No man drew more largely upon experience than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life-for the <div class="bookquote">``Tia Fingida,''  (<font color='red'><b>student</b></font>)</div>if it be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), is not one--nothing, not even <div class="bookquote">``a college joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>student</b></font>)</div>to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered days that most men remember best.
<p/>All that we know positively about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) education is that Juan Lopez de Hoyos, a professor of humanities and belles-lettres of some eminence, calls him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ``dear and beloved pupil.
<p/>This was in a little collection of verses by different hands on the death of Isabel de Valois, second queen of Philip II, published by the professor in 1569, to which Cervantes contributed four pieces, including an elegy, and an epitaph in the form of a sonnet.
<p/>It is only by a rare chance that a <div class="bookquote">``Lycidas''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>finds its way into a volume of this sort, and Cervantes was no Milton.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcala is best proved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) own works. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) verses are no worse than such things usually are; so much, at least, may be said for them.
<p/>By the time the book appeared he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had left Spain, and, as fate ordered it, for twelve years, the most eventful ones of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) life.
<p/>Giulio, afterwards Cardinal, Acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 to Philip II by the Pope on a mission, partly of condolence, partly political, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) return to Rome, which was somewhat brusquely expedited by the King, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) took Cervantes with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) camarero -LRB-chamberlain-RRB-, the office he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) himself held in the Pope's household.
<p/>The post would no doubt have led to advancement at the Papal Court had Cervantes retained it, but in the summer of 1570 he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) resigned it and enlisted as a private soldier in Captain Diego Urbina's company, belonging to Don Miguel de Moncada's regiment, but at that time forming a part of the command of Marc Antony Colonna.
<p/>What impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>) to this step we know not, whether it was distaste for the career before him (<font color='blue'><b>Antony</b></font>), or purely military enthusiasm.
<p/>It may well have been the latter, for it was a stirring time; the events, however, which led to the alliance between Spain, Venice, and the Pope, against the common enemy, the Porte, and to the victory of the combined fleets at Lepanto, belong rather to the history of Europe than to the life of Cervantes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was one of those that sailed from Messina, in September 1571, under the command of Don John of Austria; but on the morning of the 7th of October, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was lying below ill with fever.
<p/>At the news that the enemy was in sight he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) rose, and, in spite of the remonstrances of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) comrades and superiors, insisted on taking his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) post, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) preferred death in the service of God and the King to health.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) galley, the Marquesa, was in the thick of the fight, and before it was over he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had received three gunshot wounds, two in the breast and one in the left hand or arm.
<p/>On the morning after the battle, according to Navarrete, he (<font color='blue'><b>Navarrete</b></font>) had an interview with the commander-in-chief, Don John, who was making a personal inspection of the wounded, one result of which was an addition of three crowns to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pay, and another, apparently, the friendship of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) general.
<p/>How severely Cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact, that with youth, a vigorous frame, and as cheerful and buoyant a temperament as ever invalid had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was seven months in hospital at Messina before he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was discharged.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) came out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) left hand permanently disabled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had lost the use of it, as Mercury told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) in the <div class="bookquote">``Viaje del Parnaso''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>for the greater glory of the right.
<p/>This, however, did not absolutely unfit him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) for service, and in April 1572 he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) joined Manuel Ponce de Leon's company of Lope de Figueroa's regiment, in which, it seems probable, his (<font color='blue'><b>Figueroa</b></font>) brother Rodrigo was serving, and shared in the operations of the next three years, including the capture of the Goletta and Tunis.
<p/>Taking advantage of the lull which followed the recapture of these places by the Turks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodrigo</b></font>) obtained leave to return to Spain, and sailed from Naples in September 1575 on board the Sun galley, in company with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodrigo</b></font>) brother Rodrigo, Pedro Carrillo de Quesada, late Governor of the Goletta, and some others, and furnished with letters from Don John of Austria and the Duke of Sesa, the Viceroy of Sicily, recommending him (<font color='blue'><b>Viceroy</b></font>) to the King for the command of a company, on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) services; a dono infelice as events proved.
<p/>On the 26th they fell in with a squadron of Algerine galleys, and after a stout resistance were overpowered and carried into Algiers.
<p/>By means of a ransomed fellow-captive the brothers contrived to inform their family of their condition, and the poor people at Alcala at once strove to raise the ransom money, the father disposing of all he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) possessed, and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions.
<p/>But Dali Mami had found on Cervantes the letters addressed to the King by Don John and the Duke of Sesa, and, concluding that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) prize must be a person of great consequence, when the money came he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) refused it scornfully as being altogether insufficient.
<p/>The owner of Rodrigo, however, was more easily satisfied; ransom was accepted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodrigo</b></font>) case, and it was arranged between the brothers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodrigo</b></font>) should return to Spain and procure a vessel in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodrigo</b></font>) was to come back to Algiers and take off Miguel and as many of their comrades as possible.
<p/>Soon after the commencement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miguel</b></font>) captivity he (<font color='blue'><b>Miguel</b></font>) induced several of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miguel</b></font>) companions to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Miguel</b></font>) in trying to reach Oran, then a Spanish post, on foot; but after the first day's journey, the Moor who had agreed to act as their guide deserted them, and they had no choice but to return.
<p/>In a garden outside the city on the sea-shore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) constructed, with the help of the gardener, a Spaniard, a hiding-place, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) brought, one by one, fourteen of his (<font color='blue'><b>Spaniard</b></font>) fellow-captives, keeping them there in secrecy for several months, and supplying them with food through a renegade known as El Dorador, <div class="bookquote">``the Gilder.
<p/>This was not the first attempt to escape that Cervantes had made. The second attempt was more disastrous. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a renegade</b></font>)</div>How he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>), a captive himself, contrived to do all this, is one of the mysteries of the story.
<p/>The vessel procured by Rodrigo made its appearance off the coast, and under cover of night was proceeding to take off the refugees, when the crew were alarmed by a passing fishing boat, and beat a hasty retreat.
<p/>On renewing the attempt shortly afterwards, they, or a portion of them at least, were taken prisoners, and just as the poor fellows in the garden were exulting in the thought that in a few moments more freedom would be within their grasp, they found themselves surrounded by Turkish troops, horse and foot.
<p/>Wild as the project may appear, it was very nearly successful. The Dorador had revealed the whole scheme to the Dey Hassan.
<p/>When Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) charged his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) companions to lay all the blame upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>), and as they were being bound he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) declared aloud that the whole plot was of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) contriving, and that nobody else had any share in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was threatened with impalement and with torture; and as cutting off ears and noses were playful freaks with the Algerines, it may be conceived what their tortures were like; but nothing could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) swerve from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) original statement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) alone was responsible.
<p/>The upshot was that the unhappy gardener was hanged by his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) master, and the prisoners taken possession of by the Dey, who, however, afterwards restored most of them to their masters, but kept Cervantes, paying Dali Mami 500 crowns for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) felt, no doubt, that a man of such resource, energy, and daring, was too dangerous a piece of property to be left in private hands; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavily ironed and lodged in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own prison.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that by these means he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could break the spirit or shake the resolution of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prisoner, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was soon undeceived, for Cervantes contrived before long to despatch a letter to the Governor of Oran, entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) some one that could be trusted, to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) and three other gentlemen, fellow-captives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>), to make their escape; intending evidently to renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) first attempt with a more trustworthy guide.
<p/>Unfortunately the Moor who carried the letter was stopped just outside Oran, and the letter being found upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was sent back to Algiers, where by the order of the Dey he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was promptly impaled as a warning to others, while Cervantes was condemned to receive two thousand blows of the stick, a number which most likely would have deprived the world of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>had not some persons, who they were we know not, interceded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) behalf.
<p/>After this he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) seems to have been kept in still closer confinement than before, for nearly two years passed before he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) made another attempt.
<p/>This time his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) plan was to purchase, by the aid of a Spanish renegade and two Valencian merchants resident in Algiers, an armed vessel in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) and about sixty of the leading captives were to make their escape; but just as they were about to put it into execution one Doctor Juan Blanco de Paz, an ecclesiastic and a compatriot, informed the Dey of the plot.
<p/>Cervantes by force of character, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) self-devotion, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) untiring energy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) exertions to lighten the lot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) companions in misery, had endeared himself to all, and become the leading spirit in the captive colony, and, incredible as it may seem, jealousy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) influence and the esteem in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was held, moved this man to compass his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) destruction by a cruel death.
<p/>The merchants finding that the Dey knew all, and fearing that Cervantes under torture might make disclosures that would imperil their own lives, tried to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) to slip away on board a vessel that was on the point of sailing for Spain; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) told them they had nothing to fear, for no tortures would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) compromise anybody, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) went at once and gave himself up to the Dey.
<p/>Everything was made ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) immediate execution; the halter was put round his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) neck and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) hands tied behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>), but all that could be got from him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) himself, with the help of four gentlemen who had since left Algiers, had arranged the whole, and that the sixty who were to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) were not to know anything of it until the last moment.
<p/>Brought before the Dey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) said the same. As before, the Dey tried to force him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) to name his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) accomplices. Finding he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) could make nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>), the Dey sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) back to prison more heavily ironed than before.
<p/>The poverty-stricken Cervantes family had been all this time trying once more to raise the ransom money, and at last a sum of three hundred ducats was got together and entrusted to the Redemptorist Father Juan Gil, who was about to sail for Algiers.
<p/>The Dey, however, demanded more than double the sum offered, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gil</b></font>) term of office had expired and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gil</b></font>) was about to sail for Constantinople, taking all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gil</b></font>) slaves with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gil</b></font>), the case of Cervantes was critical.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was already on board heavily ironed, when the Dey at length agreed to reduce his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) demand by one-half, and Father Gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount, and on September 19, 1580, after a captivity of five years all but a week, Cervantes was at last set free.
<p/>Before long he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) discovered that Blanco de Paz, who claimed to be an officer of the Inquisition, was now concocting on false evidence a charge of misconduct to be brought against him (<font color='blue'><b>Paz</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paz</b></font>) return to Spain.
<p/>To checkmate him (<font color='blue'><b>Paz</b></font>) Cervantes drew up a series of twenty-five questions, covering the whole period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) captivity, upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) requested Father Gil to take the depositions of credible witnesses before a notary.
<p/>Eleven witnesses taken from among the principal captives in Algiers deposed to all the facts above stated and to a great deal more besides.
<p/>There is something touching in the admiration, love, and gratitude we see struggling to find expression in the formal language of the notary, as they testify one after another to the good deeds of Cervantes, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) comforted and helped the weak-hearted, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) kept up their drooping courage, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) poor purse with this deponent, and how ``in him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) this deponent found father and mother.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) return to Spain he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old regiment about to march for Portugal to support Philip's claim to the crown, and utterly penniless now, had no choice but to rejoin it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was in the expeditions to the Azores in 1582 and the following year, and on the conclusion of the war returned to Spain in the autumn of 1583, bringing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) the manuscript of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pastoral romance, the <div class="bookquote">``Galatea,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and probably also, to judge by internal evidence, that of the first portion of ``Persiles and Sigismunda.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) also brought back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) biographers assert, an infant daughter, the offspring of an amour, as some of them with great circumstantiality inform us, with a Lisbon lady of noble birth, whose name, however, as well as that of the street she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lived in, they omit to mention.
<p/>The sole foundation for all this is that in 1605 there certainly was living in the family of Cervantes a Dona Isabel de Saavedra, who is described in an official document as his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) natural daughter, and then twenty years of age.
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless, now that Don John was dead and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had no one to press his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) claims and services, and for a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was a dismal prospect; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had already a certain reputation as a poet; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mind, therefore, to cast his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lot with literature, and for a first venture committed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Galatea''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to the press.
<p/>It was published, as Salva y Mallen shows conclusively, at Alcala, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alcala</b></font>) own birth-place, in 1585 and no doubt helped to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Alcala</b></font>) name more widely known, but certainly did not do him (<font color='blue'><b>Alcala</b></font>) much good in any other way.
<p/>While it was going through the press, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alcala</b></font>) married Dona Catalina de Palacios Salazar y Vozmediano, a lady of Esquivias near Madrid,
<p/>and apparently a friend of the family, who brought him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a fortune which may possibly have served to keep the wolf from the door, but
<p/>The drama had by this time outgrown market-place stages and strolling companies, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) old love for it he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) naturally turned to it for a congenial employment.
<p/>In about three years he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) wrote twenty or thirty plays, which he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) tells us were performed without any throwing of cucumbers or other missiles, and ran their course without any hisses, outcries, or disturbance.
<p/>In other words, his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) plays were not bad enough to be hissed off the stage, but not good enough to hold their own upon it.
<p/>Only two of them have been preserved, but as they happen to be two of the seven or eight he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) mentions with complacency, we may assume they are favourable specimens, and no one who reads the <div class="bookquote">``Numancia''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``Trato de Argel''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>will feel any surprise that they failed as acting dramas.
<p/>'' '' if so, that was all. Whatever merits they may have, whatever occasional they may show, they are, as regards construction, incurably clumsy.
<p/>How completely they failed is manifest from the fact that with all his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) sanguine temperament and indomitable perseverance he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) was unable to maintain the struggle to gain a livelihood as a dramatist for more than three years; nor was the rising popularity of Lope the cause, as is often said, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) own words to the contrary.
<p/>When Lope began to write for the stage is uncertain, but it was certainly after Cervantes went to Seville. Among the <div class="bookquote">``Nuevos Documentos''  (<font color='red'><b>Rodrigo/Rodrigo Osorio</b></font>)</div>printed by Senor Asensio y
<p/>It is an agreement with one Rodrigo Osorio, a manager, who was to accept six comedies at fifty ducats -LRB-about 6l.-RRB-
<p/>apiece, not to be paid in any case unless it appeared on representation that the said comedy was one of the best that had ever been represented in Spain.
<p/>The test does not seem to have been ever applied; perhaps it was sufficiently apparent to Rodrigo Osorio that the comedies were not among the best that had ever been represented.
<p/>Among the correspondence of Cervantes there might have been found, no doubt, more than one letter like that we see in the <div class="bookquote">``Rake's Progress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I have read your play, and it will not doo.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was more successful in a literary contest at Saragossa in 1595 in honour of the canonisation of St. Jacinto, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) composition won the first prize, three silver spoons.
<p/>Toledo is one dated 1592, and curiously characteristic of Cervantes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>The year before this he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had been appointed a collector of revenues for the kingdom of Granada.
<p/>In order to remit the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had collected more conveniently to the treasury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) entrusted it to a merchant, who failed and absconded; and as the bankrupt's assets were insufficient to cover the whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was sent to prison at Seville in September 1597.
<p/>The balance against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>), however, was a small one, about 26l. , and on giving security for it he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was released at the end of the year.
<p/>It was as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) journeyed from town to town collecting the king's taxes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) noted down those bits of inn and wayside life and character that abound in the pages of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote:''  (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div>the Benedictine monks with spectacles and sunshades, mounted on their tall mules; the strollers in costume bound for the next village; the barber with his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) basin on his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) head, on his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) way to bleed a patient; the recruit with his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) breeches in his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) bundle, tramping along the road singing; the reapers gathered in the venta gateway listening to <div class="bookquote">``Felixmarte of Hircania''  (<font color='red'><b>the reapers</b></font>)</div>read out to them; and those little Hogarthian touches that he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) so well knew how to bring in, the ox-tail hanging up with the landlord's comb stuck in it, the wine-skins at the bed-head, and those notable examples of hostelry art, Helen going off in high spirits on Paris's arm, and Dido on the tower dropping tears as big as walnuts.
<p/>Nay, it may well be that on those journeys into remote regions he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) came across now and then a specimen of the pauper gentleman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) lean hack and his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) greyhound and his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) books of chivalry, dreaming away his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) life in happy ignorance that the world had changed since his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) great-grandfather's old helmet was new.
<p/>But it was in Seville that he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) found out his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) true vocation, though he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) himself would not by any means have admitted it to be so.
<p/>It was there, in Triana, that he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) was first tempted to try his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) hand at drawing from life, and first brought his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) humour into play in the exquisite little sketch of <div class="bookquote">``Rinconete y Cortadillo,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the germ, in more ways than one, of ``Don Quixote.
<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) imprisonment all trace of Cervantes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) official capacity disappears, from which it may be inferred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) was not reinstated.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) was still in Seville in November 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) on the elaborate catafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at the death of Philip II, but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to his (<font color='blue'><b>II</b></font>) movements.
<p/>The words in the preface to the First Part of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>are generally held to be conclusive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) conceived the idea of the book, and wrote the beginning of it at least, in a prison, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) may have done so is extremely likely.
<p/>There is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) work to a select audience at the Duke of Bejar's, which may have helped to make the book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duke</b></font>)</div>lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) hands some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) could find a publisher bold enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character; and so little faith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) sold it, Aragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that for Castile.
<p/>'' Where and when that was written, we cannot tell. The printing was finished in December, and the book came out with the new year, 1605.
<p/>No sooner was it in the hands of the public than preparations were made to issue pirated editions at Lisbon and Valencia, and to bring out a second edition with the February.
<p/>It is often said that <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was at first received coldly. The facts show just the contrary. No doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certain sections of the community.
<p/>Men of wit, taste, and discrimination among the aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome, but the aristocracy in general were not likely to relish a book that turned their favourite reading into ridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas.
<p/>The dramatists who gathered round Lope as their leader regarded Cervantes as their common enemy, and it is plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was equally obnoxious to the other clique, the culto poets who had Gongora for their chief.
<p/>Navarrete, who knew nothing of the letter above mentioned, tries hard to show that the relations between Cervantes and Lope were of a very friendly sort, as indeed they were until <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>was written.
<p/>Cervantes, indeed, to the last generously and manfully declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) admiration of Lope's powers, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) unfailing invention, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) marvellous fertility; but in the preface of the First Part of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Lope/Lope de Vega</b></font>)</div>and in the verses of <div class="bookquote">``Urganda the Unknown,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lope/Lope de Vega</b></font>)</div>and one or two other places, there are, if we read between the lines, sly hits at Lope's vanities and affectations that argue no personal good-will; and Lope openly sneers at <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Lope/Lope de Vega</b></font>)</div>and Cervantes, and fourteen years after his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) death gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) only a few lines of cold commonplace in the <div class="bookquote">``Laurel de Apolo,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that seem all the colder for the eulogies of a host of nonentities whose names are found nowhere else.
<p/>In 1601 Valladolid was made the seat of the Court, and at the beginning of 1603 Cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with the balance due by him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) to the Treasury, which was still outstanding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) remained at Valladolid, apparently supporting himself by agencies and scrivener's work of some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawing up statements of claims to be presented to the Council, and the like.
<p/>So, at least, we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion of the death of a gentleman, the victim of a street brawl, who had been carried into the house in which he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) lived.
<p/>In these he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) himself is described as a man who wrote and transacted business, and it appears that his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) household then consisted of his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) wife, the natural daughter Isabel de Saavedra already mentioned, his (<font color='blue'><b>Saavedra</b></font>) sister Andrea, now a widow, her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrea</b></font>) daughter Constanza, a mysterious Magdalena de Sotomayor calling herself his (<font color='blue'><b>Saavedra</b></font>) sister, for whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Saavedra</b></font>) biographers cannot account, and a servant-maid.
<p/>Meanwhile <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>author</b></font>)</div>had been growing in favour, and its author's name was now known beyond the Pyrenees. In 1607 an edition was printed at Brussels.
<p/>Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet the demand by a third edition, the seventh in all, in 1608.
<p/>The popularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller was led to bring out an edition in 1610; and another was called for in Brussels in 1611.
<p/>It might naturally have been expected that, with such proofs before him (<font color='blue'><b>Robles</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robles</b></font>) had hit the taste of the public, Cervantes would have at once set about redeeming his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) rather vague promise of a second volume.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had still by him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had inserted in <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and instead of continuing the adventures of Don Quixote, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) set to work to write more of these <div class="bookquote">``Novelas Exemplares''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) afterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.
<p/>The novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication to the Conde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of those chatty confidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of.
<p/>In this, eight years and a half after the First Part of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had appeared, we get the first hint of a forthcoming Second Part.
<p/>But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) thoughts. '' You shall see shortly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) says, ``the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) idea of <div class="bookquote">``shortly''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>was a somewhat elastic one, for, as we know by the date to Sancho's letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had barely one-half of the book completed that time twelvemonth.
<p/>The same indomitable spirit that kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) from despair in the bagnios of Algiers, and prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to attempt the escape of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) comrades again and again, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) persevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) efforts to win the ear of the public as a dramatist.
<p/>'' But more than poems, or pastorals, or novels, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) dramatic ambition that engrossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thoughts. The temperament of Cervantes was essentially sanguine.
<p/>The portrait he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) draws in the preface to the novels, with the aquiline features, chestnut hair, smooth untroubled forehead, and bright cheerful eyes, is the very portrait of a sanguine man.
<p/>Nothing that the managers might say could persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the merits of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plays would not be recognised at last if they were only given a fair chance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to found a great national drama, based on the true principles of art, that was to be the envy of all nations; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to drive from the stage the silly, childish plays, the <div class="bookquote">``mirrors of nonsense and models of folly''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that were in vogue through the cupidity of the managers and shortsightedness of the authors; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to correct and educate the public taste until it was ripe for tragedies on the model of the Greek drama--like the <div class="bookquote">``Numancia''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for instance--and comedies that would not only amuse but improve and instruct.
<p/>The old soldier of the Spanish Salamis was bent on being the Aeschylus of Spain. All this he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was to do, could he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) once get a hearing: there was the initial difficulty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) shows plainly enough, too, that <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and the demolition of the chivalry romances was not the work that lay next his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) was, indeed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) says himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) preface, more a stepfather than a father to <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a father</b></font>)</div>Never was great work so neglected by its author.
<p/>That it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits and starts, was not always his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) fault, but it seems clear he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) never read what he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) sent to the press.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) knew how the printers had blundered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) never took the trouble to correct them when the third edition was in progress, as a man who really cared for the child of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain would have done.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appears to have regarded the book as little more than a mere libro de entretenimiento, an amusing book, a thing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says in the <div class="bookquote">``Viaje,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``to divert the melancholy moody heart at any time or season.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had an affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hero, and was very proud of Sancho Panza. It would have been strange indeed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) had not been proud of the most humorous creation in all fiction.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was proud, too, of the popularity and success of the book, and beyond measure delightful is the naivete with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) shows his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) pride in a dozen passages in the Second Part.
<p/>In all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) would have given all the success of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>nay, would have seen every copy of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>burned in the Plaza Mayor, for one such success as Lope de Vega was enjoying on an average once a week.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) went on, dawdling over <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>adding a chapter now and again, and putting it aside to turn to <div class="bookquote">``Persiles and Sigismunda'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--which, as we know, was to be the most entertaining book in the language, and the rival of <div class="bookquote">``Theagenes and Chariclea'' (<font color='red'><b>the rival</b></font>)</div>--or finishing off one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) darling comedies; and if Robles asked when <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Robles</b></font>)</div>would be ready, the answer no doubt was: En breve-shortly, there was time enough for that.
<p/>But it was not the success he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) coveted. At sixty-eight he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) was as full of life and hope and plans for the future as a boy of eighteen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had got as far as Chapter LIX, which at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) leisurely pace he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could hardly have reached before October or November 1614, when there was put into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand a small octave lately printed at Tarragona, and calling itself ``Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha:
<p/>The last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of the Second Part give us some idea of the effect produced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) irritation was not likely to be lessened by the reflection that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had no one to blame but himself.
<p/>Had Avellaneda, in fact, been content with merely bringing out a continuation to <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Avellaneda</b></font>)</div>Cervantes would have had no reasonable grievance.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) own intentions were expressed in the very vaguest language at the end of the book; nay, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) last words, <div class="bookquote">``forse altro cantera con miglior plettro,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) seems actually to invite some one else to continue the work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) made no sign until eight years and a half had gone by; by which time Avellaneda's volume was no doubt written.
<p/>Nemesis was coming, however. by the Licentiate Alonso Fernandez de Avellaneda of Tordesillas. '' In fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the mere continuation was concerned.
<p/>But Avellaneda chose to write a preface to it, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned man could pour out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless, accuses him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of envy of Lope's success, of petulance and querulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay.
<p/>Whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have been, it is clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was one of the dramatists of Lope's school, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has the impudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) as well as Lope in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) criticism on the drama.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) identification has exercised the best critics and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it.
<p/>Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was; but I must say I think the anger he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) shows suggests an invisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in the dark.
<p/>Cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself, supports this view and believes him (<font color='blue'><b>Pellicer</b></font>), moreover, to have been an ecclesiastic, a Dominican probably.
<p/>Avellaneda's reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) is too dull to reflect much.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) is, at best, a poor plagiarist; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) by Cervantes;
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns for castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage, and Sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gluttony; all through he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) has contrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth century novellieri and without their sprightliness.
<p/>'' Dull and dirty'' will always be, I imagine, the verdict of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. But whatever Avellaneda and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) book may be, we must not forget the debt we owe them.
<p/>But for them, there can be no doubt, <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>would have come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work.
<p/>Even if Cervantes had finished the volume he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had in hand, most assuredly he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) would have left off with a promise of a Third Part, giving the further adventures of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds.
<p/>It is plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) had at one time an intention of dealing with the pastoral romances as he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) had dealt with the books of chivalry, and but for Avellaneda he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) would have tried to carry it out.
<p/>But it is more likely that, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) plans, and projects, and hopefulness, the volume would have remained unfinished till his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) death, and that we should have never made the acquaintance of the Duke and Duchess, or gone with Sancho to Barataria.
<p/>From the moment the book came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seems to have been haunted by the fear that there might be more Avellanedas in the field, and putting everything else aside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) set himself to finish off his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) task and protect Don Quixote in the only way he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could, by killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>The conclusion is no doubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece of work and the frequent repetition of the scolding administered to Avellaneda becomes in the end rather wearisome; but it is, at any rate, a conclusion and
<p/>The new volume was ready for the press in February, but was not printed till the very end of 1615, and during the interval Cervantes put together the comedies and interludes he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had written within the last few years, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) adds plaintively, found no demand for among the managers, and published them with a preface, worth the book it introduces tenfold, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) gives an account of the early Spanish stage, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) own attempts as a dramatist.
<p/>It is needless to say they were put forward by Cervantes in all good faith and full confidence in their merits.
<p/>The reader, however, was not to suppose they were his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) last word or final effort in the drama, for he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had in hand a comedy called <div class="bookquote">``Engano a los ojos,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>about which, if he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) mistook not, there would be no question.
<p/>Of this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging; his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) health had been failing for some time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) died, apparently of dropsy, on the 23rd of April, 1616, the day on which England lost Shakespeare, nominally at least, for the English calendar had not yet been reformed.
<p/>for that we must thank Avellaneda. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) died as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had lived, accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) lot bravely and cheerfully. Was it an unhappy life, that of Cervantes?
<p/>It was a hard life, a life of poverty, of incessant struggle, of toil ill paid, of disappointment, but Cervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was not one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely by virtue of their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a high spirit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was proof against it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) biographers all tell us that it was; but I must say I doubt it. It is impossible to conceive Cervantes giving way to despondency or prostrated by dejection.
<p/>As for poverty, it was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) a thing to be laughed over, and the only sigh he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) ever allows to escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) is when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) says, <div class="bookquote">``Happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) to whom Heaven has given a piece of bread for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) is not bound to give thanks to any but Heaven itself.
<p/>Add to all this his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) vital energy and mental activity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) restless invention and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) sanguine temperament, and there will be reason enough to doubt whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) could have been a very unhappy life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) who could take Cervantes' distresses together with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) apparatus for enduring them would not make so bad a bargain, perhaps, as far as happiness in life is concerned.
<p/>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) burial-place nothing is known except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was buried, in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) will, in the neighbouring convent of Trinitarian nuns, of which it is supposed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) daughter, Isabel de Saavedra, was an inmate, and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to another convent, carrying their dead with them.
<p/>But whether the remains of Cervantes were included in the removal or not no one knows, and the clue to their resting-place is now lost beyond all hope.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This furnishes perhaps the least defensible of the items in the charge of neglect brought against his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) contemporaries. In some of the others there is a good deal of exaggeration.
<p/>To listen to most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) biographers one would suppose that all Spain was in league not only against the man but against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory, or at least that it was insensible to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) merits, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to live in misery and die of want.
<p/>To talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hard life and unworthy employments in Andalusia is absurd. What had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) done to distinguish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from thousands of other struggling men earning a precarious livelihood?
<p/>True, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a gallant soldier, who had been wounded and had undergone captivity and suffering in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country's cause, but there were hundreds of others in the same case.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had written a mediocre specimen of an insipid class of romance, and some plays which manifestly did not comply with the primary condition of pleasing: were the playgoers to patronise plays that did not amuse them, because the author was to produce <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>twenty years afterwards?
<p/>The scramble for copies which, as we have seen, followed immediately on the appearance of the book, does not look like general insensibility to its merits.
<p/>No doubt it was received coldly by some, but if a man writes a book in ridicule of periwigs he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) account with being coldly received by the periwig wearers and hated by the whole tribe of wigmakers.
<p/>If Cervantes had the chivalry-romance readers, the sentimentalists, the dramatists, and the poets of the period all against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>), it was because <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>was what it was; and if the general public did not come forward to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) comfortable for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) days, it is no more to be charged with neglect and ingratitude than the English-speaking public that did not pay off Scott's liabilities.
<p/>It did the best it could; it read his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) book and liked it and bought it, and encouraged the bookseller to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) well for others.
<p/>It has been also made a reproach to Spain that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has erected no monument to the man she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for the bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de las Cortes, a fair work of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it been set up to the local poet in the market-place of some provincial town, is not worthy of Cervantes or of Madrid.
<p/>But what need has Cervantes of <div class="bookquote">``such weak witness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) name;''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>or what could a monument do in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) case except testify to the self-glorification of those who had put it up?
<p/>Si monumentum quoeris, circumspice. The nearest bookseller's shop will show what bathos there would be in a monument to the author of ``Don Quixote.
<p/>Nine editions of the First Part of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>had already appeared before Cervantes died, thirty thousand copies in all, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) own estimate, and a tenth was printed at Barcelona the year after his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) death.
<p/>So large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time, but by 1634 it appears to have been exhausted; and from that time down to the present day the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidly and regularly.
<p/>'' The translations show still more clearly in what request the book has been from the very outset. In seven years from the completion of the work it had been translated into the four leading languages of Europe.
<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``Imitatio Christi''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>may have been translated into as many different languages, and perhaps <div class="bookquote">``Robinson Crusoe''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``Vicar of Wakefield''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>into nearly as many, but in multiplicity of translations and editions <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>leaves them all far behind.
<p/>Except the Bible, in fact, no book has been so widely diffused as <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the character</b></font>)</div>Still more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion.
<p/>Don Quixote'' has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas about knight-errantry, if they had any at all, were of the vaguest, who had never seen or heard of a book of chivalry, who could not possibly feel the humour of the burlesque or sympathise with the author's purpose.
<p/>'' Another curious fact is that this, the most cosmopolitan book in the world, is one of the most intensely national.
<p/>Manon Lescaut'' is not more thoroughly French, <div class="bookquote">``Tom Jones''  (<font color='red'><b>Manon</b></font>)</div>not more English, <div class="bookquote">``Rob Roy''  (<font color='red'><b>Manon</b></font>)</div>not more Scotch, than <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Roy Scotch</b></font>)</div>is Spanish, in character, in ideas, in sentiment, in local colour, in everything.
<p/>'' What, then, is the secret of this unparalleled popularity, increasing year by year for well-nigh three centuries? One explanation, no doubt, is that of all the books in the world, <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is the most catholic.
<p/>As Cervantes himself says with a touch of pride, ``It is thumbed and read and got by heart by people of all sorts; the children turn its leaves, the young people read it
<p/>There is something in it for every sort of reader, young or old, sage or simple, high or low. , the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it.
<p/>But it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which, more than its humour, or its wisdom, or the fertility of invention or knowledge of human nature it displays, has insured its success with the multitude, is the vein of farce that runs through it.
<p/>It was the attack upon the sheep, the battle with the wine-skins, Mambrino's helmet, the balsam of Fierabras, Don Quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill, Sancho tossed in the blanket, the mishaps and misadventures of master and man, that were originally the great attraction, and perhaps are so still to some extent with the majority of readers.
<p/>It is plain that <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div>was generally regarded at first, and indeed in Spain for a long time, as little more than a queer droll book, full of laughable incidents and absurd situations, very amusing, but not entitled to much consideration or care.
<p/>All the editions printed in Spain from 1637 to 1771, when the famous printer Ibarra took it up, were mere trade editions, badly and carelessly printed on vile paper and got up in the style of chap-books intended only for popular use, with, in most instances, uncouth illustrations and clap-trap additions by the publisher.
<p/>To England belongs the credit of having been the first country to recognise the right of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to better treatment than this.
<p/>The London edition of 1738, commonly called Lord Carteret's from having been suggested by him (<font color='blue'><b>Carteret</b></font>), was not a mere edition de luxe.
<p/>It produced <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>in becoming form as regards paper and type, and embellished with plates which, if not particularly happy as illustrations, were at least well intentioned and well executed, but it also aimed at correctness of text, a matter to which nobody except the editors of the Valencia and Brussels editions had given even a passing thought; and for a first attempt it was fairly successful, for though some of its emendations are inadmissible, a good many of them have been adopted by all subsequent editors.
<p/>'' The zeal of publishers, editors, and annotators brought about a remarkable change of sentiment with regard to <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>annotators</b></font>)</div><p/>A vast number of its admirers began to grow ashamed of laughing over it. It became almost a crime to treat it as a humorous book.
<p/>The humour was not entirely denied, but, according to the new view, it was rated as an altogether secondary quality, a mere accessory, nothing more than the stalking-horse under the presentation of which Cervantes shot his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) philosophy or his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) satire, or whatever it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) meant to shoot; for on this point opinions varied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) said emphatically in the preface to the First Part and in the last sentence of the Second, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had no other object in view than to discredit these books, and this, to advanced criticism, made it clear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) object must have been something else.
<p/>One theory was that the book was a kind of allegory, setting forth the eternal struggle between the ideal and the real, between the spirit of poetry and the spirit of prose; and perhaps German philosophy never evolved a more ungainly or unlikely camel out of the depths of its inner consciousness.
<p/>Something of the antagonism, no doubt, is to be found in <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>because it is to be found everywhere in life, and Cervantes drew from life.
<p/>It is difficult to imagine a community in which the never-ceasing game of cross-purposes between Sancho Panza and Don Quixote would not be recognized as true to nature.
<p/>In the stone age, among the lake dwellers, among the cave men, there were Don Quixotes and Sancho Panzas; there must have been the troglodyte who never could see the facts before his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixotes</b></font>) eyes, and the troglodyte who could see nothing else.
<p/>But to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such idea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very unlike the age in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) lived, but altogether unlike Cervantes himself, who would have been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyone else.
<p/>The extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) day is quite enough to account for the genesis of the book.
<p/>Some idea of the prodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth century may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the reader bears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the largest group are enumerated.
<p/>All were agreed, however, that the object he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) aimed at was not the books of chivalry. As to its effect upon the nation, there is abundant evidence.
<p/>From the time when the Amadises and Palmerins began to grow popular down to the very end of the century, there is a steady stream of invective, from men whose character and position lend weight to their words, against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of their readers.
<p/>That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) had ample provocation to urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) to it, will be sufficiently clear to those who look into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry itself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) attacked and swept away.
<p/>Of all the absurdities that, thanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no greater one than saying that <div class="bookquote">``Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away.
<p/>Ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>In the first place there was no chivalry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) to smile away.
<p/>Its work was done when Granada fell, and as chivalry was essentially republican in its nature, it could not live under the rule that Ferdinand substituted for the free institutions of mediaeval Spain.
<p/>Spain's chivalry had been dead for more than a century. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferdinand</b></font>) did smile away was not chivalry but a degrading mockery of it.
<p/>The true nature of the <div class="bookquote">``right arm''  (<font color='red'><b>the poet</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``bright array,''  (<font color='red'><b>the poet</b></font>)</div>before which, according to the poet, <div class="bookquote">``the world gave ground,''  (<font color='red'><b>the poet</b></font>)</div>and which Cervantes' single laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) own countrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by Captain George Carleton, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Military Memoirs from 1672 to 1713.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George</b></font>)</div><p/>Before the appearance in the world of that labour of Cervantes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it was next to an impossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or without danger.
<p/>There were seen so many cavaliers prancing and curvetting before the windows of their mistresses, that a stranger would have imagined the whole nation to have been nothing less than a race of knight-errants.
<p/>But after the world became a little acquainted with that notable history, the man that was seen in that once celebrated drapery was pointed at as a Don Quixote, and found himself the jest of high and low.
<p/>And I verily believe that to this, and this only, we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit which has run through all our councils for a century past, so little agreeable to those nobler actions of our famous ancestors.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' To call <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>pessimist</b></font>)</div>a sad book, preaching a pessimist view of life, argues a total misconception of its drift.
<p/>But it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral, so far as it can be said to have one, is that the spurious enthusiasm that is born of vanity and self-conceit, that is made an end in itself, not a means to an end, that acts on mere impulse, regardless of circumstances and consequences, is mischievous to its owner, and a very considerable nuisance to the community at large.
<p/>To those who cannot distinguish between the one kind and the other, no doubt <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>is a sad book; no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had just uttered so beautiful a sentiment as that <div class="bookquote">``it is a hard case to make slaves of those whom God and Nature made free,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>should be ungratefully pelted by the scoundrels his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) crazy philanthropy had let loose on society; but to others of a more judicial cast it will be a matter of regret that reckless self-sufficient enthusiasm is not oftener requited in some such way for all the mischief it does in the world.
<p/>A very slight examination of the structure of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>will suffice to show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) began the book.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) wrote those lines in which <div class="bookquote">``with a few strokes of a great master he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sets before us the pauper gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had no idea of the goal to which his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) imagination was leading him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>There can be little doubt that all he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) contemplated was a short tale to range with those he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had already written, a tale setting forth the ludicrous results that might be expected to follow the attempt of a crazy gentleman to act the part of a knight-errant in modern life.
<p/>It is plain, for one thing, that Sancho Panza did not enter into the original scheme, for had Cervantes thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) certainly would not have omitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) hero's outfit, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) obviously meant to be complete.
<p/>It would be so if its moral were that, in this world, true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridicule and discomfiture. Him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) we owe to the landlord's chance remark in Chapter III that knights seldom travelled without squires.
<p/>To try to think of a Don Quixote without Sancho Panza is like trying to think of a one-bladed pair of scissors.
<p/>The story was written at first, like the others, without any division and without the intervention of Cide Hamete Benengeli; and it seems not unlikely that Cervantes had some intention of bringing Dulcinea, or Aldonza Lorenzo, on the scene in person.
<p/>It was probably the ransacking of the Don's library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that first suggested it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) idea was capable of development.
<p/>What, if instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) were to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) tale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing their style, incidents, and spirit?
<p/>In pursuance of this change of plan, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) hastily and somewhat clumsily divided what he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) had written into chapters on the model of <div class="bookquote">``Amadis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>invented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up Cide Hamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of the chivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to some recondite source.
<p/>Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho's part, but to the whole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) announces his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) intention of taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>About the ass,'' we are told, <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) an esquire mounted on ass-back; but no instance occurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) memory.
<p/>We can see the whole scene at a glance, the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and the perplexity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, upon whose perception the incongruity has just forced itself.
<p/>This is Sancho's mission throughout the book; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is an unconscious Mephistopheles, always unwittingly making mockery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's aspirations, always exposing the fallacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ideas by some unintentional ad absurdum, always bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) back to the world of fact and commonplace by force of sheer stolidity.
<p/>By the time Cervantes had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) volume of novels off his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) hands, and summoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest, the case was very much altered.
<p/>Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had not merely found favour, but had already become, what they have never since ceased to be, veritable entities to the popular imagination.
<p/>There was no occasion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) readers told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) plainly that what they wanted of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was more Don Quixote and more Sancho Panza, and not novels, tales, or digressions.
<p/>In working out the new ideas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) soon found the value of Sancho Panza. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' To himself, too, his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) creations had become realities, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) had become proud of them, especially of Sancho.
<p/>Even in translation the style will be seen to be far easier, more flowing, more natural, and more like that of a man sure of himself and of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) audience.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began the Second Part, therefore, under very different conditions, and the difference makes itself manifest at once. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo a change also.
<p/>In the First Part, Don Quixote has no character or individuality whatever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is nothing more than a crazy representative of the sentiments of the chivalry romances.
<p/>In all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) says and does he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is simply repeating the lesson he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has learned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) books; and therefore, it is absurd to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the gushing strain of the sentimental critics when they dilate upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) nobleness, disinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so forth.
<p/>It was the business of a knight-errant to right wrongs, redress injuries, and succour the distressed, and this, as a matter of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) business when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) takes up the part; a knight-errant was bound to be intrepid, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feels bound to cast fear aside.
<p/>Of all Byron's melodious nonsense about Don Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is that '''t is his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) virtue makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mad!
<p/>In the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if it was a point upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) was anxious there should be no mistake, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) hero's madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject of chivalry, and that on every other subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) is discreto, one, in fact, whose faculty of discernment is in perfect order.
<p/>The advantage of this is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himself the relief of digression when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) requires it, as freely as in a commonplace book.
<p/>'' The exact opposite is the truth; it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) madness makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) virtuous. It is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is not very great.
<p/>There are some natural touches of character about him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), such as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mixture of irascibility and placability, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) curious affection for Sancho together with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) impatience of the squire's loquacity and impertinence; but in the main, apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) craze, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is little more than a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctive good taste and a great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind.
<p/>As to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface to the First Part, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was a favourite with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) creator even before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had been taken into favour by the public.
<p/>An inferior genius, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) in hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) by making him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous.
<p/>Sancho, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) reappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with a difference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the same time with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outline has been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by a few touches of a master's hand, Sancho stands before us as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might in a character portrait by Velazquez.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Velazquez</b></font>) is a much more important and prominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Velazquez</b></font>) matchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent supplies the action of the story.
<p/>But Cervantes was too true an artist to spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) work in this way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) lies are not of the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in; like Falstaff's, they resemble the father that begets them; they are simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short.
<p/>But in the service of such a master as Don Quixote he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) develops rapidly, as we see when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) ladies in waiting.
<p/>It is worth noticing how, flushed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) success in this instance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) powers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) account of the journey on Clavileno.
<p/>In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the chivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque.
<p/>Enchantments of the sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave of Montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances, and another distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote's blind adoration of Dulcinea.
<p/>In the First Part he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) displays a great natural gift of lying. In the romances of chivalry love is either a mere animalism or a fantastic idolatry.
<p/>Only a coarse-minded man would care to make merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes' humour the latter was naturally an attractive subject for ridicule.
<p/>Like everything else in these romances, it is a gross exaggeration of the real sentiment of chivalry, but its peculiar extravagance is probably due to the influence of those masters of hyperbole, the Provencal poets.
<p/>When a troubadour professed his (<font color='blue'><b>troubadour</b></font>) readiness to obey his (<font color='blue'><b>troubadour</b></font>) lady in all things, he (<font color='blue'><b>troubadour</b></font>) made it incumbent upon the next comer, if he (<font color='blue'><b>troubadour</b></font>) wished to avoid the imputation of tameness and commonplace, to declare himself the slave of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will, which the next was compelled to cap by some still stronger declaration; and so expressions of devotion went on rising one above the other like biddings at an auction, and a conventional language of gallantry and theory of love came into being that in time permeated the literature of Southern Europe, and bore fruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of Beatrice and Laura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found exponents in writers like Feliciano de Silva.
<p/>This is what Cervantes deals with in Don Quixote's passion for Dulcinea, and in no instance has he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) carried out the burlesque more happily.
<p/>By keeping Dulcinea in the background, and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) a vague shadowy being of whose very existence we are left in doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) invests Don Quixote's worship of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) virtues and charms with an additional extravagance, and gives still more point to the caricature of the sentiment and language of the romances.
<p/>One of the great merits of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>readers</b></font>)</div>and one of the qualities that have secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it the most cosmopolitan of books, is its simplicity.
<p/>There are, of course, points obvious enough to a Spanish seventeenth century audience which do not immediately strike a reader now-a-days, and Cervantes often takes it for granted that an allusion will be generally understood which is only intelligible to a few.
<p/>For example, on many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) readers in Spain, and most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) readers out of it, the significance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) choice of a country for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) hero is completely lost.
<p/>It would be going too far to say that no one can thoroughly comprehend <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>without having seen La Mancha, but undoubtedly even a glimpse of La Mancha will give an insight into the meaning of Cervantes such as no commentator can give.
<p/>Of all the regions of Spain it is the last that would suggest the idea of romance. Of all the dull central plateau of the Peninsula it is the dullest tract.
<p/>There is something impressive about the grim solitudes of Estremadura; and if the plains of Leon and Old Castile are bald and dreary, they are studded with old cities renowned in history and rich in relics of the past.
<p/>But there is no redeeming feature in the Manchegan landscape; it has all the sameness of the desert without its dignity; the few towns and villages that break its monotony are mean and commonplace, there is nothing venerable about them, they have not even the picturesqueness of poverty; indeed, Don Quixote's own village, Argamasilla, has a sort of oppressive respectability in the prim regularity of its streets and houses; everything is ignoble; the very windmills are the ugliest and shabbiest of the windmill kind.
<p/>To anyone who knew the country well, the mere style and title of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote of La Mancha''  (<font color='red'><b>anyone</b></font>)</div>gave the key to the author's meaning at once.
<p/>La Mancha as the knight's country and scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) chivalries is of a piece with the pasteboard helmet, the farm-labourer on ass-back for a squire, knighthood conferred by a rascally ventero, convicts taken for victims of oppression, and the rest of the incongruities between Don Quixote's world and the world he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lived in, between things as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw them and things as they were.
<p/>It is strange that this element of incongruity, underlying the whole humour and purpose of the book, should have been so little heeded by the majority of those who have undertaken to interpret <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the majority</b></font>)</div>It has been completely overlooked, for example, by the illustrators. To be sure, the great majority of the artists who illustrated <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>the artists</b></font>)</div>knew nothing whatever of Spain.
<p/>To them a venta conveyed no idea but the abstract one of a roadside inn, and they could not therefore do full justice to the humour of Don Quixote's misconception in taking it for a castle, or perceive the remoteness of all its realities from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ideal.
<p/>But even when better informed they seem to have no apprehension of the full force of the discrepancy. Take, for instance, Gustave Dore's drawing of Don Quixote watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour in the inn-yard.
<p/>Whether or not the Venta de Quesada on the Seville road is, as tradition maintains, the inn described in <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes/Miguel de Cervantes/Miguel</b></font>)</div>beyond all question it was just such an inn-yard as the one behind it that Cervantes had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) mind's eye, and it was on just such a rude stone trough as that beside the primitive draw-well in the corner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) meant Don Quixote to deposit his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour.
<p/>Gustave Dore makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and thereby entirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes.
<p/>It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote's vigil and the ceremony that follows.
<p/>Cervantes' humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous.
<p/>It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction.
<p/>That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, <div class="bookquote">``Cervantes' serious air,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cervantes the master</b></font>)</div>which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) interpreters.
<p/>Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux's version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt.
<p/>It is the grave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) is saying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes.
<p/>Even when Uncle Toby is at his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) best, you are always aware of <div class="bookquote">``the man Sterne''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle Toby</b></font>)</div>behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sterne</b></font>), watching you over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sterne</b></font>) shoulder to see what effect he (<font color='blue'><b>Sterne</b></font>) is producing.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Sterne</b></font>), in fact, is the exact opposite of the humour of Sterne and the self-conscious humourists. Cervantes always leaves you alone with Don Quixote and Sancho.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) and Swift and the great humourists always keep themselves out of sight, or, more properly speaking, never think about themselves at all, unlike our latter-day school of humourists, who seem to have revived the old horse-collar method, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque assumption of ignorance, imbecility, or bad taste.
<p/>There is a natural gravity and a sonorous stateliness about Spanish, be it ever so colloquial, that make an absurdity doubly absurd, and give plausibility to the most preposterous statement.
<p/>It is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any other language is well-nigh an impossibility. This is what makes Sancho Panza's drollery the despair of the conscientious translator.
<p/>Sancho's curt comments can never fall flat, but they lose half their flavour when transferred from their native Castilian into any other medium.
<p/>But if foreigners have failed to do justice to the humour of Cervantes, they are no worse than his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) own countrymen.
<p/>Indeed, were it not for the Spanish peasant's relish of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div>one might be tempted to think that the great humourist was not looked upon as a humourist at all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) own country.
<p/>The craze of Don Quixote seems, in some instances, to have communicated itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) critics, making them see things that are not in the book and run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their own imaginations.
<p/>Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget that screams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that are influenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, and pompous epithets.
<p/>But what strikes one as particularly strange is that while they deal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner of imaginary ideas and qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception of the quality that ninety-nine out of a hundred of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) readers would rate highest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>), and hold to be the one that raises him (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) above all rivalry.
<p/>Cervantes at times makes it a kind of commonplace book for occasional essays and criticisms, or for the observations and reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirring life.
<p/>To speak of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as if it were merely a humorous book would be a manifest misdescription. It is a mine of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature.
<p/>Among modern novels there may be, here and there, more elaborate studies of character, but there is no book richer in individualised character.
<p/>What Coleridge said of Shakespeare in minimis is true of Cervantes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) never, even for the most temporary purpose, puts forward a lay figure.
<p/>There is life and individuality in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) characters, however little they may have to do, or however short a time they may be before the reader.
<p/>Samson Carrasco, the curate, Teresa Panza, Altisidora, even the two students met on the road to the cave of Montesinos, all live and move and have their being; and it is characteristic of the broad humanity of Cervantes that there is not a hateful one among them all.
<p/>Even poor Maritornes, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) deplorable morals, has a kind heart of her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) own and <div class="bookquote">``some faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>);''  (<font color='red'><b>Maritornes</b></font>)</div>and as for Sancho, though on dissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), unless it be a sort of dog-like affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, who is there that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart does not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>)?
<p/>But it is, after all, the humour of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>that distinguishes it from all other books of the romance kind.
<p/>It is this that makes it, as one of the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, <div class="bookquote">``the best novel in the world beyond all comparison.
<p/>It is its varied humour, ranging from broad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare's or Moliere's that has naturalised it in every country where there are readers, and made it a classic in every language that has a literature.

<p/>No longer now doth proud knight-errantry Regard with scorn the sickle and the spade; Of towering arrogance less count is made Than of plain esquire-like simplicity.
<p/>I envy thee thy Dapple, and thy name, And those alforjas thou wast wont to stuff With comforts that thy providence proclaim.
<p/>All hail, illustrious man! Excellent Sancho! hail to thee again! To thee alone the Ovid of our Spain Does homage with the rustic kiss and cuff.

<p/>I cannot be thy rival, for thy fame And prowess rise above all rivalry, Albeit both bereft of wits we go.
<p/>But, though the Scythian or the Moor to tame Was not thy lot, still thou dost rival me: Love binds us in a fellowship of woe.
<p/>My sword was not to be compared with thine Phoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy, Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mine That smote from east to west as lightnings fly.
<p/>THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUS To Don Quixote of La Mancha I scorned all empire, and that monarchy The rosy east held out
<p/>did I resign For one glance of Claridiana's eye, The bright Aurora for whose love I pine. A miracle of constancy my love; And banished by her (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) ruthless cruelty
<p/>But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove, For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name, And famous, honoured, wise, she (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>) lives in thee.
<p/>Your fantasies, Sir Quixote, it is true, That crazy brain of yours have quite upset, But aught of base or mean hath never yet Been charged by any in reproach to you.
<p/>Your deeds are open proof in all men's view; For you went forth injustice to abate, And for your pains sore drubbings did you get From many a rascally and ruffian crew.

<p/>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE Idle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would this book, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest, and cleverest that could be imagined.
<p/>But I could not counteract Nature's law that everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could this sterile, illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry, shrivelled, whimsical offspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came into any other imagination--just what might be begotten in a prison, where every misery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling?
<p/>Tranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, bright skies, murmuring brooks, peace of mind, these are the things that go far to make even the most barren muses fertile, and bring into the world births that fill it with wonder and delight.
<p/>Sometimes when a father has an ugly, loutish son, the love he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bears him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so blindfolds his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does not see his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) defects, or, rather, takes them for gifts and charms of mind and body, and talks of them to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends as wit and grace.
<p/>They're both as sorry hacks as Rocinante. ''  (<font color='red'><b>R.</b></font>)</div>I, however--for though I pass for the father, I am but the stepfather to <div class="bookquote">``Don
<p/>Quixote'' (<font color='red'><b>the stepfather</b></font>)</div>--have no desire to go with the current of custom, or to implore thee, dearest reader, almost with tears in my eyes, as others do, to pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceive in this child of mine.
<p/>, thy soul is thine own and thy will as free as any man's, whate'er he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be, thou art in thine own house and master of it as much as the king of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) taxes and thou knowest the common saying,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Under my cloak I kill the king;''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>all which exempts and frees thee from every consideration and obligation, and thou canst say what thou wilt of the story without fear of being abused for any ill or rewarded for any good thou mayest say of it.
<p/>My wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned, without any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary sonnets, epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly put at the beginning of books.
<p/>For I can tell thee, though composing it cost me some labour, I found none greater than the making of this Preface thou art now reading.
<p/>Many times did I take up my pen to write it, and many did I lay it down again, not knowing what to write.
<p/>One of these times, as I was pondering with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbow on the desk, and my cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say, there came in unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine, who, seeing me so deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, making no mystery of it, answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had to make for the story of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which so troubled me that I had a mind not to make any at all, nor even publish the achievements of so noble a knight.
<p/>For, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancient lawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me, after slumbering so many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out now with all my years upon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush, devoid of invention, meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wanting in learning and wisdom, without quotations in the margin or annotations at the end, after the fashion of other books I see, which, though all fables and profanity, are so full of maxims from Aristotle, and Plato, and the whole herd of philosophers, that they fill the readers with amazement and convince them that the authors are men of learning, erudition, and eloquence.
<p/>Scriptures!--anyone would say they are St. Thomases or other doctors of the Church, observing as they do a decorum so ingenious that in one sentence they describe a distracted lover and in the next deliver a devout little sermon that it is a pleasure and a treat to hear and read.
<p/>Of all this there will be nothing in my book, for I have nothing to quote in the margin or to note at the end, and still less
<p/>do I know what authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as all do, under the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and ending with Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer and the other a painter.
<p/>Also my book must do without sonnets at the beginning, at least sonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises, counts, bishops, ladies, or famous poets.
<p/>Though if I were to ask two or three obliging friends, I know they would give me them, and such as the productions of those that have the highest reputation in our Spain could not equal.
<p/>In short, my friend,'' I continued, <div class="bookquote">``I am determined that Senor Don Quixote shall remain buried in the archives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own La Mancha until Heaven provide some one to garnish him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with all those things he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stands in need of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want of learning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy and careless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say without them.
<p/>Thou art neither its kinsman nor its friend ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And then, when they quote the Holy '' Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reason enough, what you have heard from me.
<p/>Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead and breaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Before God, Brother, now am I disabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time I have known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd and sensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as the heaven is from the earth.
<p/>It is possible that things of so little moment and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours, fit to break through and crush far greater obstacles?
<p/>By my faith, this comes, not of any want of ability, but of too much indolence and too little knowledge of life.
<p/>Well, then, attend to me, and you will see how, in the opening and shutting of an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties, and supply all those deficiencies which you say check and discourage you from bringing before the world the story of your famous Don Quixote, the light and mirror of all knight-errantry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say on,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) talk; ``how do you propose to make up for my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I am in?
<p/>To which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Your first difficulty about the sonnets, epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, and which ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed if you yourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwards baptise them, and put any name you like to them, fathering them on Prester John of the Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to my knowledge, were said to have been famous poets: and even if they were not, and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question the fact, never care two maravedis for that, for even if they prove a lie against you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with.
<p/>As to references in the margin to the books and authors from whom you take the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story, it is only contriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of Latin you may happen to have by heart, or at any rate that will not give you much trouble to look up; so as, when you speak of freedom and captivity, to insert Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro; and then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; or, if you allude to the power of death, to come in with-- Pallida mors
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Do you want to know if I am telling the truth? '' '' Aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas, Regumque turres.
<p/>If it be friendship and the love God bids us bear to our enemy, go at once to the Holy Scriptures, which you can do with a very small amount of research, and quote no less than the words of God himself:
<p/>'' Ego autem dico vobis: diligite inimicos vestros. If you speak of evil thoughts, turn to the Gospel: De corde exeunt cogitationes malae.
<p/>If of the fickleness of friends, there is Cato, who will give you his (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) distich: Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos, Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.
<p/>With these and such like bits of Latin they will take you for a grammarian at all events, and that now-a-days is no small honour and profit.
<p/>'' '' With regard to adding annotations at the end of the book, you may safely do it in this way.
<p/>If you mention any giant in your book contrive that it shall be the giant Goliath, and with this alone, which will cost you almost nothing, you have a grand note, for you can put--The giant Golias or Goliath was a Philistine whom the shepherd David slew by a mighty stone-cast in the Terebinth valley, as is related in the Book of Kings--in the chapter where you find it written.
<p/>Next, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature and cosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in your story, and there you are at once with another famous annotation, setting forth--
<p/>The river Tagus was so called after a King of Spain: it has its source in such and such a place and falls into the ocean, kissing the walls of the famous city of Lisbon, and it is a common belief that it has golden sands, etc..
<p/>If you should have anything to do with robbers, I will give you the story of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if with loose women, there is the Bishop of Mondonedo, who will give you the loan of Lamia, Laida, and Flora, any reference to whom will bring you great credit; if with hard-hearted ones, Ovid will furnish you with Medea; if with witches or enchantresses, Homer has Calypso, and Virgil Circe; if with valiant captains, Julius Caesar himself will lend you himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) own `Commentaries,' and Plutarch will give you a thousand Alexanders.
<p/>If you should deal with love, with two ounces you may know of Tuscan you can go to Leon the Hebrew, who will supply you to your heart's content; or if you should not care to go to foreign countries you have at home
<p/>Fonseca's `Of the Love of God,' in which is condensed all that you or the most imaginative mind can want on the subject.
<p/>In short, all you have to do is to manage to quote these names, or refer to these stories I have mentioned, and leave it to me to insert the annotations and quotations, and I swear by all that's good to fill your margins and use up four sheets at the end of the book.
<p/>The remedy for this is very simple: You have only to look out for some book that quotes them all, from A to Z as you say yourself, and then insert the very same alphabet in your book, and though the imposition may be plain to see, because you have so little need to borrow from them, that is no matter; there will probably be some simple enough to believe that you have made use of them all in this plain, artless story of yours.
<p/>At any rate, if it answers no other purpose, this long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of authority to your book.
<p/>Besides, no one will trouble himself to verify whether you have followed them or whether you have not, being no way concerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book of yours has no need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it is, from beginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of which Aristotle never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero had any knowledge; nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations of astrology come within the range of its fanciful vagaries; nor have geometrical measurements or refutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to do with it; nor does it mean to preach to anybody, mixing up things human and divine, a sort of motley in which no Christian understanding should dress itself.
<p/>'' '' Now let us come to those references to authors which other books have, and you want for yours. It has only to avail itself of truth to nature in its composition, and the more perfect the imitation
<p/>And as this piece of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the authority and influence which books of chivalry have in the world and with the public, there is no need for you to go a-begging for aphorisms from philosophers, precepts from Holy Scripture, fables from poets, speeches from orators, or miracles from saints; but merely to take care that your style and diction run musically, pleasantly, and plainly, with clear, proper, and well-placed words, setting forth your purpose to the best of your power, and putting your ideas intelligibly, without confusion or obscurity.
<p/>Strive, too, that in reading your story the melancholy may be moved to laughter, and the merry made merrier still; that the simple shall not be wearied, that the judicious shall admire the invention, that the grave shall not despise it, nor the wise fail to praise it.
<p/>Finally, keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that ill-founded edifice of the books of chivalry, hated by some and praised by many more; for if you succeed in this you will have achieved no small success.
<p/>In profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) observations made such an impression on me that, without attempting to question them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them I determined to make this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou wilt perceive my friend's good sense, my good fortune in finding such an adviser in such a time of need, and what thou hast gained in receiving, without addition or alteration, the story of the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, who is held by all the inhabitants of the district of the Campo de Montiel to have been the chastest lover and the bravest knight that has for many years been seen in that neighbourhood.
<p/>I have no desire to magnify the service I render thee in making thee acquainted with so renowned and honoured a knight, but I do desire
<p/>thy thanks for the acquaintance thou wilt make with the famous Sancho Panza, his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) squire, in whom, to my thinking, I have given thee condensed all the squirely drolleries that are scattered through the swarm of the vain books of chivalry.
<p/>the better the work will be. '' And so--may God give thee health, and not forget me. Vale. DEDICATION OF VOLUME
<p/>I TO THE DUKE OF BEJAR, MARQUIS OF GIBRALEON, COUNT OF BENALCAZAR AND BANARES, VICECOUNT OF THE PUEBLA DE ALCOCER, MASTER OF THE TOWNS OF CAPILLA, CURIEL AND BURGUILLOS
<p/>In belief of the good reception and honours that Your Excellency bestows on all sort of books, as prince so inclined to favor good arts, chiefly those who by their nobleness do not submit to the service and bribery of the vulgar, I have determined bringing to light The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of la Mancha, in shelter of Your Excellency's glamorous name, to whom, with the obeisance I owe to such grandeur, I pray to receive it agreeably under his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) protection, so that in this shadow, though deprived of that precious ornament of elegance and erudition that clothe the works composed in the houses of those who know, it dares appear with assurance in the judgment of some who, trespassing the bounds of their own ignorance, use to condemn with more rigour and less justice the writings of others.
<p/>It is my earnest hope that Your Excellency's good counsel in regard to my honourable purpose, will not disdain the littleness of so humble a service.
<p/>Miguel de Cervantes VOLUME I. CHAPTER I. WHICH TREATS OF THE CHARACTER AND PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA
<p/>In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing.
<p/>An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) income.
<p/>The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) made a brave figure in his (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) best homespun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook.
<p/>The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman.
<p/>They will have it his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) surname was Quixada or Quesada -LRB-for here there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject-RRB-, although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) was called Quexana.
<p/>This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray a hair's breadth from the truth in the telling of it.
<p/>You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was at leisure -LRB-which was mostly all the year round-RRB- gave himself up to reading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) almost entirely neglected the pursuit of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) field-sports, and even the management of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) property; and to such a pitch did his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eagerness and infatuation go that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and brought home as many of them as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could get.
<p/>But of all there were none he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva's composition, for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sight,
<p/>particularly when in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) reading he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came upon courtships and cartels, where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) often found passages like <div class="bookquote">``the reason of the unreason with which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or again, ``the high heavens, that of your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness deserves.
<p/>Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them and worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or extracted had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) come to life again for that special purpose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) must have had his (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) face and body covered all over with seams and scars.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) commended, however, the author's way of ending his (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) book with the promise of that interminable adventure, and many a time was he (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) tempted to take up his (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>).
<p/>Many an argument did he (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) have with the curate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) village -LRB-a learned man, and a graduate of Siguenza-RRB- as to which had been the better knight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul.
<p/>Master Nicholas, the village barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) had a spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose like his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brother, while in the matter of valour he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was not a whit behind him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) became so absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) books that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) nights from sunset to sunrise, and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) days from dawn to dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much reading his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brains got so dry that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wits.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fancy grew full of what he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) used to read about in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) read of was true, that to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) no history in the world had more reality in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Diaz</b></font>) was not to be compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) strangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) arms.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) approved highly of the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) alone was affable and well-bred.
<p/>But above all he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) sallying forth from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) castle and robbing everyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) met, and when beyond the seas he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) stole that image of Mahomet which, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) history says, was entirely of gold.
<p/>To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a Ganelon he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) would have given his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) housekeeper, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) niece into the bargain.
<p/>In short, his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) wits being quite gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) hit upon the strangest notion that ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the support of his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) own honour as for the service of his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) country, that he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) had read of as being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) was to reap eternal renown and fame.
<p/>Already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found in these pleasant fancies, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set himself forthwith to put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scheme into execution.
<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scoured and polished it as best he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perceived one great defect in it, that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion.
<p/>This deficiency, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ingenuity supplied, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one.
<p/>It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an instant what had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a week to do.
<p/>The ease with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somewhat, and to guard against that danger he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next proceeded to inspect his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that <div class="bookquote">``tantum pellis et ossa fuit,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>surpassed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid.
<p/>Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), because -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to himself-RRB- it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own, should be without some distinctive name, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) then was
<p/>; for it was only reasonable that, his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) master taking a new character, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) should take a new name, and that it should be a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was about to follow.
<p/>And so, after having composed, struck out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) memory and fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) decided upon calling him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) Rocinante, a name, to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) condition as a hack before he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) became what he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world.
<p/>Having got a name for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse so much to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) taste, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was anxious to get one for himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was eight days more pondering over this point, till at last he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mind to call himself <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and not Quesada as others would have it.
<p/>Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quesada</b></font>) kingdom and country to make it famous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>), like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>), and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) considered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) described accurately his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) origin and country, and did honour to it in taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) surname from it.
<p/>So then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) armour being furbished, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) morion turned into a helmet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) hack christened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) himself confirmed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) said to himself, ``If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, and overthrow him (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) in one onslaught, or cleave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>), will it not be well to have some one I may send him (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) to as a present, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) may come in and fall on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, 'I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure'?
<p/>Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had thought of some one to call his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Lady!
<p/>There was, so the story goes, in a village near his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own a very good-looking farm-girl with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) thought fit to confer the title of Lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not be out of harmony with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) own, and should suggest and indicate that of a princess and great lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) decided upon calling her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Dulcinea del Toboso--
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) being of El Toboso--a name, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) mind, musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) had already bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>).
<p/>These preliminaries settled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) did not care to put off any longer the execution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world was losing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) delay, seeing what wrongs he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) intended to right, grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties to discharge.
<p/>So, without giving notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) intention to anyone, and without anybody seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>), one morning before the dawning of the day -LRB-which was one of the hottest of the month of July-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) donned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) patched-up helmet on, braced his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) buckler, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) lance, and by the back door of the yard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with what ease he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) had made a beginning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) grand purpose.
<p/>But scarcely did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible thought struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>), one all but enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) abandon the enterprise at the very outset.
<p/>It occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) had not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) had been, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) ought, as a novice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the shield until by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) prowess he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) had earned one.
<p/>These reflections made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) waver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) purpose, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) craze being stronger than any reasoning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) came across, following the example of others in the same case, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) had read in the books that brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) to this pass.
<p/>As for white armour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) resolved, on the first opportunity, to scour his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) until it was whiter than an ermine; and so comforting himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) way, taking that which his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) horse chose, for in this he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) believed lay the essence of adventures.
<p/>Thus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to himself and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Who knows but that in time to come, when the veracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will do it after this fashion? '
<p/>Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o'er the face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) bright hair, scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy Dawn, that, deserting the soft couch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dawn</b></font>) jealous spouse, was appearing to mortals at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan horizon, when the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) celebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and famous Campo de Montiel;'''  (<font color='red'><b>adventurer</b></font>)</div>which in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Montiel</b></font>) was actually traversing.
<p/>Happy the age, happy the time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Montiel</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``in which shall be made known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble, limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever.
<p/>And thou, O sage magician, whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this wondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER II. WHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROM HOME '' my good Rocinante, the constant companion of my ways and wanderings.
<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) broke out again, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) were love-stricken in earnest, <div class="bookquote">``O Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive heart, a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me forth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy beauty.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>O lady, deign to hold in remembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for love of thee.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in the style of those his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) books had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), imitating their language as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could; and all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) rode so slowly and the sun mounted so rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) brains if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had any.
<p/>Nearly all day he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) travelled without anything remarkable happening to him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), at which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was in despair, for he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was anxious to encounter some one at once upon whom to try the might of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) strong arm.
<p/>Writers there are who say the first adventure he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) met with was that of Puerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I have ascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals of La Mancha, is that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was on the road all day, and towards nightfall his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hack
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking all around to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could discover any castle or shepherd's shanty where he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) might refresh himself and relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sore wants, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) perceived not far out of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to the portals, if not the palaces, of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) redemption; and quickening his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) pace he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) reached it just as night was setting in.
<p/>At the door were standing two young women, girls of the district as they call them, on their way to Seville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn; and as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) saw or imaged seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) to be and to happen after the fashion of what he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) read of, the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) saw the inn he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort.
<p/>To this inn, which to him (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) seemed a castle, he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) advanced, and at a short distance from it he (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would show himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight was approaching the castle.
<p/>But seeing that they were slow about it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made for the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there, and who seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate.
<p/>At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the stubbles collecting a drove of pigs -LRB-for, without any apology, that is what they are called-RRB- gave a blast of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horn to bring them together, and forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was expecting, the signal of some dwarf announcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arrival; and so with prodigious satisfaction he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were turning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by their flight, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pasteboard visor, disclosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) dry dusty visage, and with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them, ``Your ladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to the order of knighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be.
<p/>The girls were looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and straining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy visor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing so much out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, which made Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, ``Modesty becomes the fair, and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this, however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none other than to serve you.
<p/>The incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier only increased the ladies' laughter, and that increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) irritation, and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had not come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but, in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought it best to speak him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fairly, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, ``Senor Caballero, if your worship wants lodging, bating the bed -LRB-for there is not one in the inn-RRB- there is plenty of everything else here.
<p/>Don Quixote, observing the respectful bearing of the Alcaide of the fortress -LRB-for so innkeeper and inn seemed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes-RRB-, made answer, ``Sir Castellan, for me anything will suffice, for '
<p/>The host fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) Castellan because he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for a <div class="bookquote">``worthy of Castile,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was in fact an Andalusian, and one from the strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks as a student or a page.
<p/>'' '' '' '' My armour is my only wear, My only rest the fray.' '' '' In that case,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>), '''
<p/>Your sleep to watch alway;' and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a single night.
<p/>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who got down with great difficulty and exertion -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had not broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fast all day-RRB-, and then charged the host to take great care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world.
<p/>The landlord eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) over but did not find him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as good as Don Quixote said, nor even half as good; and putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) up in the stable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) returned to see what might be wanted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) guest, whom the damsels, who had by this time made their peace with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), were now relieving of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour.
<p/>They had taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) gorget or remove his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) make-shift helmet, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had fastened it with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut.
<p/>This, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not by any means consent to, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) remained all the evening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour, taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to the castle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to them with great sprightliness:
<p/>Your bed is on the flinty rock, '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, never, surely, was there knight So served by hand of dame, As served was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), Don Quixote hight,
<p/>; With maidens waiting on himself, Princesses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hack-- or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse's name, and Don Quixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention of declaring myself until my achievements in your service and honour had made me known, the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to the present occasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely.
<p/>A time, however, will come for your ladyships to command and me to obey, and then the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you.
<p/>The girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had nothing to say in reply; they only asked him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) wanted anything to eat.
<p/>When from his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) town he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) came ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' I would gladly eat a bit of something,'' said Don Quixote, ``for I feel it would come very seasonably.
<p/>The day happened to be a Friday, and in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call in Castile <div class="bookquote">``abadejo,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>in Andalusia <div class="bookquote">``bacallao,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>and in some places <div class="bookquote">``curadillo,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>and in others <div class="bookquote">``troutlet;
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>so they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>If there be troutlets enough,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``they will be the same thing as a trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight reals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that these troutlets are like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which is better than goat.
<p/>But whatever it be let it come quickly, for the burden and pressure of arms cannot be borne without support to the inside.
<p/>They laid a table for him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) at the door of the inn for the sake of the air, and the host brought him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) own armour; but a laughable sight it was to see him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) eating, for having his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) helmet on and the beaver up, he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) could not with his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) own hands put anything into his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) mouth unless some one else placed it there, and this service one of the ladies rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>).
<p/>so had not the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) mouth poured the wine into him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) through the other; all which he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) bore with patience rather than sever the ribbons of his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) helmet.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' But to give him (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) anything to drink was impossible, or would have been While this was going on there came up to the inn
<p/>a sowgelder, who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) approached, sounded his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) reed pipe four or five times, and thereby completely convinced Don Quixote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was in some famous castle, and that they were regaling him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with music, and that the stockfish was trout, the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellan of the castle; and consequently he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) held that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enterprise and sally had been to some purpose.
<p/>But still it distressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had not been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood.
<p/>HIMSELF DUBBED A KNIGHT Harassed by this reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made haste with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) scanty pothouse supper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting himself into the stable with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knees before him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``From this spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the boon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the human race.
<p/>The landlord, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) guest at his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) feet and hearing a speech of this kind, stood staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in bewilderment, not knowing what to do or say, and entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to rise, but all to no purpose until he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>I looked for no less, my lord, from your High Magnificence,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``and I have to tell you that the boon I have asked and your liberality has granted is that you shall dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle; thus to-morrow, as I have said, will be accomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roam through all the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalf of those in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errant like myself, whose ambition is directed to such deeds.
<p/>The landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and had already some suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) guest's want of wits, was quite convinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and to make sport for the night he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) determined to fall in with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) humour.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was quite right in pursuing the object he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had in view, and that such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) seemed and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) gallant bearing showed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to be; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) younger days had followed the same honourable calling, roaming in quest of adventures in various parts of the world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market of Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of San Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other quarters, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) had proved the nimbleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) feet and the lightness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids and swindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) had retired to this castle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>), where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) was living upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) property and upon that of others; and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) received all knights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for the great love he (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) bore them and that they might share their substance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) in return for his (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) benevolence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>), moreover, that in this castle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) there was no chapel in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) could watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) armour, as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of necessity it might, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) knew, be watched anywhere, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) might watch it that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God willing, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dubbed a knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had any money with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), to which Don Quixote replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had never read of any of them carrying any.
<p/>On this point the landlord told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories, because in the author's opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore that they did not carry them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might regard it as certain and established that all knights-errant -LRB-about whom there were so many full and unimpeachable books-RRB- carried well-furnished purses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to cure the wounds they received.
<p/>For in those plains and deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, it was not always that there was some one to cure them, unless indeed they had for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetching through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had not received any damage whatever.
<p/>But in case this should not occur, the knights of old took care to see that their squires were provided with money and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healing purposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires -LRB-which was rarely and seldom the case-RRB- they themselves carried everything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse's croup, as if it were something else of more importance, because, unless for some such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regarded among knights-errant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) therefore advised him (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) -LRB-and, as his (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) godson so soon to be, he (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) might even command him (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>)-RRB- never from that time forth to travel without money and the usual requirements, and he (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) would find the advantage of them when he (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) least expected it.
<p/>Don Quixote promised to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) advice scrupulously, and it was arranged forthwith that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour in a large yard at one side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it on a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance and began with a stately air to march up and down in front of the trough, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) march night began to fall.
<p/>The landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) contemplated.
<p/>Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they flocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance, gazed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour without taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes off it for ever so long; and as the night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that lent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen by all.
<p/>Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote's armour as it lay on the trough; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seeing the other approach hailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in a loud voice, <div class="bookquote">``O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a care
<p/>CHAPTER III. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life as the penalty of thy rashness.
<p/>The carrier gave no heed to these words -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) would have done better to heed them if he (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) had been heedful of his (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) health-RRB-, but seizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>).
<p/>Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes to heaven, and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thoughts, apparently, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Aid me, lady mine, in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy;''  (<font color='red'><b>lady Dulcinea/Dulcinea/lady Dulcinea del Toboso</b></font>)</div>and, with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow on the carrier's head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stretched him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) on the ground, so stunned that had he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) followed it up with a second there would have been no need of a surgeon to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>).
<p/>Shortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened -LRB-for the carrier still lay senseless-RRB-, came with the same object of giving water to his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear the trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid from anyone, once more dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler and once more lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance, and without actually breaking the second carrier's head into pieces, made more than three of it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) laid it open in four.
<p/>'' This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) beat with the same serenity as before. At the noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the landlord.
<p/>Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``O Lady of Beauty, strength and support of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an adventure.
<p/>By this he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) felt himself so inspired that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would not have flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>The comrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour unprotected.
<p/>The landlord shouted to them to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) alone, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had already told them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was mad, and as a madman he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not be accountable even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) killed them all.
<p/>Still louder shouted Don Quixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle, who allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born knight whom, had he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) received the order of knighthood, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would call to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) treachery.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' But of you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) cried, ``base and vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) uttered with so much spirit and boldness that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) filled his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) assailants with a terrible fear, and as much for this reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same calmness and composure as before resumed the watch over his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) armour.
<p/>But these freaks of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) guest were not much to the liking of the landlord, so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) determined to cut matters short and confer upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) at once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could occur; so, going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) apologised for the rudeness which, without his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) knowledge, had been offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) by these low people, who, however, had been well punished for their audacity.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had already told him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed for what remained to be done, for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) understood the ceremonial of the order,
<p/>the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle of a field; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had now done all that was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had been more than four about it.
<p/>Don Quixote believed it all, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stood there ready to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and to make an end of it with as much despatch as possible; for, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought, leave a soul alive in the castle, except such as out of respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might spare at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bidding.
<p/>Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) used to enter the straw and barley he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) served out to the carriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels already mentioned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) kneel down.
<p/>Then, reading from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) account-book as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) were repeating some devout prayer, in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) delivery he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own sword, a smart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) teeth as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was saying his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) prayers.
<p/>Having done this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) directed one of the ladies to gird on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did with great self-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice knight's prowess kept their laughter within bounds.
<p/>On girding him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) with the sword the worthy lady said to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``May God make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success in battle.
<p/>Don Quixote asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might from that time forward know to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was beholden for the favour he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had received, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant to confer upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) some portion of the honour he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) acquired by the might of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered with great humility that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was called La Tolosa, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might be she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would serve and esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lord.
<p/>can against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly and insolence will be. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Don Quixote said in reply that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a favour
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) promised she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would, and then the other buckled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spur, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) followed almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said it was La Molinera, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the daughter of a respectable miller of Antequera; and of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) likewise Don Quixote requested that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would adopt the <div class="bookquote">``Don''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and call herself Dona Molinera, making offers to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dona</b></font>) further services and favours.
<p/>Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling Rocinante at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mounted, and embracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) host, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) returned thanks for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) kindness in knighting him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in language so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it.
<p/>The landlord, to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to pay the reckoning let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) go with a Godspeed.
<p/>WHEN HE (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) LEFT THE INN Day was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) joy was like to burst his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse-girths.
<p/>However, recalling the advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) host as to the requisites he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ought to carry with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), especially that referring to money and shirts, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) determined to go home and provide himself with all, and also with a squire, for he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) reckoned upon securing a farm-labourer, a neighbour of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), a poor man with a family, but very well qualified for the office of squire to a knight.
<p/>With this object he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse's head towards his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) village, and Rocinante, thus reminded of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hardly seemed to tread the earth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) right there seemed to come feeble cries as of some one in distress, and the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) heard them he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me, that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I have undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition.
<p/>These cries, no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid and protection;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and wheeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned Rocinante in the direction whence the cries seemed to proceed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone but a few paces into the wood, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age, from whom the cries came.
<p/>Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer was flogging him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings and commands, repeating, <div class="bookquote">``Your mouth shut and your eyes open!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>while the youth made answer, ``I won't do it again, master mine; by God's passion I won't do it again, and I'll take more care of the flock another time.
<p/>Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice, <div class="bookquote">``Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend himself; mount your steed and take your lance
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for there was a lance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied-RRB-, ``and I will make you know that you are behaving as a coward.
<p/>if thenceforward she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) assumed the <div class="bookquote">``Don''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and called herself Dona Tolosa. CHAPTER IV. OF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT '' ''
<p/>The farmer, seeing before him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) head, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, <div class="bookquote">``Sir Knight, this youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) is so careless that I lose one every day, and
<p/>when I punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) carelessness and knavery he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) says I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) the wages I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), and before God, and on my soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lies before me, base clown!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' By the sun that shines on us I have a mind to run you through with this lance.
<p/>Pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) at once without another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an end of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) instantly.
<p/>The farmer hung his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) head, and without a word untied his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) servant, of whom Don Quixote asked how much his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Don Quixote added it up, found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay it down immediately, if he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) did not want to die for it.
<p/>The trembling clown replied that as he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) lived and by the oath he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) had sworn -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) had not sworn any-RRB- it was not so much; for there were to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>), and a real for two blood-lettings when he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) was sick.
<p/>All that is very well,'' said Don Quixote; ``but let the shoes and the blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) without any cause; for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid for, you have damaged that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) body, and if the barber took blood from him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was sick, you have drawn it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was sound; so on that score he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) owes you nothing.

 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the perfumery I excuse you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in reals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn; if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard.
<p/>And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties that have been already declared to you.
<p/>The farmer followed him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) eyes, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had cleared the wood and was no longer in sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) boy Andres, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of wrongs has commanded me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Andres</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. '' My oath on it,'' said Andres, <div class="bookquote">``your worship will be well advised to obey the command of that good knight
<p/>--may he (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) live a thousand years--for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) will come back and do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Andres</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``but as I have a strong affection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) by the arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) up again, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) such a flogging that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) for dead.
<p/>Now, Master Andres,'' said the farmer, ``call on the undoer of wrongs; you will find he (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) won't undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.
<p/>But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) untied him (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>), and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) leave to go look for his (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) judge in order to put the sentence pronounced into execution.
<p/>Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be repaid him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sevenfold; but for all that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went off weeping, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master stood laughing.
<p/>Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly satisfied with what had taken place, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) considered he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had made a very happy and noble beginning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knighthood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took the road towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Well mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as all the world knows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, and hath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance
<p/>that ever injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) was reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to consider which road they should take.
<p/>In imitation of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) halted for a while, and after having deeply considered it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) gave Rocinante his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) head, submitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) own will to that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) hack, who followed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) first intention, which was to make straight for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) own stable.
<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to buy silk at Murcia.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>My oath on it, too,'' said the farmer; '' '' '' There were six of them coming along under their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot.
<p/>Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that this must be some new adventure; and to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to imitate as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could those passages he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had read of in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) books, here seemed to come one made on purpose, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) resolved to attempt.
<p/>So with a lofty bearing and determination he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fixed himself firmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stirrups, got his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance ready, brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler before his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) breast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant, for such he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) now considered and held them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exclaimed with a haughty gesture, ``All the world stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>The traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the strange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at once guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Sir Knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of; show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to us, for, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) be of such beauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on your part required of us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>If I were to show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to you,'' replied Don Quixote, ``what merit would you have in confessing a truth so manifest?
<p/>The essential point is that without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant rabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause I maintain.
<p/>``I entreat your worship in the name of this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard of, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe we are already so far agreed with you that
<p/>even though her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) portrait should show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) favour that you desire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, burning with rage, ``nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and civet in cotton; nor is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered against beauty like that of my lady.
<p/>And so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) charged with levelled lance against the one who had spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived that Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone hard with the rash trader.
<p/>Down went Rocinante, and over went his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) master, rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) tried to rise he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) was unable, so encumbered was he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) old armour; and all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) was struggling to get up he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) kept saying, <div class="bookquote">``Fly not, cowards and caitiffs!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Sir Knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>replied the trader, '' '' stay, for not by my fault, but my horse's, am I stretched here.
<p/>One of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good nature in him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style, was unable to refrain from giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) an answer on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) ribs; and coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>)
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) milled him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) like a measure of wheat.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) masters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) alone, but the muleteers blood was up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not care to drop the game until he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had vented the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wrath, and gathering up the remaining fragments of the lance he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) never ceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such they seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>At last the muleteer was tired, and the traders continued their journey, taking with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been cudgelled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) found himself alone made another effort to rise; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was unable when whole and sound, how was he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to rise after having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces?
<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that this was a regular knight-errant's mishap, and entirely, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) considered, the fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) horse.
<p/>THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT'S MISHAP IS CONTINUED Finding, then, that, in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could not move, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought himself of having recourse to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) usual remedy, which was to think of some passage in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) books, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) craze brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mind that about Baldwin and the Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) wounded on the mountain side, a story known by heart by the children, not forgotten by the young men, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and for all that not a whit truer than the miracles of Mahomet.
<p/>This seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) to fit exactly the case in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) found himself, so, making a show of severe suffering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) began to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight of the wood is said to have uttered: Where art thou, lady mine, that thou
<p/>'' However, battered in body as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was, to rise was beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) power. CHAPTER V. IN WHICH My sorrow dost not rue?
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went on with the ballad as far as the lines: O noble Marquis of Mantua, My Uncle and liege lord!
<p/>As chance would have it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) had got to this line there happened to come by a peasant from his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) own village, a neighbour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>), who had been with a load of wheat to the mill, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>), seeing the man stretched there, came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) who he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) was and what was the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) complained so dolefully.
<p/>Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) uncle, so the only answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) made was to go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) ballad, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) told the tale of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor's son and his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.
<p/>The peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) of the visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) face, which was covered with dust, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had done so he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor Quixada''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for so he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) appears to have been called when he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) senses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman into a knight-errant-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``who has brought your worship to this pass?
<p/>Thou canst not know it, lady mine, Or else thou art untrue. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a country gentleman</b></font>)</div>But to all questions the other only went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) ballad.
<p/>Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breastplate and backpiece to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had any wound, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could perceive no blood nor any mark whatever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then contrived to raise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the ground, and with no little difficulty hoisted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ass, which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be the easiest mount for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and collecting the arms, even to the splinters of the lance, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tied them on Rocinante, and leading him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the bridle and the ass by the halter he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the road for the village, very sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was talking.
<p/>Nor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sent up sighs to heaven, so that once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) drove the peasant to ask what ailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>And it could have been only the devil himself that put into his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) head tales to match his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) bethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him (<font color='blue'><b>Narvaez</b></font>) prisoner and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Narvaez</b></font>) away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Narvaez</b></font>) castle; so that when the peasant again asked him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was and what ailed him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) for reply the same words and phrases that the captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Narvaez</b></font>) had read the story in the <div class="bookquote">``Diana''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written, applying it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Montemayor</b></font>) own case so aptly that the peasant went along cursing his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) fate that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) came to the conclusion that his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote's; who, at the end of it, said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa I have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I have done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.
<p/>your worship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of Mantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is neither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Senor Quixada?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know who I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``and I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all together and each of them on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own account.
<p/>With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a miserable trim.
<p/>When it was what seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) the proper time he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) entered the village and went to Don Quixote's house, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found all in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who were great friends of Don Quixote, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) housekeeper was saying to them in a loud voice, <div class="bookquote">``What does your worship think can have befallen my master, Senor Licentiate Pero Perez?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)</div>for so the curate was called; <div class="bookquote">``it is three days now since anything has been seen of him (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>), or the hack, or the buckler, lance, or armour.
<p/>I am certain of it, and it is as true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books of chivalry he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly, have upset his (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) reason; for now I remember having often heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) saying to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) would turn knight-errant and go all over the world in quest of adventures.
<p/>To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that have brought to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in all La Mancha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>The niece said the same, and, more: <div class="bookquote">``You must know, Master Nicholas'' (<font color='red'><b>The niece</b></font>)</div>--for that was the name of the barber--<div class="bookquote">``it was often my uncle's way to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy books of misventures, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would fling the book away and snatch up his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was tired out he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would say he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat that flowed from him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was weary he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said was the blood of the wounds he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had received in battle; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm and quiet, saying that this water was a most precious potion which the sage Esquife, a great magician and friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>But I take all the blame upon myself for never having told your worships of my uncle's vagaries, that you might put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burn all these accursed books--for he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has a great number--that richly deserve to be burned like heretics.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div><p/>So say I too,'' said the curate, ``and by my faith to-morrow shall not pass without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to the flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend seems to have behaved.
<p/>All this the peasant heard, and from it he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) understood at last what was the matter with his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) neighbour, so he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) began calling aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Open, your worships, to Senor Baldwin and to Senor the Marquis of Mantua, who comes badly wounded, and to Senor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the valiant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for I am badly wounded through my horse's fault; carry me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and see to my wounds.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To this the peasant answered, <div class="bookquote">``Senor--sinner that I am!--cannot ''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasant sinner</b></font>)</div>Miserable me!

<p/>A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a pass.
<p/>They carried him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to bed at once, and after searching for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wounds could find none, but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said they were all bruises from having had a severe fall with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth.
<p/>To bed with your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here without fetching that Hurgada. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>So, so!'' said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``are there giants in the dance? By the sign of the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.
<p/>They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) only answer to all was--give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) something to eat, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to sleep, for that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) needed most.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at great length as to how he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had found Don Quixote.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and the nonsense he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the licentiate the more eager to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did the next day, which was to summon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) to Don Quixote's house.
<p/>CHAPTER VI. OF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER MADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and right willingly she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) gave them.
<p/>They all went in, the housekeeper with them, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some other small ones.
<p/>The moment the housekeeper saw them she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediately with a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Here, your worship, senor licentiate, sprinkle this room; don't leave any magician of the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them from the world.
<p/>The simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) directed the barber to give him (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) the books one by one to see what they were about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not deserve the penalty of fire.
<p/>No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the niece, <div class="bookquote">``there is no reason for showing mercy to any of them; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them out of the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to them; or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made without the smoke giving any annoyance.
<p/>The housekeeper said the same, so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but the curate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate the titles.
<p/>GENTLEMAN ''  (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div>'' '' The first that Master Nicholas put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) hand was <div class="bookquote">``The four books of Amadis of Gaul.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``I too, have heard say that this is the best of all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, as something singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.

<p/>Take it, mistress housekeeper; open the window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for the bonfire we are to make.
<p/>The housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy <div class="bookquote">``Esplandian''  (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div>went flying into the yard to await with all patience the fire that was in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>This that comes next,'' said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``is `Amadis of Greece,' and, indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis lineage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div><p/>Then to the yard with the whole of them,'' said the curate; <div class="bookquote">``for to have the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) author, I would burn with them the father who begot me if he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) were going about in the guise of a knight-errant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Proceed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I am of the same mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber. '' And so am I,'' added the niece.
<p/>They were handed to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and as there were many of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) spared herself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.
<p/>'' In that case,'' said the housekeeper, <div class="bookquote">``here, into the yard with them! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>'' Who is that tub there?'' said the curate.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The author of that book,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``was the same that wrote `The Garden of Flowers,' and truly there is no deciding which of the two books is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying; all I can say is, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This,'' said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``is `Don Olivante de Laura.'''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>'' This that follows is `Florismarte of Hircania,''' said the barber.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``With all my heart, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), and executed the order with great delight.

 (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An old book that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``but I find no reason for clemency in it; send it after the others without appeal;''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>which was done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For the sake of the holy name this book has,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, ``its ignorance might be excused; but then, they say, `behind the cross there's the devil; to the fire with it.
<p/>Another book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, <div class="bookquote">``The Knight of the Cross.''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>'' Taking down another book, the barber said, <div class="bookquote">``This is `The Mirror of Chivalry.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know his (<font color='blue'><b>Chivalry</b></font>) worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate; <div class="bookquote">``that is where Senor Reinaldos of Montalvan figures with his (<font color='blue'><b>Chivalry</b></font>) friends and comrades, greater thieves than Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian Turpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual banishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the invention of the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico Ariosto wove his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) web, to whom, if I find him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) here, and speaking any language but his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) own
<p/>, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) speaks his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) own tongue I will put him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) upon my head.
<p/>Nor would it be well that you should understand him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, ``and on that score we might have excused the Captain if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had not brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) into Spain and turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) into Castilian.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) of a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) natural force, and so do all those who try to turn books written in verse into another language, for, with all the pains they take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the level of the originals as they were first produced.
<p/>In short, I say that this book, and all that may be found treating of those French affairs, should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until after more consideration it is settled what is to be done with them; excepting always one `Bernardo del Carpio' that is going about, and another called `Roncesvalles;' for these, if they come into my hands, shall pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into the fire without any reprieve.
<p/>To all this the barber gave his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) assent, and looked upon it as right and proper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith and loyal to the Truth that he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) would not for the world say anything opposed to them.
<p/>Opening another book he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) saw it was <div class="bookquote">``Palmerin de Oliva,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and beside it was another called <div class="bookquote">``Palmerin of England,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>seeing which the licentiate said, <div class="bookquote">``Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned until no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and preserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case be made for it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius and set aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer.
<p/>This book, gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very good, and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise and witty king of Portugal.
<p/>All the adventures at the Castle of Miraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the language is polished and clear, studying and observing the style befitting the speaker with propriety and judgment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the licentiate</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I have him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) in Italian,'' said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``but I do not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>'' '' So then, provided it seems good to you, Master Nicholas, I say let
<p/>this and `Amadis of Gaul' be remitted the penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without further question or query.''
<p/>Well,'' said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``that and the second, third, and fourth parts all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile, and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and other greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the over-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice be meted out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in your house and let no one read them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate parts</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber; and not caring to tire himself with reading more books of chivalry, he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) told the housekeeper to take all the big ones and throw them into the yard.
<p/>It was not said to one dull or deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a time, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) flung them out of the window.
<p/>In carrying so many together she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) let one fall at the feet of the barber, who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it said, ``History of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, gossip,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``for this that I have here is the famous `Don Belianis.' ''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``God bless me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate Blanco</b></font>)</div>said the curate with a shout, ''`Tirante el Blanco' here!
<p/>Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury of enjoyment and a mine of recreation.
<p/>Here is Don Kyrieleison of Montalvan, a valiant knight, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) brother Thomas of Montalvan, and the knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the mastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves and wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the squire Hipolito--in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best book in the world.
<p/>Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds, and make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which there is nothing in all the other books.
<p/>Nevertheless, I say he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) who wrote it, for deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the galleys for life.
<p/>Take it home with you and read it, and you will see that what I have said is true. '' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate; and opening one he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) saw it was the <div class="bookquote">``Diana''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing all the others to be of the same sort, <div class="bookquote">``these,''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Montemayor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``do not deserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do the mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books of entertainment that can hurt no one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, senor!''  (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div>said the niece, <div class="bookquote">``your worship had better order these to be burned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being cured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Montemayor</b></font>) chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a fancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is an incurable and infectious malady.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div><p/>The damsel is right,'' said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``and it will be well to put this stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend's way.
<p/>As you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the barber; <div class="bookquote">``but what are we to do with these little books that are left?''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>'' To begin, then, with the `Diana' of Montemayor.
<p/>I am of opinion it should not be burned, but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage Felicia and the magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of verse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the first of books of the kind.
<p/>This that comes next,'' said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``is the `Diana,' entitled the `Second Part, by the Salamancan,' and this other has the same title, and its author is Gil Polo.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber Diana</b></font>)</div><p/>As for that of the Salamancan,'' replied the curate, <div class="bookquote">``let it go to swell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo's be preserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and make haste, for it is growing late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>This book,'' said the barber, opening another, <div class="bookquote">``is the ten books of the `Fortune of Love,' written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber books</b></font>)</div><p/>By the orders I have received,'' said the curate, ``since Apollo has been Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets, so droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it is the best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet appeared, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) who has not read it may be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) has never read what is delightful.
<p/>Give it here, gossip, for I make more account of having found it than if they had given me a cassock of Florence stuff.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Muses</b></font>) put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on, <div class="bookquote">``These that come next are `The Shepherd of Iberia,' `Nymphs of Henares,' and `The Enlightenment of Jealousy.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then all we have to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``is to hand them over to the secular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never have done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' '' '' '' This next is the `Pastor de Filida.''' <div class="bookquote">``No Pastor that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate courtier</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``but a highly polished courtier; let it be preserved as a precious jewel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate courtier</b></font>)</div><p/>If there were not so many of them,'' said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``they would be more relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain vulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved because the author is a friend of mine, and out of respect for other more heroic and loftier works that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) has written.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This large one here,'' said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``is called `The Treasury of various Poems.' ''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>'' '' This,'' continued the barber, ``is the `Cancionero' of Lopez de Maldonado.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The author of that book, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate friend</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``is a great friend of mine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) verses from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own mouth are the admiration of all who hear them, for such is the sweetness of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) voice that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) enchants when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is good was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been set apart.
<p/>That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) has had more experience in reverses than in verses.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cervantes</b></font>) book has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but brings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part
<p/>it promises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you, senor gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber; ``and here come three together, the `Araucana' of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the `Austriada' of Juan Rufo, Justice of Cordova, and the `Montserrate' of Christobal de Virues, the Valencian poet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``These three books,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``are the best that have been written in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the most famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of poetry that Spain possesses.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>But what book is that next it?'' '' The `Galatea' of Miguel de Cervantes,'' said the barber. '' '' ''
<p/>The curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) decided that, <div class="bookquote">``contents uncertified,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>all the rest should be burned; but just then the barber held open one, called ``The Tears of Angelica.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have shed tears myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate when he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) heard the title, <div class="bookquote">``had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of the famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy in the translation of some of Ovid's fables.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER VII. OF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA At this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, <div class="bookquote">``Here, here, valiant knights!
<p/>here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong arms, for they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>Called away by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with the scrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that <div class="bookquote">``The Carolea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Lion of Spain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``The Deeds of the Emperor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don</b></font>)</div>written by Don Luis de Avila, went to the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubt they were among those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen them
<p/>When they reached Don Quixote he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was already out of bed, and was still shouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had never slept.
<p/>They closed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and by force got him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back to bed, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had become a little calm, addressing the curate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``Of a truth, Senor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having carried off the honour on the three former days.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, gossip,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate; <div class="bookquote">``please God, the luck may turn, and what is lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your worship have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are over-fatigued, if not badly wounded.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wounded no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``but bruised and battered no doubt, for that bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree, and all for envy, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) sees that I alone rival him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) achievements.
<p/>did he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) not pay me for it in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) enchantments as soon as I rise from this bed.
<p/>For the present let them bring me something to eat, for that, I feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to avenge myself.
<p/>They did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) wished; they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) something to eat, and once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) fell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) madness.
<p/>That night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the yard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed that deserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and the laziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.
<p/>One of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied to their friend's disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where the books were, so that when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got up he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should not find them -LRB-possibly the cause being removed the effect might cease-RRB-, and they might say that a magician had carried them off, room and all; and this was done with all despatch.
<p/>Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did was to go and look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) books, and not finding the room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had left it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wandered from side to side looking for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) came to the place where the door used to be, and tried it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hands, and turned and twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after a good while he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) books.
<p/>The housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was to answer, said, <div class="bookquote">``What room or what nothing is it that your worship is looking for?
<p/>they would not have undergone so severe a sentence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan '' There are neither room nor books in this house now, for the devil himself has carried all away.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not the devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>the niece magician housekeeper</b></font>)</div>said the niece, <div class="bookquote">``but a magician who came on a cloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting from a serpent that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) rode he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) entered the room, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) did there I know not, but after a little while he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) made off, flying through the roof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the housekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice that, for a private grudge he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) owed the owner of the books and the room
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) said too that his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) name was the Sage Munaton.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the niece magician housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) called himself Friston or Friton,'' said the housekeeper, <div class="bookquote">``I only know that his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) name ended with `ton.'
<p/>So it does,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is a sage magician, a great enemy of mine, who has a spite against me because he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knows by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arts and lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight whom he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) befriends and that I am to conquer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will be unable to prevent it; and for this reason he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) endeavours to do me
<p/>all the ill turns that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) can; but I promise him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) it will be hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to oppose or avoid what is decreed by Heaven.

 (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div><p/>I shall have plucked away and stripped off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.
<p/>'' Oh, niece of mine,'' replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``how much astray art thou in thy reckoning: ere they shear me ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>In short, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) remained at home fifteen days very quietly without showing any signs of a desire to take up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) former delusions, and during this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) held lively discussions with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) two gossips, the curate and the barber, on the point he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) maintained, that knights-errant were what the world stood most in need of, and that in him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was to be accomplished the revival of knight-errantry.
<p/>The curate sometimes contradicted him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), sometimes agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had not observed this precaution he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have been unable to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to reason.
<p/>Meanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), an honest man -LRB-if indeed that title can be given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who is poor-RRB-, but with very little wit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pate.
<p/>In a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) so talked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) over, and with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) mind to sally forth with him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) and serve him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) as esquire.
<p/>Don Quixote, among other things, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ought to be ready to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) gladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in the twinkling of an eye and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) governor of it.
<p/>On these and the like promises Sancho Panza -LRB-for so the labourer was called-RRB- left wife and children, and engaged himself as esquire to his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) neighbour.
<p/>Don Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) got together a fair sum.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) provided himself with a buckler, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) begged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) battered helmet as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) warned his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire Sancho of the day and hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant to set out, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might provide himself with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought most needful.
<p/>The two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) anger was kindling. Above all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to take alforjas with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>The other said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant to take also a very good ass he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was not much given to going on foot.
<p/>About the ass, Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) an esquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) memory.
<p/>For all that, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) determined to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), intending to furnish him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) encountered.
<p/>Himself he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) provided with shirts and such other things as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) could, according to the advice the host had given him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); all which being done, without taking leave, Sancho Panza of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) wife and children, or Don Quixote of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) housekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night, and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.
<p/>Sancho rode on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass like a patriarch, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alforjas and bota, and longing to see himself soon governor of the island his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had taken on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Montiel</b></font>) travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat did not distress them.
<p/>And now said Sancho Panza to his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master, ``Your worship will take care, Senor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me, for be it ever so big
<p/>To which Don Quixote replied, <div class="bookquote">``Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza, that it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires were old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or at the most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thou livest
<p/>, it may well be that before six days are over, I may have won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them.
<p/>Nor needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than I promise thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>In that case,'' said Sancho Panza, <div class="bookquote">``if I should become a king by one of those miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.
<p/>I doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho Panza, <div class="bookquote">``because for my part I am persuaded that though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them would fit the head of Mari Gutierrez.
<p/>Let me tell you, senor, she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) is not worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) better, and that only with God's help.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it to God, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will give her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) what suits her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to be content with anything less than being governor of a province.
<p/>I'll be equal to governing it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and I live '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Well, who doubts it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``specially as I have a man of such quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VIII. OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY TO BE
<p/>At this point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there are on plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire, <div class="bookquote">``Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God's good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>squire</b></font>)</div><p/>FITLY RECORDED <div class="bookquote">``What giants?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho Panza. '' Those thou seest there,'' answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``with the long arms, and some have them nearly two leagues long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``what we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go.
<p/>; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and unequal combat.
<p/>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gave the spur to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) squire Sancho sent after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), warning him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was going to attack.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), however, was so positive they were giants that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor perceived, near as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was, what they were, but made at them shouting, <div class="bookquote">``Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is easy to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that thou art not used to this business of adventures ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Though ye flourish more arms than the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.
<p/>So saying, and commending himself with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea, imploring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) to support him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in such a peril, with lance in rest and covered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) charged at Rocinante's fullest gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition.
<p/>Sancho hastened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) assistance as fast as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass could go, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came up found him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>God bless me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``did I not tell your worship to mind what you were about, for they were only windmills?
<p/>and no one could have made any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, friend Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``the fortunes of war more than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I think, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off my study and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bears me; but in the end his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God order it as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho Panza, and helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) to rise got him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then, discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice, for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare.
<p/>For all that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was much grieved at the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance, and saying so to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de Vargas by name, having broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Vargas</b></font>) sword in battle, tore from an oak a ponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and pounded so many Moors, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vargas</b></font>) got the surname of Machuca, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vargas</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vargas</b></font>) descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca.
<p/>I mention this because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such another branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determined and resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found worthy to come and see them, and be an eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be that as God will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I believe it all as your worship says it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one side, may be from the shaking of the fall.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That is the truth,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and if I make no complaint of the pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of any wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.
<p/>If so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to say; but God knows I would rather your worship complained when anything ailed you.
<p/>For my part, I confess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.
<p/>Don Quixote could not help laughing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire's simplicity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might complain whenever and however he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chose, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) liked, for, so far, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had never read of anything to the contrary in the order of knighthood.
<p/>Sancho bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) remember it was dinner-time, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wanted nothing himself just then, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might eat when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had a mind.
<p/>With this permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beast, and taking out of the alforjas what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had stowed away in them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) jogged along behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master munching deliberately, and from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) never gave a thought to any of the promises his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures, however dangerous they might be.
<p/>Finally they passed the night among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had removed from the broken one.
<p/>Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had read in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless supported by the memory of their mistresses.
<p/>Not so did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) stomach full of something stronger than chicory water he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) made but one sleep of it, and, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master had not called him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), neither the rays of the sun beating on his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>).
<p/>On getting up he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the deficiency readily.
<p/>Don Quixote did not care to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fast, for, as has been already said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) confined himself to savoury recollections for nourishment.
<p/>They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto Lapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it.
<p/>Here, brother Sancho Panza,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw it, <div class="bookquote">``we may plunge our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe, even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case
<p/>if they be knights it is on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' '' '' '' All that night '' thou mayest very properly aid me; but '' Most certainly, senor,'' replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``your worship shall be fully obeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself
<p/>I am peaceful and no friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the defence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any assailant whatever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I grant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``but in this matter of aiding me against knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity.
<p/>While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less tall were the two mules they rode on.
<p/>They wore travelling spectacles and carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot.
<p/>In the coach there was, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way to Seville, where her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an appointment of high honour.
<p/>The friars, though going the same road, were not in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire, <div class="bookquote">``Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo this wrong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>squire</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I will do so, I promise you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and will keep this precept as carefully as Sunday. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This will be worse than the windmills,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho.
<p/>Look, senor; those are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some travellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don't let the devil mislead you.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I have told thee already, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``that on the subject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as thou shalt see presently.
<p/>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along which the friars were coming, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought they had come near enough to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cried aloud, ``Devilish and unnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy death as the just punishment of your evil deeds.
<p/>The friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don Quixote as well as at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) words, to which they replied, <div class="bookquote">``Senor Caballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses coming in this coach.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, and without waiting for a reply he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spurred Rocinante and with levelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule, he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) would have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) to the ground against his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright.
<p/>The second brother, seeing how his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) comrade was treated, drove his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heels into his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the wind.
<p/>Sancho Panza, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ass, rushed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) and began to strip off his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) gown.
<p/>Sancho answered them that this fell to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lawfully as spoil of the battle which his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lord Don Quixote had won.
<p/>The muleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) down, and leaving hardly a hair in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beard, belaboured him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with kicks and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and without any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) found himself in the saddle, spurred after his (<font color='blue'><b>friar</b></font>) companion, who was standing at a distance looking on, watching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil after them.
<p/>'' '' At that instant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was stripping him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) for. Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your beauty, lady mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coach</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``may now dispose of your person as may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your ravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in return for the service you have received of me
<p/>I ask no more than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) what I have done to set you free.
<p/>One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was listening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El Toboso, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) made at him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>), and seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) lance addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) in bad Castilian and worse Biscayan after his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) fashion, ``Begone, caballero, and ill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach, slayest thee as art here a Biscayan.
<p/>Don Quixote understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) quite well, and answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) very quietly, <div class="bookquote">``If thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already chastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.

<p/>The Biscayan, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) coming on, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wished to dismount from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for hire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword; it was lucky for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was near the coach, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was able to snatch a cushion that served him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for a shield; and they went at one another as if they had been two mortal enemies.
<p/>The others strove to make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) disjointed phrase that if they did not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) battle he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would kill his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>The lady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw, ordered the coachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler, which, given to one without armour, would have cleft him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to the waist.
<p/>Don Quixote, feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, <div class="bookquote">``O lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this your knight, who, in fulfilling his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) obligations to your beauty, finds himself in this extreme peril.
<p/>To say this, to lift his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword, to shelter himself well behind his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was the work of an instant, determined as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was to venture all upon a single blow.
<p/>The Biscayan, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) come on in this way, was convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) courage by his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) spirited bearing, and resolved to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) example, so he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) keeping well under cover of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could not stir a step.
<p/>On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan, with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in half, while on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) side the Biscayan waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword in hand, and under the protection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the lady in the coach and the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) following were making a thousand vows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God might deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found themselves.
<p/>But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis the author of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as excuse that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) could find nothing more written about these achievements of Don Quixote than what has been already set forth.
<p/>It is true the second author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight; and this being his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) persuasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven favouring him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did find in a way that shall be related in the Second Part.
<p/>otherwise thou liest. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER IX. IN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THE GALLANT BISCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGAN
<p/>In the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the renowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two such furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they would at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the delightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any intimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.
<p/>This distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having read such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chance that presented itself of finding the large part that, so it seemed to me, was missing of such an interesting tale.
<p/>It appeared to me to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task of writing his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) marvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting to any of those knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for every one of them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only recorded their deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies, however secret they might be; and such a good knight could not have been so unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had in abundance.
<p/>And so I could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant tale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time, the devourer and destroyer of all things, that had either concealed or consumed it.
<p/>On the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) books there had been found such modern ones as <div class="bookquote">``The Enlightenment of Jealousy''  (<font color='red'><b>ones</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares,''  (<font color='red'><b>ones</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) story must likewise be modern, and that though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of the people of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) village and of those in the neighbourhood.
<p/>This reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote of La Mancha, light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first that in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise of the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and protecting damsels of that sort that used to ride about, whip in hand, on their palfreys, with all their virginity about them, from mountain to mountain and valley to valley--for, if it were not for some ruffian, or boor with a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced them, there were in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years, in all which time they had never slept a day under a roof, went to their graves as much maids as the mothers that bore them.
<p/>I say, then, that in these and other respects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise, nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I know well that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, the world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who shall read it attentively.
<p/>One day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some pamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading even the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent of mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw that it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was unable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to see if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even had I sought one for an older and better language I should have found him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>).
<p/>In short, chance provided me with one, who when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) what I wanted and put the book into his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a little in it began to laugh.
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) was laughing at, and he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) replied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by way of a note.
<p/>I bade him (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) tell it to me; and he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) still laughing said, ``In the margin, as I told you, this is written: `This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for salting pigs.'
<p/>When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and amazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained the history of Don Quixote.
<p/>With this idea I pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to read the beginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) told me it meant, ``History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cide Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian.
<p/>It required great caution to hide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatching it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wits about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and had known how eager I was for them, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might have safely calculated on making more than six reals by the bargain.
<p/>I withdrew at once with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) whatever payment he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pleased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to my house, where in little more than a month and a half he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) translated the whole just as it is set down here.
<p/>In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the history describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler, the other by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cushion, and the Biscayan's mule so true to nature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off.
<p/>The Biscayan had an inscription under his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet which said, <div class="bookquote">``Don Sancho de Azpeitia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biscayan</b></font>)</div>which no doubt must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) name; and at the feet of Rocinante was another that said, ``Don Quixote.
<p/>Rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long and thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in consumption, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Near him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was Sancho Panza holding the halter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ass, at whose feet was another label that said, <div class="bookquote">``Sancho Zancas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and according to the picture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) must have had a big belly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza and Zancas were given him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), for by these two surnames the history several times calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>).
<p/>Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the true relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as it is true.
<p/>If against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its truth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very common propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such enemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than additions made in the course of it.
<p/>And this is my own opinion; for, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) could and should give freedom to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) pen in praise of so worthy a knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arab</b></font>) seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business and duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from passion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them swerve from the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel for the present, and warning for the future.
<p/>In this I know will be found all that can be desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting in any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault of the subject.
<p/>To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation, began in this way: With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though the two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and earth, and hell, with such resolution and determination
<p/>The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the bitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good fortune which reserved him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) for greater things, turned aside the sword of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) adversary, so that although it smote him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) upon the left shoulder, it did him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour, carrying away a great part of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) helmet with half of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ear,
<p/>The discovery of it occurred in this way. '' '' '' did they bear themselves. all which with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in a sorry plight.
<p/>Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled the heart of our Manchegan when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw himself dealt with in this fashion?
<p/>All that can be said is, it was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) again raised himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) stirrups, and, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword more firmly with both hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) full over the cushion and over the head, that--even so good a shield proving useless--as if a mountain had fallen on him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) began to bleed from nose, mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mule,
<p/>as no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have done had he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) not flung his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) arms about its neck; at the same time, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) feet out of the stirrups and then unclasped his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow, made off across the plain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the ground.
<p/>Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fall, leaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse and with great briskness ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and, presenting the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes, bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) surrender, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head off.
<p/>The Biscayan was so bewildered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was unable to answer a word, and it would have gone hard with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), so blind was Don Quixote,
<p/>had not the ladies in the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in great terror, hastened to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stood and implored him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with earnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their squire's life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and dignity, <div class="bookquote">``In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of me; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is that this knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my behalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) as shall be most pleasing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>).
<p/>The terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote's demand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire should do all that had been commanded.
<p/>Then, on the faith of that promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I shall do him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) no further harm, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) well deserves it of me.
<p/>Good God! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' CHAPTER X. OF THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA
<p/>Now by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling of the friars' muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, Don Quixote, and praying to God in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart that it might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will to grant him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the victory, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might thereby win some island to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) governor of, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had promised.
<p/>Seeing, therefore, that the struggle was now over, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master was returning to mount Rocinante, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) approached to hold the stirrup for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could mount, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knees before him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand, kissed it saying, ``May it please your worship, Senor Don Quixote, to give me the government of that island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big I feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as well as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands.
<p/>To which Don Quixote replied, <div class="bookquote">``Thou must take notice, brother Sancho, that this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands, but of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear the less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves from which I may make you, not only a governor, but something more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Sancho gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) many thanks, and again kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand and the skirt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hauberk, helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to mount Rocinante, and mounting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass himself, proceeded to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, who at a brisk pace, without taking leave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach, turned into a wood that was hard by.
<p/>Sancho followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass's best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was forced to call to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>Don Quixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) weary squire came up, who on reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me, senor, it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it.''

<p/>Let your worship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads, nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wear helmets, but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How little thou knowest about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``I would have thee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go without eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should be of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee hadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, though they are very many, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant eating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance.
<p/>And though it is plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other natural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it is plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives through woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would be rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend Sancho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to make a new world or pervert knight-errantry.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not say, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``that it is imperative on knights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs they found in the fields which they knew

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' and I know too.'' '' And here taking out what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had brought, the pair made their repast peaceably and sociably.
<p/>But anxious to find quarters for the night, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted at once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night set in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there, and it was as much to Sancho's discontent not to have reached a house, as it was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancied that each time this happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) performed an act of ownership that helped to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) chivalry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that came from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be transferred from the pot to the stomach, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) refrained from doing so as the goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the ground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty good-will invited them both to share what they had.
<p/>Round the skins six of the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with rough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they placed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) upside down.
<p/>CHAPTER XI. WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho remained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn.
<p/>Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) standing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains in itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people, and that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and that thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for the same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but I may tell your worship that provided I have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by myself, than seated alongside of an emperor.
<p/>And indeed, if the truth is to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much more relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the turkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink little, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I want or do other things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude.
<p/>So, senor, as for these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for other things which may be of more use and advantage to me; for these, though I fully acknowledge them as received, I renounce from this moment to the end of the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``thou must seat thyself, because him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who humbleth himself God exalteth;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) by the arm he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forced him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to sit down beside himself.
<p/>The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and knights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as big as one's fist.
<p/>The course of meat finished, they spread upon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they put down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar.
<p/>All this while the horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now full, now empty, like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained one of the two wine-skins that were in sight.
<p/>When Don Quixote had quite appeased his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) appetite he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took up a handful of the acorns, and contemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat in this fashion: ``Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of golden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this our iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it knew not the two words <div class="bookquote">``mine''  (<font color='red'><b>the ancients</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``thine'' (<font color='red'><b>the ancients</b></font>)</div>!
<p/>In that blessed age all things were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to stretch forth his (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood generously inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) with their sweet ripe fruit.
<p/>The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering without usance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand.
<p/>The mighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the broad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by rude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone.
<p/>Then all was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of the crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels of our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight the children that then possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Then was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with flowing locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide.
<p/>Nor were their ornaments like those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured in endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy, wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames with all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has taught them.
<p/>Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselves simply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commend themselves by forced and rambling verbiage.
<p/>The clear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble abundance. Fraud, deceit, or malice had then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity.
<p/>Justice held her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) ground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of interest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).
<p/>Arbitrary law had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then there was no cause to judge and no one to be judged.
<p/>Maidens and modesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were undone it was of their own will and pleasure.
<p/>But now in this hateful age of ours not one is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of Crete conceal and surround her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); even there the pestilence of gallantry will make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of its accursed importunity, and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to ruin.
<p/>In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy.
<p/>To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by natural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power I should thank you for yours.
<p/>All this long harangue -LRB-which might very well have been spared-RRB- our knight delivered because the acorns they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of the golden age; and the whim seized him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to address all this unnecessary argument to the goatherds, who listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) gaping in amazement without saying a word in reply.
<p/>Sancho likewise held his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) peace and ate acorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which they had hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.
<p/>Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the end of which one of the goatherds said, ``That your worship, senor knight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of our comrades sing: he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will be here before long, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is a very intelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) can read and write and play on the rebeck to perfection.
<p/>The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck reached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very good-looking young man of about two-and-twenty.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comrades asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had supped, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who had already made the offer said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in the mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) of thy accomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say true; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much liked in the town.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, and without waiting for more pressing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rebeck, presently began to sing to these words.
<p/>'' '' ANTONIO'S BALLAD Thou dost love me well, Olalla; Well I know it, even though Love's mute tongues, thine eyes, have never
<p/>For I know my love thou knowest, Therefore thine to claim I dare: Once it ceases to be secret, Love need never feel despair.
<p/>By their glances told me so. True it is, Olalla , sometimes Thou hast all too plainly shown That thy heart is brass in hardness, And thy snowy bosom stone.
<p/>Yet for all that, in thy coyness, And thy fickle fits between, Hope is there--at least the border Of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) garment may be seen.
<p/>Lures to faith are they, those glimpses, And to faith in thee I hold; Kindness cannot make it stronger , Coldness cannot make it cold.
<p/>If it be that love is gentle, In thy gentleness I see Something holding out assurance To the hope of winning thee.
<p/>If it be that in devotion Lies a power hearts to move, That which every day I show thee, Helpful to my suit should prove.
<p/>Many a time thou must have noticed-- If to notice thou dost care-- How I go about on Monday Dressed in all my Sunday wear.
<p/>Love's eyes love to look on brightness; Love loves what is gaily drest; Sunday, Monday, all I care is Thou shouldst see me in my best.
<p/>No account I make of dances, Or of strains that pleased thee so, Keeping thee awake from midnight Till the cocks began to crow;
<p/>Or of how I roundly swore it That there's none so fair as thou; True it is, but as I said it,
<p/>At my praise of thee was sore; Said, ``You think you love an angel; It's a monkey you adore; <div class="bookquote">``Caught by all her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) glittering trinkets, And her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) borrowed braids of hair, And a host of made-up beauties That would Love himself ensnare.
<p/>By the girls I'm hated now. For Teresa of the hillside ''  (<font color='red'><b>a monkey</b></font>)</div>'T was a lie, and so I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>),
<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) cousin at the word Gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) defiance for it; And what followed thou hast heard. Mine is no high-flown affection, Mine no passion
<p/>par amours-- As they call it--what I offer Is an honest love, and pure. Cunning cords the holy Church has, Cords of softest silk they be
<p/>; Put thy neck beneath the yoke, dear; Mine will follow, thou wilt see. Else--and once for all I swear it By the saint of most renown--
<p/>Here the goatherd brought his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) song to an end, and though Don Quixote entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more inclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, ``Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them to spend the night in singing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand thee, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``I perceive clearly that those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather than in music.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>If I ever quit the mountains, 'T will be in a friar's gown. '' '' It's sweet to us all, blessed be God,'' said Sancho.
<p/>I do not deny it,'' replied Don Quixote; ``but settle thyself where thou wilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than in sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.
<p/>Sancho did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) not to be uneasy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would apply a remedy with which it would be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which there was a great quantity there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) chewed them and mixed them with a little salt, and applying them to the ear he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) secured them firmly with a bandage, assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that no other treatment would be required, and so it proved.
<p/>Just then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisions from the village, came up and said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you know what is going on in the village, comrades?''
 (<font color='red'><b>another man</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' CHAPTER XII. OF WHAT A GOATHERD RELATED TO THOSE WITH DON QUIXOTE <div class="bookquote">``How could we know it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied one of them.
<p/>Well, then, you must know,'' continued the young man, <div class="bookquote">``this morning that famous student-shepherd called Chrysostom died, and it is rumoured that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of Guillermo the Rich, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that wanders about the wolds here in the dress of a shepherdess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>I mean,'' answered the goatherd; <div class="bookquote">``and the best of it is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) has directed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) will that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) is to be buried in the fields like a Moor, and at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is, because, as the story goes -LRB-and they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) himself said so-RRB-
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) has also left other directions which the clergy of the village say should not and must not be obeyed because they savour of paganism.
<p/>To all which his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) great friend Ambrosio the student, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) who, like him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>), also went dressed as a shepherd, replies that everything must be done without any omission according to the directions left by Chrysostom, and about this the village is all in commotion; however, report says that, after all, what Ambrosio and all the shepherds his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) friends desire will be done, and to-morrow they are coming to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) with great ceremony where I said.
<p/>I am sure it will be something worth seeing; at least I will not fail to go and see it even if I knew I should not return to the village to-morrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will do the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the goatherds, <div class="bookquote">``and cast lots to see who must stay to mind the goats of all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div><p/>Thou sayest well, Pedro,'' said one, <div class="bookquote">``though there will be no need of taking that trouble, for I will stay behind for all; and don't suppose it is virtue or want of curiosity in me
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div>'' You mean Marcela?'' said one. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) , that was the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>). '' ; it is that the splinter that ran into my foot the other day will not let me walk.''
<p/>Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who the dead man was and who the shepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) knew was that the dead man was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains, who had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) village with the reputation of being very learned and deeply read.
<p/>Above all, they said, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was learned in the science of the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and the moon, for he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact time.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two luminaries,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with trifles, went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) story, saying, ``Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) foretold when the year was going to be one of abundance or estility.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For all that, we thank thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div>answered Pedro. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Sterility, you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' Sterility or estility,'' answered Pedro, <div class="bookquote">``it is all the same in the end.
<p/>And I can tell you that by this his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) father and friends who believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) grew very rich because they did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) advised them, bidding them `sow barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow pulse and not barley; the next there will be a full oil crop, and the three following not a drop will be got.'
<p/>I do not know what it is called,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div>replied Pedro, <div class="bookquote">``but I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) knew all this and more besides.
<p/>But, to make an end, not many months had passed after he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) returned from Salamanca, when one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) appeared dressed as a shepherd with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) crook and sheepskin, having put off the long gown he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) wore as a scholar; and at the same time his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) great friend, Ambrosio by name, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) companion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) studies, took to the shepherd's dress with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>).
<p/>I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is dead, was a great man for writing verses, so much so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made carols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young men of our village acted, and all said they were excellent.
<p/>When the villagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd's dress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change.
<p/>About this time the father of our Chrysostom died, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was left heir to a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a large sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissolute owner, and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was deserving of it all, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a very good comrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had a countenance like a benediction.
<p/>Presently it came to be known that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dress with no other object than to wander about these wastes after that shepherdess
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div>'' That science is called astrology,'' said Don Quixote. '' Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago, with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love.
<p/>perhaps, and even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it all the days of your life, though you should live more years than sarna.''
<p/>And I must tell you now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; <div class="bookquote">``Say Sarra,''  (<font color='red'><b>this girl</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd's confusion of words.
<p/>The sarna lives long enough,'' answered Pedro; <div class="bookquote">``and if, senor, you must go finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of it this twelvemonth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``but, as there is such a difference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have answered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue your story, and I will not object any more to anything.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say then, my dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div>said the goatherd, <div class="bookquote">``that in our village there was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was named Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great wealth, a daughter at whose birth her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother died, the most respected woman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) now with that countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the other; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust that at the present moment her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) soul is in bliss with God in the other world.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Guillermo</b></font>) daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village.
<p/>The girl grew up with such beauty that it reminded us of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's, which was very great, and yet it was thought that the daughter's would exceed it; and so when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) but blessed God that had made her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) past redemption.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) uncle kept her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in great seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) great beauty spread so that, as well for it as for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) great wealth, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) uncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in marriage not only by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), being a good Christian man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) desired to give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in marriage at once, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to be old enough, was unwilling to do so without her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) consent, not that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had any eye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl's property brought him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) put off her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town.
<p/>For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forces his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) parishioners to speak well of him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), especially in villages.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div><p/>That is the truth,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but go on, for the story is very good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' May that of the Lord not be wanting to me,'' said Pedro; ``that is the one to have.
<p/>To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) niece and described to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) the qualities of each one in particular of the many who had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) in marriage, begging her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to marry and make a choice according to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) own taste, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) never gave any other answer than that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so young she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony.
<p/>At these, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) made, her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle ceased to urge her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and waited till she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) own liking.
<p/>For, said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said quite right--parents are not to settle children in life against their will. But when one least looked for it, lo and behold!
<p/>one day the demure Marcela makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>), took to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village, and tending her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) own flock.
<p/>And so, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) appeared in public, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how many rich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume of Chrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>).
<p/>One of these, as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they say that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not love but adore her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>).
<p/>But you must not suppose, because Marcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so little or rather no retirement, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) has given any occasion, or even the semblance of one, for disparagement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) purity and modesty; on the contrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) watches over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) honour, that of all those that court and woo her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) not one has boasted, or can with truth boast, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) has given him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) any hope however small of obtaining his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) desire.
<p/>For although she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the shepherds, and treats them courteously and kindly, should any one of them come to declare his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) intention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>), though it be one as proper and holy as that of matrimony, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) flings him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) like a catapult.
<p/>And with this kind of disposition she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) does more harm in this country than if the plague had got into it, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) affability and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) beauty
<p/>draw on the hearts of those that associate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) and to court her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) scorn and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so they know not what to say save to proclaim her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) aloud cruel and hard-hearted, and other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) character; and
<p/>if you should remain here any time, senor, you would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the rejected ones who pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>).
<p/>Not far from this there is a spot where there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of them but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela, and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) lover would say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty.
<p/>One will pass all the hours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there, without having closed his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) weeping eyes, the sun finds him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in the morning bemused and bereft of sense; and another without relief or respite to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sighs, stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer noontide, makes his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) appeal to the compassionate heavens, and over one and the other, over these and all, the beautiful Marcela triumphs free and careless.
<p/>And all of us that know her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) are waiting to see what her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) pride will come to, and who is to be the happy man that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gaining possession of a beauty so supreme.
<p/>All that I have told you being such well-established truth, I am persuaded that what they say of the cause of Chrysostom's death, as our lad told us, is the same.
<p/>And so I advise you, senor, fail not to be present to-morrow at his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) burial, which will be well worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends, and it is not half a league from this place to where he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) directed he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) should be buried.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will make a point of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and I thank you for the pleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh,'' said the goatherd, <div class="bookquote">``I do not know even the half of what has happened to the lovers of Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in with some shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be well for you to go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your wound, though with the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear of an untoward result.
<p/>Sancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd's loquacity at the devil, on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) part begged his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) master to go into Pedro's hut to sleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) did so, and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) lady Dulcinea, in imitation of the lovers of Marcela.
<p/>Sancho Panza settled himself between Rocinante and his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been discarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.
<p/>Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there love songs are heard, here despairing elegies. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div>'' '' CHAPTER XIII.
<p/>THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS MARCELA, WITH OTHER INCIDENTS Bit hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the east, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of Chrysostom they would bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) company.
<p/>Don Quixote, who desired nothing better, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did with all despatch, and with the same they all set out forthwith.
<p/>They had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter oleander.
<p/>Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand, and along with them there came two men of quality on horseback in handsome travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying them.
<p/>Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring one of the other which way each party was going, they learned that all were bound for the scene of the burial, so they went on all together.
<p/>One of those on horseback addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) companion said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me, Senor Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay we shall incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable
<p/>it cannot but be judging by the strange things these shepherds have told us, of both the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>So I think too,'' replied Vivaldo, <div class="bookquote">``and I would delay not to say a day, but four, for the sake of seeing it.
<p/>The traveller answered that the same morning they had met these shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they had asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one of them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a shepherdess called Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>), together with the death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they were going.
<p/>IN WHICH IS ENDED ''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivaldo</b></font>)</div>'' Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela and Chrysostom. In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.
<p/>This conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who was called Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to go armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful.
<p/>To which Don Quixote replied, <div class="bookquote">``The pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented for soft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made for those alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though unworthy, am the least of all.
<p/>The instant they heard this all set him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) down as mad, and the better to settle the point and discover what kind of madness his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was, Vivaldo proceeded to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what knights-errant meant.
<p/>Have not your worships,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``read the annals and histories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of King Arthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus, with regard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received all over that kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, but was changed by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is to return to reign and recover his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) kingdom and sceptre
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' ; for which reason it cannot be proved that from that time to this any Englishman ever killed a raven?
<p/>Well, then, in the time of this good king that famous order of chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table was instituted, and the amour of Don Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen Guinevere occurred, precisely as is there related, the go-between and confidante therein being the highly honourable dame
<p/>Quintanona, whence came that ballad so well known and widely spread in our Spain-- O never surely was there knight So served by hand of dame,
<p/>As served was he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) Sir Lancelot hight When he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) from Britain came-- with all the sweet and delectable course of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) achievements in love and war.
<p/>Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry went on extending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the world; and in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mighty Amadis of Gaul with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) sons and descendants to the fifth generation, and the valiant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the never sufficiently praised Tirante el Blanco, and in our own days almost we have seen and heard and talked with the invincible knight Don Belianis of Greece.
<p/>This, then, sirs, is to be a knight-errant, and what I have spoken of is the order of his (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) chivalry, of which, as I have already said, I, though a sinner, have made profession, and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do I profess, and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking adventures, resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy.
<p/>By these words of his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of Don Quixote's being out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) senses and of the form of madness that overmastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt on first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was a person of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to beguile the short journey which they said was required to reach the mountain, the scene of the burial, sought to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) an opportunity of going on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) absurdities.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me, Senor Knight-errant, that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions in the world, and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not so austere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``As austere it may perhaps be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied our Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but so necessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt.
<p/>For, if the truth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) captain orders does no less than the captain himself who gives the order.
<p/>My meaning, is, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of the world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray for, defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords, not under shelter but in the open air, a target for the intolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter.
<p/>And as the business of war and all that relates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding great sweat, toil, and exertion, it follows that those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak.
<p/>I do not mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts, that the knight-errant's calling is as good as that of the monk in his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) cell; I would merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and thirstier, a wretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to doubt that the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their lives.
<p/>And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be emperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat; and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages to help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition and disappointed in their hopes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>That is my own opinion,'' replied the traveller; <div class="bookquote">``but one thing among many others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is that when they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous adventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they never at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to God, as is the duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead of which they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if these were their gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of heathenism.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that cannot be on any account omitted, and the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is usual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on engaging in any great feat of arms has his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady before him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), should turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes towards her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) softly and lovingly, as though with them entreating her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to favour and protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the hazardous venture he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is about to undertake, and even though no one hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is bound to say certain words between his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) teeth, commending himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart, and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories.
<p/>Nor is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending themselves to God, for there will be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>answered the traveller, <div class="bookquote">``I feel some doubt still, because often I have read how words will arise between two knights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field, and then without any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the haunches of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) horse pierced through and through by his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) antagonist's lance, and as for the other, it is only by holding on to the mane of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) horse that he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) can help falling to the ground; but I know not how the dead man had time to commend himself to God in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been better if those words which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spent in commending himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lady in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) career had been devoted to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) duty and obligation as a Christian.
<p/>Moreover, it is my belief that all knights-errant have not ladies to commend themselves to, for they are not all in love.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div><p/>That is impossible,'' said Don Quixote: <div class="bookquote">``I say it is impossible that there could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a knight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that without one he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who had gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by the door, but over the wall like a thief and a robber.
<p/>Thus are we God's ministers on earth and the arms by which his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) justice is done therein. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' ''
<p/>Nevertheless,'' said the traveller, ``if I remember rightly, I think I have read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul, never had any special lady to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) might commend himself,
<p/>To which our Don Quixote made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Sir, one solitary swallow does not make summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeply in love; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fancy was a natural propensity which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) could not control.
<p/>But, in short, it is very manifest that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had one alone whom he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) made mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) commended himself very frequently and very secretly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) prided himself on being a reticent knight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>said the traveller, ``it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so, as you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as reticent as Don Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the name of all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name, country, rank, and beauty of your lady, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will esteem herself fortunate if all the world knows that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is loved and served by such a knight as your worship seems to be.
<p/>At this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot say positively whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know I serve her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); I can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked of me, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name is Dulcinea, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) country El Toboso, a village of La Mancha, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rank must be at least that of a princess, since she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is my queen and lady, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hairs are gold, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead Elysian fields, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyebrows rainbows, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes suns, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheeks roses, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips coral, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) teeth pearls, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neck alabaster, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bosom marble, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands ivory, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight such, I think and imagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not compare.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``We should like to know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lineage, race, and ancestry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivaldo</b></font>)</div>said Vivaldo.
<p/>To which Don Quixote replied, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not of the ancient Roman Curtii, Caii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of the Moncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas or Villanovas of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas, Alagones, Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques, Mendozas, or Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses of Portugal; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage that though modern, may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most illustrious families of the ages that are to come, and this let none dispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino placed at the foot of the trophy of Orlando's arms, saying, `These let none move Who dareth not his (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) might with Roland prove.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo,'' said the traveller, ``I will not venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha, though, to tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reached my ears.
<p/>The rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the conversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherds perceived how exceedingly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) wits our Don Quixote was.
<p/>Sancho Panza alone thought that what his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master said was the truth, knowing who he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was and having known him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) birth; and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) felt any difficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del Toboso, because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) knowledge though he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) lived so close to El Toboso.
<p/>They were going along conversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap between two high mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in sheepskins of black wool, and crowned with garlands which, as afterwards appeared, were, some of them of yew, some of cypress.
<p/>Six of the number were carrying a bier covered with a great variety of flowers and branches, on seeing which one of the goatherds said, ``Those who come there are the bearers of Chrysostom's body, and the foot of that mountain is the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Chrysostom</b></font>) ordered them to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Chrysostom</b></font>).
<p/>They therefore made haste to reach the spot, and did so by the time those who came had laid the bier upon the ground, and four of them with sharp pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of a hard rock.
<p/>They greeted each other courteously, and then Don Quixote and those who accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) turned to examine the bier, and on it, covered with flowers, they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to all appearance of one thirty years of age, and showing even in death that in life he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) had been of comely features and gallant bearing.
<p/>Around him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) on the bier itself were laid some books, and several papers open and folded; and those who were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave and all the others who were there preserved a strange silence, until one of those who had borne the body said to another, <div class="bookquote">``Observe carefully, Ambrosia if this is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious that what he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) directed in his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) will should be so strictly complied with.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>This is the place,'' answered Ambrosia <div class="bookquote">``for in it many a time did my poor friend tell me the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hard fortune.
<p/>Here it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race, and here, too, for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) declared to her (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) passion, as honourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcela ended by scorning and rejecting him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so as to bring the tragedy of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wretched life to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) desired to be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Then turning to Don Quixote and the travellers he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``That body, sirs, on which you are looking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soul on which Heaven bestowed a vast share of its riches.
<p/>That is the body of Chrysostom, who was unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy, unapproached in gentle bearing, a phoenix in friendship, generous without limit, grave without arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in short, first in all that constitutes goodness and second to none in all that makes up misfortune.
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) adored, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was scorned; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wooed a wild beast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pleaded with marble, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pursued the wind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cried to the wilderness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) served ingratitude, and for reward was made the prey of death in the mid-course of life, cut short by a shepherdess whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sought to immortalise in the memory of man, as these papers which you see could fully prove, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) not commanded me to consign them to the fire after having consigned his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) body to the earth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivaldo</b></font>)</div>said Vivaldo, <div class="bookquote">``for it is neither right nor proper to do the will of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not have been reasonable in Augustus Caesar
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivaldo</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivaldo</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``has that never reached them? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) loved deeply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was hated had he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) permitted the directions left by the divine Mantuan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will to be carried into effect.
<p/>So that, Senor Ambrosia while you consign your friend's body to the earth, you should not consign his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) writings to oblivion, for if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gave the order in bitterness of heart, it is not right that you should irrationally obey it.
<p/>On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let the cruelty of Marcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of us who have come here know already the story of this your love-stricken and heart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) death, and the directions he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gave at the close of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of Marcela, the love of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship, together with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens to their eyes.
<p/>Last night we learned the death of Chrysostom and that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was to be buried here, and out of curiosity and pity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyes that which when heard of had so moved our compassion, and in consideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we might by condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosia, or at least I on my own account entreat you, that
<p/>And without waiting for the shepherd's answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) hand and took up some of those that were nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>); seeing which Ambrosio said, ``Out of courtesy, senor, I will grant your request as to those you have taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain from burning the remainder.
<p/>Vivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one of them at once, and saw that its title was ``Lay of Despair.
<p/>Ambrosio hearing it said, ``That is the last paper the unhappy man wrote; and that you may see, senor, to what an end his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misfortunes brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), read it so that you may be heard, for you will have time enough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do so very willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivaldo</b></font>)</div>said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanders were equally eager they gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), reading in a loud voice, found that it ran as follows.
<p/>instead of burning those papers you allow me to carry away some of them. '' '' '' '' CHAPTER XIV. WHEREIN ARE INSERTED THE DESPAIRING VERSES OF THE DEAD SHEPHERD,
<p/>The ruthless rigour of thy tyranny From tongue to tongue, from land to land proclaimed, The very Hell will I constrain to lend This stricken breast of mine deep notes of woe
<p/>TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS NOT LOOKED FOR THE LAY OF CHRYSOSTOM Since thou dost in thy cruelty desire To serve my need of fitting utterance.
<p/>And as I strive to body forth the tale Of all I suffer, all that thou hast done, Forth shall the dread voice roll, and bear along Shreds from my vitals torn for greater pain.
<p/>But to a discord wrung by mad despair Out of this bosom's depths of bitterness, To ease my heart and plant a sting in thine.
<p/>The lion's roar, the fierce wolf's savage howl, The horrid hissing of the scaly snake, The awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed, The crow's ill-boding croak, the hollow moan Of wild winds wrestling with the restless sea, The wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull, The plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove, The envied owl's sad note, the wail of woe
<p/>That rises from the dreary choir of Hell, Commingled in one sound, confusing sense, Let all these come to aid my soul's complaint, For pain like mine demands new modes of song.
<p/>No echoes of that discord shall be heard Where Father Tagus rolls, or on the banks Of olive-bordered Betis; to the rocks
<p/>Or in deep caverns shall my plaint be told, And by a lifeless tongue in living words; Or in dark valleys or on lonely shores, Where neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls; Or in among the poison-breathing swarms Of monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile.
<p/>The hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows sound Thy matchless cruelty, my dismal fate Shall carry them to all the spacious world.
<p/>Disdain hath power to kill, and patience dies Slain by suspicion, be it false or true; And deadly is the force of jealousy; Long absence makes of life a dreary void; No hope of happiness can give repose To him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) that ever fears to be forgot; And death, inevitable, waits in hall.
<p/>Then listen, not to dulcet harmony, For, though it be to solitudes remote But I, by some strange miracle, live on A prey to absence, jealousy, disdain;
<p/>Racked by suspicion as by certainty; Forgotten, left to feed my flame alone. And while I suffer thus, there comes no ray Of hope to gladden me athwart the gloom;
<p/>Nor do I look for it in my despair; But rather clinging to a cureless woe, All hope do I abjure for evermore.
<p/>Can there be hope where fear is? Were it well, When far more certain are the grounds of fear? Ought I to shut mine eyes to jealousy,
<p/>Who would not give free access to distrust, Seeing disdain unveiled, and--bitter change!-- All his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) suspicions turned to certainties, And the fair truth transformed into a lie?
<p/>If through a thousand heart-wounds it appears? Oh, thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love, Oh, Jealousy! put chains upon these hands, And bind me with thy strongest cord, Disdain.
<p/>And now I die, and since there is no hope Of happiness for me in life or death, Still to my fantasy I'll fondly cling.
<p/>I'll say that he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) is wise who loveth well, And that the soul most free is that most bound In thraldom to the ancient tyrant Love.
<p/>But, woe is me! triumphant over all, My sufferings drown the memory of you. I'll say that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) who is mine enemy
<p/>In that fair body hath as fair a mind, And that her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) coldness is but my desert, And that by virtue of the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) sends Love rules his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) kingdom with a gentle sway.
<p/>Thus, self-deluding, and in bondage sore, And wearing out the wretched shred of life To which I am reduced by her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) disdain, I'll give this soul and body to the winds, All hopeless of a crown of bliss in store.
<p/>Thou whose injustice hath supplied the cause That makes me quit the weary life I loathe, As by this wounded bosom thou canst see How willingly thy victim
<p/>Let not my death, if haply worth a tear, Cloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy bright eyes; I would not have thee expiate in aught
<p/>The crime of having made my heart thy prey; But rather let thy laughter gaily ring And prove my death to be thy festival.
<p/>And now it is the time; from Hell's abyss Come thirsting Tantalus, come Sisyphus Heaving the cruel stone, come Tityus With vulture, and with wheel Ixion come, And come the sisters of the ceaseless toil; And all into this breast transfer their pains,
<p/>And -LRB-if such tribute to despair be due-RRB- Chant in their deepest tones a doleful dirge Over a corse unworthy of a shroud.
<p/>Let the three-headed guardian of the gate, And all the monstrous progeny of hell, The doleful concert join: a lover dead Methinks can have no fitter obsequies.
<p/>I become, Fool that I am to bid thee! well I know Thy glory gains by my untimely end. Lay of despair, grieve not when thou art gone Forth from this sorrowing heart:
<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``Lay of Chrysostom''  (<font color='red'><b>Lay grieve art</b></font>)</div>met with the approbation of the listeners, though the reader said it did not seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) to agree with what he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had heard of Marcela's reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained in it of jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of the good name and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one who knew well his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) friend's most secret thoughts, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, to remove that doubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was away from Marcela, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had voluntarily separated himself, to try if absence would act with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as it is wont; and as everything distresses and every fear haunts the banished lover, so imaginary jealousies and suspicions, dreaded as if they were true, tormented Chrysostom; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue of Marcela remains unshaken, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) envy itself should not and cannot find any fault save that of being cruel, somewhat haughty, and very scornful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vivaldo</b></font>)</div>said Vivaldo; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was about to read another paper of those he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had preserved from the fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was stopped by a marvellous vision -LRB-for such it seemed-RRB- that unexpectedly presented itself to their eyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave there appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) beauty exceeded its reputation.
<p/>Those who had never till then beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) gazed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) were not less amazed than those who had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) before.
<p/>But the instant Ambrosio saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>), with manifest indignation: <div class="bookquote">``Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if in thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being thy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work of thy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to look down from that height upon the ruin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) Rome in embers; or in thy arrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful daughter trampled on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father Tarquin's?
<p/>Tell us quickly for what thou art come, or what it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know the thoughts of Chrysostom never failed to obey thee in life, I will make all these who call themselves his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends obey thee, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) be dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I come not, Ambrosia for any of the purposes thou hast named,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marcela</b></font>)</div>replied Marcela, ``but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all those who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom's death; and therefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to persons of sense.
<p/>Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so much so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and for the love you show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound to love you.
<p/>my misery Brings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth; Then banish sadness even in the tomb. By that natural understanding which God has given me
<p/>I know that everything beautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, by reason of being loved, that which is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it; besides, it may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness being detestable, it is very absurd to say, <div class="bookquote">``I love thee because thou art beautiful, thou must love me though I be ugly.
<p/>But supposing the beauty equal on both sides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore alike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but pleasing the eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beauty excited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of beautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and true love, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and not compelled.
<p/>If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire me to bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say you love me?
<p/>Nay--tell me--had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made me beautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me?
<p/>Moreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice of mine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me without my asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it, does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a gift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for beauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword; the one does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not come too near.
<p/>Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, without which the body, though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful; but if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and body, why should she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who is loved for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty part with it to gratify one who for his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pleasure alone strives with all his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might and energy to rob her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of it?
<p/>I chose the solitude of the fields; in the trees of the mountains I find society, the clear waters of the brooks are my mirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts and charms.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>I was born free, and that I might live in freedom I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside.
<p/>Those whom I have inspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words undeceived, and if their longings live on hope--and I have given none to Chrysostom or to any other--it cannot justly be said that the death of any is my doing, for it was rather his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own obstinacy than my cruelty that killed him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>); and if it be made a charge against me that his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wishes were honourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, I answer that when on this very spot where now his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) grave is made he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) declared to me his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) purity of purpose, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) that mine was to live in perpetual solitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of my retirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what wonder is it that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) should sink in the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) infatuation?
<p/>If I had encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), I should be false; if I had gratified him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), I should have acted against my own better resolution and purpose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was persistent in spite of warning, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) despaired without being hated. Bethink you now if it be reasonable that his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) suffering should be laid to my charge.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) who has been deceived complain, let him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) give way to despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) flatter himself whom I shall entice, let him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) boast whom I shall receive; but let not him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) call me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, upon whom I practise no deception, whom I neither entice nor receive.
<p/>It has not been so far the will of Heaven that I should love by fate, and to expect me to love by choice is idle.
<p/>Let this general declaration serve for each of my suitors on his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own account, and let it be understood from this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy or misery he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) dies, for she (<font color='blue'><b>suitors</b></font>) who loves no one can give no cause for jealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded with scorn.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) who calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone as something noxious and evil; let him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) who calls me ungrateful, withhold his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) service; who calls me wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls me cruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast, this basilisk, this ungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no kind of desire to seek, serve, know, or follow them.
<p/>If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it?
<p/>I have, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of others; my taste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I neither love nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, or trifle with one or play with another.
<p/>The modest converse of the shepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my recreations; my desires are bounded by these mountains, and if they ever wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, steps by which the soul travels to its primeval abode.
<p/>With these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) turned and passed into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving all who were there lost in admiration as much of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) good sense as of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) beauty.
<p/>Some--those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bright eyes--made as though they would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), heedless of the frank declaration they had heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fitting occasion for the exercise of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) chivalry in aid of distressed damsels, Don Quixote, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand on the hilt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword, exclaimed in a loud and distinct voice: <div class="bookquote">``Let no one, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rank or condition, dare to follow the beautiful Marcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) has shown by clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault is to be found with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) for the death of Chrysostom, and also how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) is from yielding to the wishes of any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) lovers, for which reason, instead of being followed and persecuted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) should in justice be honoured and esteemed by all the good people of the world, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) shows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) is the only woman in it that holds to such a virtuous resolution.
<p/>Whether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote, or because Ambrosio told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none of the shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until, having finished the grave and burned Chrysostom's papers, they laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) body in it, not without many tears from those who stood by.
<p/>They closed the grave with a heavy stone until a slab was ready which Ambrosio said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) meant to have prepared, with an epitaph which was to be to this effect:
<p/>If Chrysostom's impatience and violent passion killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>), why should my modest behaviour and circumspection be blamed? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' Beneath the stone before your eyes
<p/>Ungrateful, cruel, coy, and fair, Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Chrysostom</b></font>) that drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) to despair, And Love hath made her (<font color='blue'><b>Chrysostom</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) ally For spreading wide his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) tyranny.
<p/>They then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches, and all expressing their condolence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) friend ambrosio, took their Vivaldo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ambrosio</b></font>) companion did the same; and Don Quixote bade farewell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to come with them to Seville, as being such a convenient place for finding adventures, for they presented themselves in every street and round every corner oftener than anywhere else.
<p/>Don Quixote thanked them for their advice and for the disposition they showed to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a favour, and said that for the present he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not, and must not go to Seville until he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had cleared all these mountains of highwaymen and robbers, of whom report said they were full.
<p/>Seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) good intention, the travellers were unwilling to press him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) further, and once more bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) farewell, they left him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and pursued their journey, in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the story of Marcela and Chrysostom as well as the madness of Don Quixote.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) part, resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and make offer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) of all the service he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could render her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>); but things did not fall out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) expected, according to what is related in the course of this veracious history, of which the Second Part ends here.
<p/>The body of a lover lies; In life he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was a shepherd swain, In death a victim to disdain. CHAPTER XV.
<p/>IN WHICH IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL IN WITH WHEN HE (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANS
<p/>The sage Cide Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote took leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hosts and all who had been present at the burial of Chrysostom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire passed into the same wood which they had seen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for more than two hours in all directions in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>) without finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marcela</b></font>), they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which ran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there the hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning to come on oppressively.
<p/>Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning Rocinante and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, they ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very peacefully and sociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them.
<p/>Sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling sure, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) staidness and freedom from incontinence, that all the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Cordova</b></font>) into an impropriety.
<p/>Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep, so ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of Galician ponies belonging to certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way it is to take their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where grass and water abound; and
<p/>It so happened, then, that Rocinante took a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, and abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) usual gait and demeanour as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) scented them, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), without asking leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) master, got up a briskish little trot and hastened to make known his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferred their pasture to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), and received him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) with their heels and teeth to such effect that they soon broke his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) girths and left him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) naked without a saddle to cover him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>); but what must have been worse to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was that the carriers, seeing the violence he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was offering to their mares, came running up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) that they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sorely battered to the ground.
<p/>By this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of Rocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho: ``So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base folk of low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the devil vengeance can we take,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``if they are more than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more than one and a half?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I count for a hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, and without more words he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by the example of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don Quixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather jerkin he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wore, together with a great portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>The Yanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were so many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the second blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote fared the same way, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) skill and high mettle availing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) nothing, and fate willed it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who had not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry boorish hands.
<p/>Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.
<p/>Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in a weak and doleful voice, <div class="bookquote">``Senor Don Quixote, ah, Senor Don Quixote!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>that where Don Quixote chanced to be suited the Yanguesans' purpose very well. '' '' What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?'' answered Don Quixote in the same feeble suffering tone as Sancho.
<p/>I would like, if it were possible,'' answered Sancho Panza, <div class="bookquote">``your worship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as well as for wounds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, I mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet?'' answered Sancho Panza.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us.
<p/>It is at when thou shalt see rabble of this sort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against them, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise them to thy heart's content, and if any knights come to their aid and defence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my might; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what the might of this strong arm of mine is equal
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,'' said the battered knight Don Quixote; to''--so uplifted had the poor gentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Senor, I am a man of peace, meek and quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and children to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your worship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw sword either against clown or against knight, and that here before God I forgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they have been, are, or shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble or commoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.
<p/>But Sancho did not so fully approve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's admonition as to let it pass without saying in reply, ''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>To all which his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master said in reply, <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had breath enough to speak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would abate so as to let me explain to thee
<p/>Come now, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse, should turn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so that safely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those islands
<p/>, Panza, the mistake thou makest. I have promised thee , how would it be with thee if on winning it I made thee lord of it?
<p/>Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not being a knight nor having any desire to be one, nor possessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making some move to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what chance may do for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have good sense to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to govern, and valour to attack and defend himself, whatever may befall him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>In what has now befallen us,'' answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I'd have been well pleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of, but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than for arguments.
<p/>See if your worship can get up, and let us help Rocinante, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not deserve it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the main cause of all this thrashing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be a virtuous person and as quiet as myself.
<p/>After all, they say right that it takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing sure in this life.
<p/>Who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling post and at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet thine, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``ought to be used to such squalls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain they must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not that I imagine
<p/>--why do I say imagine?--know of a certainty that all these annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, I would lay me down here to die of pure vexation.
<p/>To this the squire replied, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, as these mishaps are what one reaps of chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their own fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after two harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) infinite mercy helps us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the squire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Know, friend Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that the life of knights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and neither more nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant to become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in the case of many different knights with whose histories I am thoroughly acquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have mentioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) captive, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) horse while tied to one of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the Knight of Phoebus, being caught in a certain pitfall, which opened under his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) feet in a certain castle, on falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground, where they administered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) one of those things they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>); and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), it would have gone very hard with the poor knight;
<p/>so I may well suffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities which they had to suffer than those which we suffer.
<p/>that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words:
<p/>if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) struck with it has been cudgelled.
<p/>I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They gave me no time to see that much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for hardly had I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death does not remove.
<p/>And what greater misfortune can there be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Panza, <div class="bookquote">``than the one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it?
<p/>If our mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to put us right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to do,'' returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast.
<p/>There is nothing wonderful in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is a knight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free where we come out scotched.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``I say so because this little beast may now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I may be cured of my wounds.
<p/>And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) entered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be true that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) went mounted as your worship says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, ``but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung like a sack of manure.
<p/>To which Don Quixote replied, <div class="bookquote">``Wounds received in battle confer honour instead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us in these wilds.
<p/>And yet I have heard your worship say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>observed Panza, <div class="bookquote">``that it is very meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they esteem it very good fortune.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That is,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``when they cannot help it, or when they are in love; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) abode on the Pena Pobre for--
<p/>I know not if it was eight years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stayed there doing penance for
<p/>I know not what pique the Princess Oriana had against him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste before a mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>The very devil would be in it in that case,'' said Sancho; and letting off thirty <div class="bookquote">``ohs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations on whomsoever
<p/>it was that had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pains he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saddled his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) next raised up Rocinante, and as for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) possessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master would have been behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) proceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the high road might be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) perceived an inn, which to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixote must needs be a castle.
<p/>Sancho insisted that it was an inn, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master that it was not one, but a castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was settled they had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) team without any further controversy.
<p/>'' For I would have thee know, Sancho, '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' CHAPTER XVI. OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THE INN
<p/>WHICH HE (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) TOOK TO BE A CASTLE The innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho what was amiss with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had fallen down from a rock and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ribs a little bruised.
<p/>The innkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) calling commonly have, for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) neighbours, so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at once set about tending Don Quixote, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) young daughter, a very comely girl, help her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in taking care of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) guest.
<p/>There was besides in the inn, as servant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one eye and not very sound in the other.
<p/>The elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) shape, to be sure, made up for all her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) defects; she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) shoulders, which overweighted her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) somewhat, made her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) contemplate the ground more than she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) liked.
<p/>This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and, though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mules, had much the advantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without missing one in the reckoning.
<p/>On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) daughter soon covered him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with plasters from top to toe, while Maritornes--for that was the name of the Asturian--held the light for them, and while plastering him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), the hostess, observing how full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.
<p/>It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projections, and that each of them had left its mark.
<p/>Pray, senora,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins too
<p/>I did not fall,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sancho Panza, <div class="bookquote">``but from the shock I got at seeing my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.
<p/>That may well be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said the young girl, <div class="bookquote">``for it has many a time happened to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken as if I had really fallen.

'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you must have fallen too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div>said the hostess. '' '' '' '' '' There is the point, senora,'' replied Sancho Panza, <div class="bookquote">``that
<p/>I without dreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.
<p/>Don Quixote of La Mancha,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho Panza, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world this long time past.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How is the gentleman called?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Maritornes the Asturian. '' '' What is a knight-adventurer?'' said the lass. '' Are you so new in the world as not to know?'' answered Sancho Panza.
<p/>Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms to give his (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) squire.''
<p/>Then how is it,'' said the hostess, <div class="bookquote">``that belonging to so good a master as this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too soon yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, ``for we have only been a month going in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain.
<p/>To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sitting up in bed as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could, and taking the hostess by the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castle of yours
<p/>sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I am.
<p/>I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitude while life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between my teeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty.
<p/>The hostess, her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in bewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about as much of them as if he (<font color='blue'><b>masters</b></font>) had been talking Greek, though they could perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, they stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>masters</b></font>) and wondered to themselves, for he (<font color='blue'><b>masters</b></font>) seemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in pothouse phrase for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) civility they left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), while the Asturian gave her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master.
<p/>The carrier had made an arrangement with her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) for recreation that night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleep she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) would come in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wishes unreservedly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' And it is said of this good lass that she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them,
<p/>even though she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) made them in a forest and without any witness present, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) plumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an employment as servant in an inn, because, she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) said, misfortunes and ill-luck had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) to that position.
<p/>The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sancho made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas rather than of wool.
<p/>Next to these two beds was that of the carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings of the two best mules he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, and in prime condition, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to the author of this history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) very well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>); besides which Cide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in all things, as is very evident since he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) would not pass over in silence those that have been already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant
<p/>they might be, an example that might be followed by those grave historians who relate transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of the work being left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance.
<p/>A thousand blessings on the author of <div class="bookquote">``Tablante de Ricamonte''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>and that of the other book in which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minuteness they describe everything!
<p/>To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Conde</b></font>) team and given them their second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Conde</b></font>) pack-saddles and lay waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Conde</b></font>) conscientious Maritornes.
<p/>though he (<font color='blue'><b>Conde</b></font>) strove to sleep the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Conde</b></font>) ribs would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Conde</b></font>), while Don Quixote with the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes as wide open as a hare's.
<p/>The inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway.
<p/>This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the books that were the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) misfortune, conjured up to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) imagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fancied himself to have reached a famous castle -LRB-for, as has been said, all the inns he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lodged in were castles to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) eyes-RRB-, and that the daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), won by his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), and had promised to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) bed for a while that night without the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) parents; and holding all this fantasy that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had constructed as solid fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilous risk which his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) virtue was about to encounter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) resolved in his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) heart to commit no treason to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevere herself and the dame Quintanona should present themselves before him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>).
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour--an unlucky one for him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)--arrived for the Asturian to come, who in her (<font color='blue'><b>Guinevere</b></font>) smock, with bare feet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Guinevere</b></font>) hair gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three were quartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Guinevere</b></font>) gained the door when Don Quixote perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Guinevere</b></font>), and sitting up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bed in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) plasters and the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ribs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arms to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) beauteous damsel.
<p/>The Asturian, who went all doubled up and in silence with her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) hands before her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) lover, encountered the arms of Don Quixote, who grasped her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) tightly by the wrist, and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) dared not utter a word, made her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) sit down on the bed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) then felt her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) smock, and although it was of sackcloth it appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to be of the finest and softest silk: on her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) wrists she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) wore some glass beads, but to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) they had the sheen of precious Orient pearls: her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) hair, which in some measure resembled a horse's mane, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rated as threads of the brightest gold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself: her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) breath, which no doubt smelt of yesterday's stale salad, seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) mouth; and, in short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) portrait in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) imagination with the same features and in the same style as that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) books of the other princesses who, smitten by love, came with all the adornments that are here set down, to see the sorely wounded knight; and so great was the poor gentleman's blindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anything else about the good lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit, were enough to undeceive him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was persuaded he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had the goddess of beauty in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms, and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) firmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grasp he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went on to say in low, tender voice:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would that found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position to repay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of your great beauty, have granted me; but fortune, which is never weary of persecuting the good, has chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie so bruised and broken that though my inclination would gladly comply with yours it is impossible; besides, to this impossibility another yet greater is to be added, which is the faith that I have pledged to the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most secret thoughts; and were it not that this stood in the way I should not be so insensible a knight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodness has offered me.
<p/>Maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by Don Quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) strove without speaking to free herself.
<p/>The worthy carrier, whose unholy thoughts kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) awake, was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) doxy the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) entered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote said; and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) word with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for another, drew nearer to Don Quixote's bed and stood still to see what would come of this talk which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not understand; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote striving to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>), not relishing the joke he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm and delivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bathed all his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mouth in blood, and not content with this he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mounted on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) ribs and with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) feet tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot.
<p/>The bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet, unable to support the additional weight of the carrier, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl of Maritornes', because after calling loudly to her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) got no answer.
<p/>Sancho was by this time plastered and had lain down, and ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With this suspicion he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarter where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had heard the disturbance.
<p/>The wench, seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) master was coming and knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) temper was terrible, frightened and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and crouching upon it made a ball of herself.
<p/>At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass almost on top of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had the nightmare and began to distribute fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon Maritornes, who, irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many in return to Sancho that she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) woke him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) up in spite of himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) then, finding himself so handled, by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew not, raising himself up as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could, grappled with Maritornes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world.
<p/>The carrier, however, perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared with his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) ladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) the help she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) needed; and the innkeeper did the same but with a different intention, for his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) was to chastise the lass, as he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) believed that beyond a doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) alone was the cause of all the harmony.
<p/>And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to rope, rope to stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and the innkeeper her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>), and all worked away so briskly that they did not give themselves a moment's rest; and the best of it was that the innkeeper's lamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all laid on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a sound spot left where a hand could light.
<p/>It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a caudrillero of what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who, also hearing the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) staff and the tin case with his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) warrants, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) way in the dark into the room crying:
<p/>The innkeeper came in exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Where art thou, strumpet? Of course this is some of thy work. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The innkeeper</b></font>)</div>``Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction!
<p/>The first that he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who lay stretched senseless on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) broken-down bed, and, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand falling on the beard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) felt about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) continued to cry, <div class="bookquote">``Help for the Jurisdiction!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had laid hold of did not move or stir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was dead and that those in the room were his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) murderers, and with this suspicion he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) voice still higher, calling out, <div class="bookquote">``Shut the inn gate; see that no one goes out
<p/>Hold! in the name of the Holy Brotherhood! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; they have killed a man here!'' This cry startled them all, and each dropped the contest at the point at which the voice reached him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The innkeeper retreated to his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) room, the carrier to his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) pack-saddles, the lass to her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unable to move from where they were.
<p/>The cuadrillero on this let go Don Quixote's beard, and went out to look for a light to search for and apprehend the culprits; but not finding one, as the innkeeper had purposely extinguished the lantern on retreating to his (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) room, he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) was compelled to have recourse to the hearth, where after much time and trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) lit another lamp.
<p/>CHAPTER XVII. IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON QUIXOTE AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN,
<p/>By this time Don Quixote had recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) swoon; and in the same tone of voice in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had called to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire the day before when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lay stretched <div class="bookquote">``in the vale of the stakes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began calling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) now, <div class="bookquote">``Sancho, my friend, art thou asleep?
<p/>WHICH TO HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) MISFORTUNE HE (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) TOOK TO BE A CASTLE sleepest thou, friend Sancho?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can I sleep, curses on it!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho discontentedly and bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``when it is plain that all the devils have been at me this night?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Thou mayest well believe that,'' answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``because, either I know little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know-but this that I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until after my death.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I swear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho. '' I say so,'' continued Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``because I hate taking away anyone's good name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that I swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship's days, and God grant I may be able to let it out to-morrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but because I hate keeping things long, and I don't want them to grow rotten with me from over-keeping.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``I have more confidence in thy affection and good nature; and so I would have thee know that this night there befell me one of the strangest adventures that I could describe, and to relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little while ago the daughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is the most elegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in the wide world.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that thou wouldst see me dead so soon? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>What I could tell thee of the charms of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) person!
<p/>of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lively wit! of other secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe to my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in silence!
<p/>I will only tell thee that, either fate being envious of so great a boon placed in my hands by good fortune, or perhaps -LRB-and this is more probable-RRB- this castle being, as I have already said, enchanted, at the time when I was engaged in the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>), there came, without my seeing or knowing whence it came, a hand attached to some arm of some huge giant, that planted such a cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in blood, and then pummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight than yesterday when the carriers, on account of Rocinante's misbehaviour, inflicted on us the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there must be some enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel's beauty, and that it is not for me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for me either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for more than four hundred Moors have so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and fancy-bread to it.
<p/>But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now?
<p/>Though your worship was not so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable beauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks I think I had in all my life?
<p/>for I am not a knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the mishaps, the greater part falls to my share.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Unlucky me and the mother that bore me! '' Then thou hast been thrashed too?'' said Don Quixote. '' Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!'' said Sancho.
<p/>Be not distressed, friend,'' said Don Quixote, ``for I will now make the precious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an eye.
<p/>By this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and came in to see the man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought had been killed; and as Sancho caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) at the door, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) coming in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shirt, with a cloth on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head, and a lamp in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand, and a very forbidding countenance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, can it be that this is the enchanted Moor coming back to give us more castigation if there be anything still left in the ink-bottle?''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``It cannot be the Moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>If they don't let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,'' said Sancho; ``if not, let my shoulders speak to the point.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine could speak too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``but that is not a sufficient reason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor.
<p/>The officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peaceful conversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would speak more politely if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; ``is it the way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, you booby?
<p/>The cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a sorry-looking individual, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) temper, and raising the lamp full of oil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went out, and Sancho Panza said, <div class="bookquote">``That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Senor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) keeps the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and lamp-whacks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That is the truth,'' answered Don Quixote, ``and there is no use in troubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or vexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no one on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou canst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to give me a little oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam, for indeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing much blood from the wound that phantom gave me.
<p/>Sancho got up with pain enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bones, and went after the innkeeper in the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see what had become of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) enemy, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), ``Senor, whoever you are, do us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt, and wine, for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on earth, who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted Moor that is in this inn.
<p/>When the officer heard him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) talk in this way, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) for a man out of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) opened the inn gate, and calling the host, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) what this good man wanted.
<p/>The host furnished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) required, and Sancho brought it to Don Quixote, who, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head, was bewailing the pain of the blow of the lamp, which had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) no more harm than raising a couple of rather large lumps, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fancied blood was only the sweat that flowed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sufferings during the late storm.
<p/>To be brief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took the materials, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made a compound, mixing them all and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) they had come to perfection.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as there was not one in the inn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) decided on putting it into a tin oil-bottle or flask of which the host made him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a free gift; and over the flask he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) repeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more ave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross by way of benediction, at all which there were present Sancho, the innkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefully engaged in attending to the comfort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mules.
<p/>This being accomplished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt anxious to make trial himself, on the spot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) considered it, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and remained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) done drinking when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) began to vomit in such a way that nothing was left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) broke into a profuse sweat, on account of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bade them cover him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) up and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alone.
<p/>They did so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lay sleeping more than three hours, at the end of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) awoke and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bruises that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thought himself quite cured, and verily believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that with this remedy he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might thenceforward, without any fear, face any kind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.
<p/>Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master as miraculous, begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) what was left in the pigskin, which was no small quantity.
<p/>Don Quixote consented, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), taking it with both hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and drained off very little less than his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master.
<p/>But the fact is, that the stomach of poor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, and so, before vomiting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was seized with such gripings and retchings, and such sweats and faintness, that verily and truly he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) believed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) last hour had come, and finding himself so racked and tormented he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>Don Quixote seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in this state said, <div class="bookquote">``It is my belief, Sancho, that this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am persuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' The officer turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, how goes it, good man?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' ''
<p/>'' If your worship knew that,'' returned Sancho--<div class="bookquote">``woe betide me and all my kindred!--why did you let me taste it? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to discharge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had thrown himself and the canvas blanket he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) had covering him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) were fit for nothing afterwards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and convulsions that not only he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) himself but all present thought his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) end had come.
<p/>This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end of which he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was left, not like his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) master, but so weak and exhausted that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) could not stand.
<p/>Don Quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) departure at once in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) loitered there was a fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) help and protection, all the more when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had the security and confidence his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) balsam afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); and so, urged by this impulse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire's beast, whom likewise he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) helped to dress and mount the ass; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse and turning to a corner of the inn he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) laid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) by way of a lance.
<p/>All that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); the innkeeper's daughter was likewise observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) too never took his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes off her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and from time to time fetched a sigh that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seemed to pluck up from the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bowels; but they all thought it must be from the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ribs; at any rate they who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) plastered the night before thought so.
<p/>As soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) called to the host and said in a very grave and measured voice, ``Many and great are the favours, Senor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of yours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you of any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is no other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to chastise perfidy.
<p/>Search your memory, and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of knighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the utmost of your desire.
<p/>The innkeeper replied to him (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) with equal calmness, <div class="bookquote">``Sir Knight, I do not want your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done me I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is that you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night, as well for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and beds.
<p/>I have been under a mistake all this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for in truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it appears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is that you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of knights-errant, of whom I know as a fact -LRB-and up to the present I have read nothing to the contrary-RRB- that they never paid for lodging or anything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that might be offered them is their due by law and
<p/>right in return for the insufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day, in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst, cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the hardships of earth.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Then this is an inn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' And a very respectable one,'' said the innkeeper. '' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have little to do with that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the innkeeper</b></font>)</div>replied the innkeeper; ``pay me what you owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care about is to get my money.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, and putting spurs to Rocinante and bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pike to the slope he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rode out of the inn before anyone could stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and pushed on some distance without looking to see if his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire was following him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>The innkeeper when he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) go without paying him (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) ran to get payment of Sancho, who said that as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master would not pay neither would he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), because, being as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and reason held good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) as for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master with regard to not paying anything in inns and hostelries.
<p/>At this the innkeeper waxed very wroth, and threatened if he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) did not pay to compel him (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) in a way that he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) would not like.
<p/>To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master had received he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would not pay a rap, though it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) life; for the excellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was not going to be violated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), nor should the squires of such as were yet to come into the world ever complain of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) or reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with breaking so just a privilege.
<p/>The ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among the company in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, three needle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair of Seville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and playful, who, almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse, made up to Sancho and dismounted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, while one of them went in for the blanket of the host's bed; but on flinging him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) into it they looked up, and seeing that the ceiling was somewhat lower than what they required for their work, they decided upon going out into the yard, which was bounded by the sky, and there, putting Sancho in the middle of the blanket, they began to raise him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) high, making sport with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) as they would with a dog at Shrovetide.
<p/>The cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, who, halting to listen attentively, was persuaded that some new adventure was coming, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) clearly perceived that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) squire who uttered them.
<p/>Wheeling about he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came up to the inn with a laborious gallop, and finding it shut went round it to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could find some way of getting in; but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came to the wall of the yard, which was not very high, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) discovered the game that was being played with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) squire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) rage allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), it is my belief he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would have laughed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tried to climb from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) horse on to the top of the wall, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was so bruised and battered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not even dismount; and so from the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) horse he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) began to utter such maledictions and objurgations against those who were blanketing Sancho as it would be impossible to write down accurately: they, however, did not stay their laughter or their work for this, nor did the flying Sancho cease his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lamentations, mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all to little purpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off.
<p/>'' They then brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, and mounting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on top of it they put his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) jacket round him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); and
<p/>the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) so exhausted, thought fit to refresh him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with a jug of water, and that it might be all the cooler she (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fetched it from the well.
<p/>Sancho took it, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was raising it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was stopped by the cries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not, my son, for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam
<p/>-LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) held up the flask of liquor-RRB-, and with drinking two drops of it thou wilt certainly be restored. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words Sancho turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes asquint, and in a still louder voice said, <div class="bookquote">``Can it be your worship has forgotten that I am not a knight, or do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have left after last night?
<p/>Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and leave me to myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and at one and the same instant he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) left off talking and began drinking; but as at the first sup he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) perceived it was water he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did not care to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) some wine, which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did with right good will, and paid for it with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own money; for indeed they say of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was in that line of life, there was some faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>When Sancho had done drinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) dug his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heels into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, and the gate of the inn being thrown open he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) passed out very well pleased at having paid nothing and carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) point, though it had been at the expense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) usual sureties, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>It is true that the innkeeper detained his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alforjas in payment of what was owing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), but Sancho took his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) departure in such a flurry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) never missed them.
<p/>The innkeeper, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) off, wanted to bar the gate close, but the blanketers would not agree to it, for they were fellows who would not have cared two farthings for Don Quixote, even had he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) been really one of the knights-errant of the Round Table.
<p/>CHAPTER XVIII. IN WHICH IS RELATED THE DISCOURSE SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) MASTER, DON QUIXOTE, AND OTHER ADVENTURES WORTH RELATING Sancho reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master so limp and faint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not urge on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beast.
<p/>When Don Quixote saw the state he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was in he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, ``I have now come to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt enchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with thee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world?
<p/>and I hold this confirmed by having noticed that when I was by the wall of the yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy, it was out of my power to mount upon it, nor could I even dismount from Rocinante, because they no doubt had me enchanted; for I swear to thee by the faith of what I am that if I had been able to climb up or dismount, I would have avenged thee in such a way that those braggart thieves would have remembered their freak for ever, even though in so doing I knew that I contravened the laws of chivalry, which, as I have often told thee, do not permit a knight to lay hands on him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) who is not one, save in case of urgent and great necessity in defence of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own life and person.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have avenged myself too if I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``whether I had been dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I am persuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or enchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone like ourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them when they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and another Tenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan Palomeque the Left-handed; so that, senor, your not being able to leap over the wall of the yard or dismount from your horse
<p/>came of something else besides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this is, that these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into such misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; and that the best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be for us to return home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our business, and give over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail to bucket, as the saying is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; ``hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt see with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the pursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there be in the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle, and triumphing over one's enemy?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``though I do not know it; all I know is that since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been one -LRB-for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number-RRB- we have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan, and even out of that your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the less; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings and more cudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over and above, and falling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannot avenge myself so as to know what the delight, as your worship calls it, of conquering an enemy is like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,'' replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand some sword made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who carries it, and it is even possible that fortune may procure for me that which belonged to Amadis when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was called `The Knight of the Burning Sword,' which was one of the best swords that ever knight in the world possessed, for,
<p/>besides having the said virtue, it cut like a razor, and there was no armour, however strong and enchanted it might be, that could resist it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Such is my luck,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that even if that happened and your worship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn out serviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires, they might sup sorrow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>None, beyond all doubt. '' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Fear not that, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote: ``Heaven will deal better by thee.
<p/>Thus talking, Don Quixote and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire were going along, when, on the road they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them a large and thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) turned to Sancho and said: <div class="bookquote">``This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is reserving for me; this, I say, is the day on which as much as on any other shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall do deeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to come.
<p/>Well, then, all that is churned up by a vast army composed of various and countless nations that comes marching there.
<p/>According to that there must be two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``for on this opposite side also there rises just such another cloud of dust.
<p/>Don Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicing exceedingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) concluded that they were two armies about to engage and encounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and seasons his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures, crazy feats, loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books of chivalry, and everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, thought, or did had reference to such things.
<p/>Now the cloud of dust he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had seen was raised by two great droves of sheep coming along the same road in opposite directions, which, because of the dust, did not become visible until they drew near, but Don Quixote asserted so positively that they were armies that Sancho was led to believe it and say, ``Well, and what are we to do, senor?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote: <div class="bookquote">``give aid and assistance to the weak and those who need it; and thou must know, Sancho, that this which comes opposite to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron, lord of the great isle of Trapobana;
<p/>this other that marches behind me is that of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) enemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, for he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) always goes into battle with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) right arm bare.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>Seest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? '' '' '' '' '' '' But why are these two lords such enemies?''
<p/>They are at enmity,'' replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``because this Alifanfaron is a furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is a very beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father is unwilling to bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) upon the pagan king unless he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) first abandons the religion of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) false prophet Mahomet, and adopts his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``By my beard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but Pentapolin does quite right, and I will help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) as much as I can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``for to engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed knight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I can well understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``but where shall we put this ass where we may be sure to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) after the fray is over?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>for I believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of this kind.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``and what you had best do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chance whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) be lost or not,
<p/>for the horses we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even Rocinante will run a risk of being changed for another.
<p/>But attend to me and observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief knights who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and mark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both armies may be seen.
<p/>They did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two droves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the sight; nevertheless, seeing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) imagination what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not see and what did not exist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began thus in a loud voice:
<p/>``That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with flowers of gold, who bears on his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) shield three crowns argent on an azure field, is the dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that other of gigantic frame, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Silver</b></font>) right hand, is the ever dauntless Brandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour wears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate which, according to tradition, is one of those of the temple that Samson brought to the ground when by his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) death he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) revenged himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) enemies.
<p/>But turn thine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonel of Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms quartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto which says Miau, which is the beginning of the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) lady, who according to report is the peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the other, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikes the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears azure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for device on his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) shield an asparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that says, Rastrea mi suerte.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) went on naming a number of knights of one squadron or the other out of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) imagination, and to all he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and mottoes, carried away by the illusions of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) unheard-of craze; and without a pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) continued, ``People of divers nations compose this squadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the famous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those that sift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and various ways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians, faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, the Parthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever shift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the Ethiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whose features I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names.
<p/>In this other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streams of the olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenances with the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice in the fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesian plains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in the Elysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears of corn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that bathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feed their herds along the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed for its hidden course, those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad Pyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty Apennine; in a word, as many as all Europe includes and contains.
<p/>giving to each its proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and saturated with what he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had read in his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) lying books!
<p/>Sancho Panza hung upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) words without speaking, and from time to time turned to try if he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) could see the knights and giants his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master was describing, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) could not make out one of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Senor, devil take it if there's a sign of any man you talk of, knight or giant, in the whole thing
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Good God! what a number of countries and nations he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) named! ; maybe it's all enchantment, like the phantoms last night.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How canst thou say that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``dost thou not hear the neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll of the drums?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; which was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.
<p/>The fear thou art in, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``prevents thee from seeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to derange the senses and make things appear different from what they are; if thou art in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself, for alone I suffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall give my aid;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) gave Rocinante the spur, and putting the lance in rest, shot down the slope like a thunderbolt.
<p/>Sancho shouted after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), crying, <div class="bookquote">``Come back, Senor Don Quixote; I vow to God they are sheep and ewes you are charging!
<p/>Look, there is no giant, nor knight, nor cats, nor arms, nor shields quartered or whole, nor vair azure or bedevilled.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Come back! Unlucky the father that begot me! what madness is this! What are you about? Sinner that I am before God!''
<p/>But not for all these entreaties did Don Quixote turn back; on the contrary he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went on shouting out, ``Ho, knights, ye who follow and fight under the banners of the valiant emperor Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, follow me all; ye shall see how easily I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) revenge over his (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) enemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana.
<p/>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and began spearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) were transfixing mortal enemies in earnest.
<p/>The shepherds and drovers accompanying the flock shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) to desist; seeing it was no use, they ungirt their slings and began to salute his (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) ears with stones as big as one's fist.
<p/>Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting drive right and left kept saying: ``Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron?
<p/>Come before me; I am a single knight who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make thee yield thy life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant Pentapolin Garamanta.
<p/>Here came a sugar-plum from the brook that struck him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on the side and buried a couple of ribs in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) body.
<p/>Feeling himself so smitten, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) imagined himself slain or badly wounded for certain, and recollecting his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) liquor he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) flask, and putting it to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mouth began to pour the contents into his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) stomach; but ere he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had succeeded in swallowing what seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) enough, there came another almond which struck him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on the hand and on the flask so fairly that it smashed it to pieces, knocking three or four teeth and grinders out of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mouth in its course, and sorely crushing two fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Such was the force of the first blow and of the second, that the poor knight in spite of himself came down backwards off his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) horse.
<p/>The shepherds came up, and felt sure they had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); so in all haste they collected their flock together, took up the dead beasts, of which there were more than seven, and made off without waiting to ascertain anything further.
<p/>All this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was performing, and tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beard and cursing the hour and the occasion when fortune had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), then, brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had taken themselves off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in very bad case, though not unconscious; and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Did I not tell you to come back, Senor Don Quixote; and that what you were going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That's how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify things,'' answered Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``thou must know, Sancho, that it is a very easy matter for those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sort to make us believe what they choose; and this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of the glory he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew I was to win in this battle, has turned the squadrons of the enemy into droves of sheep.
<p/>At any rate, do this much, I beg of thee, Sancho, to undeceive thyself, and see that what I say is true; mount thy ass and follow them quietly, and thou shalt see that when they have gone some little distance from this they will return to their original shape and, ceasing to be sheep, become men in all respects as I described them to thee at first.
<p/>But go not just yet, for I want thy help and assistance; come hither, and see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing, for I feel as if there was not one left in my mouth.
<p/>Sancho came so close that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) almost put his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mouth; now just at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote, so, at the very instant when Sancho came to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) discharged all its contents with more force than a musket, and full into the beard of the compassionate squire.
<p/>Clearly this sinner is mortally wounded, as he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) vomits blood from the mouth;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>but considering the matter a little more closely he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) perceived by the colour, taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the flask which he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) drink; and he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) was taken with such a loathing that his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) stomach turned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) vomited up his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) inside over his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) very master, and both were left in a precious state.
<p/>Sancho ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass to get something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alforjas; but not finding them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) well-nigh took leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) senses, and cursed himself anew, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart resolved to quit his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master and return home, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) forfeited the wages of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) service and all hopes of the promised island.
<p/>Don Quixote now rose, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) left hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mouth to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) laid hold of the bridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master's side--so loyal and well-behaved was he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>)--and betook himself to where the squire stood leaning over his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) ass with his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) cheek, like one in deep dejection.
<p/>Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) does more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs that fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with us, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence it follows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh at hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which happen to me, since thou hast no share in them.''

<p/>'' Yes, they are missing,'' answered Sancho. '' In that case we have nothing to eat to-day,'' replied Don Quixote. ''
<p/>It would be so,'' answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``if there were none of the herbs your worship says you know in these meadows, those with which knights-errant as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like shortcomings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I would rather have just now a quarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards' heads, than all the herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna's notes.
<p/>Nevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me, for God, who provides for all things, will not fail us -LRB-more especially when we are so active in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) service as we are-RRB-, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fails not the midges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of the water, and is so merciful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) maketh his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sun to rise on the good and on the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote; ``for there were knights-errant in former times as well qualified to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an encampment, as if they had graduated in the University of Paris; whereby we may see that the lance has never blunted the pen, nor the pen the lance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, be it as your worship says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho; ``let us be off now and find some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may be somewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms, nor enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole concern.

<p/>Well, then,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``in this lower side your worship has no more than two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor any at all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.''

(<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not the sword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a mill without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a diamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to all this.
<p/>Sancho did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and proceeded in the direction in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might find refuge without quitting the high road, which was there very much frequented.
<p/>As they went along, then, at a slow pace--for the pain in Don Quixote's jaws kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) uneasy and ill-disposed for speed--Sancho thought it well to amuse and divert him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) by talk of some kind, and among the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was that which will be told in the following chapter.
<p/>Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee at whatever pace thou wilt. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XIX. OF THE SHREWD DISCOURSE
<p/>WHICH SANCHO HELD WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>SANCHO</b></font>) MASTER, AND OF THE ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL HIM WITH A DEAD BODY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER NOTABLE OCCURRENCES
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me, senor, that all these mishaps that have befallen us of late have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed by your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath you made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, and all the rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had taken that helmet of Malandrino's, or whatever the Moor is called, for I do not very well remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>HIM</b></font>)</div><p/>Thou art very right, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but to tell the truth, it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that the affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in not reminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there are ways of compounding for everything in the order of chivalry.
<p/>It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity; and whether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a remedy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>In that case,'' said Sancho, ``mind that your worship does not forget this as you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into their heads to amuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worship if they see you so obstinate.
<p/>While engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the road before they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what made it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the loss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder and commissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventure which without any invention had really the appearance of one.
<p/>It so happened that the night closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that they pushed on, Sancho feeling sure that as the road was the king's highway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a league or two.
<p/>Going along, then, in this way, the night dark, the squire hungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the road they were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly like stars in motion.
<p/>Sancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did Don Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ass by the halter, the other his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hack by the bridle, and they stood still, watching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and found that the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came the greater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a man dosed with mercury, and Don Quixote's hair stood on end; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), however, plucking up spirit a little, said: <div class="bookquote">``This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure, in which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and resolution.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' answered Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``if this adventure happens to be one of phantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs to bear it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be they phantoms ever so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I will not permit them to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with thee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of the yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to wield my sword as I please.

(<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Unlucky me! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a good heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, please God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side of the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving lights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty encamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the awe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of Sancho, who began to chatter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) teeth like one in the cold fit of an ague; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart sank and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) teeth chattered still more when they perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered over with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning down to the very feet of their mules--for they could perceive plainly they were not horses by the easy pace at which they went.
<p/>This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary place was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho's heart, and even into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's; and -LRB-save in Don Quixote's case-RRB-
<p/>And as the encamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive tone. did so, for all Sancho's resolution had now broken down.
<p/>It was just the opposite with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) vividly as one of the adventures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) books.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head that the litter was a bier on which was borne some sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) alone; and without any further reasoning he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lance in rest, fixed himself firmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saddle, and with gallant spirit and bearing took up his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) position in the middle of the road where the encamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw them near at hand he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) voice and said: <div class="bookquote">``Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye are, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier, for, to judge by appearances, either
<p/>ye have done some wrong or some wrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I should know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done, or else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are in haste,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>answered one of the encamisados, <div class="bookquote">``and the inn is far off, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and spurring his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mule he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) moved on.
<p/>Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule by the bridle he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, ``Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an account of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat, all of you.
<p/>The mule was shy, and was so frightened at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bridle being seized that rearing up she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) rider to the ground over her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) haunches.
<p/>An attendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse Don Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) badly wounded to the ground, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wheeled round upon the others the agility with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for it seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so lightly and proudly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bear himself.
<p/>The encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night.
<p/>The mourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir themselves, and so with entire safety to himself Don Quixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will, for they all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry away the dead body they had in the litter.
<p/>Sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lord, and said to himself, ``Clearly this master of mine is as bold and valiant as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is.
<p/>A burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had thrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) presented the point of the lance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face, calling on him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to yield himself prisoner, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); to which the prostrate man replied, <div class="bookquote">``I am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir, for one of my legs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christian gentleman, not to kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege, for I am a licentiate
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' and I hold first orders. '' '' Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?'' said Don Quixote.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then still worse awaits you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``if you do not satisfy me as to all I asked you at first.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall be soon satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>the licentiate</b></font>)</div>said the licentiate; <div class="bookquote">``you must know, then, that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only a bachelor, and my name is Alonzo Lopez
<p/>; I am a native of Alcobendas, I come from the city of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who fled with the torches, and we are going to the city of Segovia accompanying a dead body which is in that litter, and is that of a gentleman who died in Baeza, where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was interred; and now, as I said, we are taking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bones to their burial-place, which is in Segovia, where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was born.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the licentiate</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What, senor?'' said the other. '' My bad luck. '' '' '' And who killed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?'' asked Don Quixote. ''
<p/>In that case,'' said Don Quixote, ``the Lord has relieved me of the task of avenging his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) death had any other slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); but, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) having slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug one's shoulders; I should do the same
<p/>were he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to slay myself; and I would have your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don Quixote by name, and it is my business and calling to roam the world righting wrongs and redressing injuries.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bachelor</b></font>)</div>said the bachelor, ``for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with a broken leg that will never see itself straight again all the days of its life; and the injury you have redressed in my case has been to leave me injured in such a way that I shall remain injured for ever; and the height of misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures.

<p/>As my fate has so willed it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the bachelor, ``I entreat you, sir knight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help me to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between the stirrup and the saddle.

<p/>Sancho made a bag of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) coat, and, getting together as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could, and as the bag would hold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) loaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beast, and then hastened to obey his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's call, and helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to remove the bachelor from under the mule; then putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) back
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the torch, and Don Quixote bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) follow the track of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) companions, and beg pardon of them on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) part for the wrong which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not help doing them.
<p/>God, by means of a malignant fever that took him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered the bachelor. '' '' '' '' '' '' '' And said Sancho, ``If by chance these gentlemen should want to know who was the hero that served them
<p/>so, your worship may tell them that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) is the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.
<p/>I forgot to mention that before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) said to Don Quixote, ``Remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands on a holy thing, juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand that Latin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, ``but I know well I did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think I was committing an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which, like a Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere, but upon phantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, I remember how it fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he (<font color='blue'><b>Diaz</b></font>) broke the chair of the ambassador of that king before his (<font color='blue'><b>Diaz</b></font>) Holiness the Pope, who excommunicated him (<font color='blue'><b>Diaz</b></font>) for the same; and yet the good Roderick of Vivar bore himself that day like a very noble and valiant knight.
<p/>On hearing this the bachelor took his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) departure, as has been said, without making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the <div class="bookquote">``Knight of the Rueful Countenance''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>more then than at any other time.
<p/>I will tell you,'' answered Sancho; ``it was because I have been looking at you for some time by the light of the torch held by that unfortunate, and verily your worship has got of late the most ill-favoured countenance
<p/>I ever saw: it must be either owing to the fatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth and grinders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but because the sage whose duty it will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it proper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore did; one being `He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Burning Sword,' another `He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Unicorn,' this one `He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Damsels,' that `He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Phoenix,' another `The Knight of the Griffin,' and another `He (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) of the Death,' and by these names and designations they were known all the world round; and so I say that the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind just now to call me `The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,' as I intend to call myself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit me better, I mean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very rueful countenance painted on my shield.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no occasion, senor, for wasting time or money on making that countenance,'' said Sancho; ``for all that need be done is for your worship to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and without anything more, either image or shield, they will call you `Him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of the Rueful Countenance' and believe me I am telling you the truth, for I assure you, senor -LRB-and in good part be it said-RRB-, hunger and the loss of your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as I say, the rueful picture may be very well spared.
<p/>Don Quixote laughed at Sancho's pleasantry; nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) resolved to call himself by that name, and have his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shield or buckler painted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had devised.
<p/>Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter were bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Senor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself than any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten and routed, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten them, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in search of us and give us trouble enough.
<p/>The ass is in proper trim, the mountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do but make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave and the living to the loaf.
<p/>And driving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ass before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master to follow, who, feeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and after proceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves in a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce, they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying their appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead man's clerical gentlemen -LRB-who seldom put themselves on short allowance-RRB- had brought with them on their sumpter mule.
<p/>But another piece of ill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was that they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips; and as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where they were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in the following chapter.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>The bachelor then took his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) departure. '' '' '' '' '' '' '' CHAPTER XX. OF THE UNEXAMPLED AND UNHEARD-OF
<p/>ADVENTURE WHICH WAS ACHIEVED BY THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WITH LESS PERIL THAN ANY EVER ACHIEVED BY ANY FAMOUS KNIGHT IN THE WORLD
<p/>It cannot be, senor, but that this grass is a proof that there must be hard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be well to move a little farther on, that we may find some place where we may quench this terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt is more distressing than hunger.
<p/>The advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) leading Rocinante by the bridle and Sancho the ass by the halter, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had packed away upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling their way, for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything; but they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, as if falling from great rocks, struck their ears.
<p/>The sound cheered them greatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came they heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction the sound of the water gave them, especially for Sancho, who was by nature timid and faint-hearted.
<p/>They heard, I say, strokes falling with a measured beat, and a certain rattling of iron and chains that, together with the furious din of the water, would have struck terror into any heart
<p/>The night was, as has been said, dark, and they had happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees, whose leaves stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; so that, what with the solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of the water, and the rustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe and dread; more especially as they perceived that the strokes did not cease, nor the wind lull, nor morning approach; to all which might be added their ignorance as to where they were.
<p/>But Don Quixote, supported by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante, and bracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm, brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pike to the slope, and said, ``Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven's will have been born in this our iron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it is called; I am he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant deeds are reserved; I am, I say again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who is to revive the Knights of the Round Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who is to consign to oblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantes and Tirantes, the Phoebuses and Belianises, with the whole herd of famous knights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which I live such exploits, marvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure their brightest deeds.
<p/>Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, the gloom of this night, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of those trees, the awful sound of that water in quest of which we came, that seems as though it were precipitating and dashing itself down from the lofty mountains of the Moon, and that incessant hammering that wounds and pains our ears; which things all together and each of itself are enough to instil fear, dread, and dismay into the breast of Mars himself, much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of the kind.
<p/>Well, then, all this that I put before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my spirit, making my heart burst in my bosom through eagerness to engage in this adventure, arduous as it promises to be; therefore tighten Rocinante's girths a little, and God be with thee; wait for me here three days and no more, and if in that time I come not back, thou canst return to our village, and thence, to do me a favour and a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, where thou shalt say to my incomparable lady Dulcinea that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) captive knight hath died in attempting things that might make him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) worthy of being called hers.
<p/>When Sancho heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's words he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) began to weep in the most pathetic way, saying: ``Senor, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadful adventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turn about and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don't drink for three days to come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will there be anyone to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a time heard the curate of our village, whom your worship knows well, preach that he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) who seeks danger perishes in it; so it is not right to tempt God by trying so tremendous a feat from which there can be no escape save by a miracle, and Heaven has performed enough of them for your worship in delivering you from being blanketed as I was, and bringing you out victorious and safe and sound from among all those enemies that were with the dead man; and if all this does not move or soften that hard heart, let this thought and reflection move it, that you will have hardly quitted this spot when from pure fear I shall yield my soul up to anyone that will take it.
<p/>I left home and wife and children to come and serve your worship, trusting to do better and not worse; but as covetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder, for just as I had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island your worship has so often promised me,
<p/>I see that instead and in lieu of it you mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach: for God's sake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your worship will not entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off till morning, for by what the lore I learned when I was a shepherd tells me it cannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the Horn is overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How canst thou see, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``where it makes that line, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when the night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole heaven?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>That's true,'' said Sancho, ``but fear has sharp eyes, and sees things underground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason to show that it now wants but little of day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it want what it may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``it shall not be said of me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from doing what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee, Sancho, to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to undertake now this so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care to watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is to tighten Rocinante's girths well, and wait here, for I shall come back shortly, alive or dead.
<p/>Sancho perceiving it his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's final resolve, and how little his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), determined to have recourse to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own ingenuity and compel him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could, to wait till daylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) quietly and without being felt, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass' halter tied both Rocinante's legs, so that when Don Quixote strove to go he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was unable as the horse could only move by jumps.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' but Don Quixote's. '' '' '' '' '' Seeing the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) trick, Sancho Panza said: ``See there, senor!
<p/>Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so ordered it that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate, and spur and strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as they say, against the pricks.
<p/>Don Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heels into the horse, the less he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); and not having any suspicion of the tying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or until Rocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came of something other than Sancho's ingenuity.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``As it is so, Sancho, and as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait till dawn smiles upon us, even though I weep while it delays its coming.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no need to weep,'' answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for I will amuse your worship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you like to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after the fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes and the moment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you are looking forward to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?'' said Don Quixote. '' Am I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take their rest in the presence of danger?
<p/>Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do as thou wilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with my character.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be not angry, master mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I did not mean to say that;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and coming close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) laid one hand on the pommel of the saddle and the other on the cantle so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's left thigh in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) embrace, not daring to separate a finger's width from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); so much afraid was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of the strokes which still resounded with a regular beat.
<p/>Don Quixote bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) tell some story to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had proposed, to which Sancho replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would if his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) dread of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heard would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I will strive to tell a story which, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes with the telling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me your attention, for here I begin.
<p/>What was, was; and may the good that is to come be for all, and the evil for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who goes to look for it--your worship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their tales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of Cato Zonzorino the Roman, that says `the evil for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) that goes to look for it,' and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to show that your worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any quarter, and that we should go back by some other road, since nobody forces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>continued Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that in a village of Estremadura there was a goat-shepherd--that is to say, one who tended goats--which shepherd or goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this Lope Ruiz was in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdess called Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this rich grazier-

<p/>Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am telling this,'' answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and I cannot tell it in any other, nor is it right of your worship to ask me to make new customs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell it as thou wilt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``and as fate will have it that I cannot help listening to thee, go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>And so, lord of my soul,'' continued Sancho, as I have said, this shepherd was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild buxom lass with something of the look of a man about her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) had little moustaches; I fancy
<p/>I did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>),'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who told me the story said it was so true and certain that when I told it to another I might safely declare and swear I had seen it all myself.
<p/>And so in course of time, the devil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion, contrived that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into hatred and ill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was some little jealousy
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) caused him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) that crossed the line and trespassed on forbidden ground; and so much did the shepherd hate her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) from that time forward that, in order to escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) determined to quit the country and go where he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) should never set eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) again.
<p/>Torralva, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) found herself spurned by Lope, was immediately smitten with love for him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) had never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That is the natural way of women,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``to scorn the one that loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It came to pass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that the shepherd carried out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) intention, and driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) goats before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) way across the plains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal.
<p/>Torralva, who knew of it, went after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and on foot and barefoot followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) at a distance, with a pilgrim's staff in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand and a scrip round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) neck, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) carried, it is said, a bit of looking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of paint for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) face; but let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) carry what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did, I am not going to trouble myself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say, came with his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) flock to cross over the river Guadiana, which was at that time swollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) came to there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) flock to the other side, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was much vexed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) perceived that Torralva was approaching and would give him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) great annoyance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tears and entreaties; however, he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) went looking about so closely that he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) a boat so small that it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) and agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) to carry himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) three hundred goats across.
<p/>The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over; he (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) came back and carried another over; he (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) came back again, and again brought over another--let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of it.
<p/>To proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming; still he (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) returned for another goat, and another, and another.''

<p/>All that may be,'' replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but I know that as to my story, all that can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count of the passage of the goats begins.''

<p/>Just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now approaching, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had eaten something laxative at supper, or that it was only natural -LRB-as is most likely-RRB-, Sancho felt a desire to do what no one could do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but so great was the fear that had penetrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) dared not separate himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master by as much as the black of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) nail; to escape doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wanted was, however, also impossible; so what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did for peace's sake was to remove his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) right hand, which held the back of the saddle, and with it to untie gently and silently the running string which alone held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) breeches, so that on loosening it they at once fell down round his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) feet like fetters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) then raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shirt as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could and bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hind quarters, no slim ones.
<p/>But, this accomplished, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancied was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had to do to get out of this terrible strait and embarrassment, another still greater difficulty presented itself, for it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) impossible to relieve himself without making some noise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ground his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) teeth and squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shoulders together, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) breath as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could; but in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) precautions he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was unlucky enough after all to make a little noise, very different from that which was causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) so much fear.
<p/>'' Don Quixote, hearing it, said, <div class="bookquote">``What noise is that, Sancho?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); ``it must be something new, for adventures and misadventures never begin with a trifle.
<p/>Once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) luck, and succeeded so well, that without any further noise or disturbance he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found himself relieved of the burden that had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) so much discomfort.
<p/>But as Don Quixote's sense of smell was as acute as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that the fumes rose almost in a straight line, it could not be but that some should reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) nose, and as soon as they did he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came to its relief by compressing it between his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone, <div class="bookquote">``Sancho, it strikes me thou art in great fear.

<p/>Very likely,'' said Sancho, ``but that's not my fault, but your worship's, for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then go back three or four, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, all the time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fingers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) nose; <div class="bookquote">``and for the future pay more attention to thy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great familiarity with thee that has bred this contempt.''

<p/>With this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the night, till Sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very cautiously untied Rocinante and tied up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) breeches.
<p/>As soon as Rocinante found himself free, though by nature he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was not at all mettlesome, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seemed to feel lively and began pawing--for as to capering, begging his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pardon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew not what it meant.
<p/>Don Quixote, then, observing that Rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and a signal that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should attempt the dread adventure.
<p/>By this time day had fully broken and everything showed distinctly, and Don Quixote saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, but could not discover what caused it, and so without any further delay he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) let Rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) there three days at most, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had said before, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should not have returned by that time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might feel sure it had been God's will that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should end his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) days in that perilous adventure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) again repeated the message and commission with which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was to go on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) behalf to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lady Dulcinea, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was not to be uneasy as to the payment of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) services, for before leaving home he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would find himself fully recompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had served; but if God delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) safe, sound, and unhurt out of that danger, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might look upon the promised island as much more than certain.
<p/>Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affecting words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) good master, and resolved to stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) until the final issue and end of the business.
<p/>From these tears and this honourable resolve of Sancho Panza's the author of this history infers that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) must have been of good birth and at least an old Christian; and the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) displayed touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) but not so much as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) show any weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) felt as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of the water and of the strokes seemed to come.
<p/>Sancho followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on foot, leading by the halter, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) custom was, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing some distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little meadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of water flung itself.
<p/>At the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed houses looking more like ruins than houses, from among which came, they perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still continued without intermission.
<p/>Rocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of the blows, but quieting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Don Quixote advanced step by step towards the houses, commending himself with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady, imploring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) support in that dread pass and enterprise, and on the way commending himself to God, too, not to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Sancho who never quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) side, stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) neck as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could and peered between the legs of Rocinante to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could now discover what it was that caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) such fear and apprehension.
<p/>They went it might be a hundred paces farther, when on turning a corner the true cause, beyond the possibility of any mistake, of that dread-sounding and to them awe-inspiring noise that had kept them all the night in such fear and perplexity, appeared plain and obvious; and it was -LRB-if, reader, thou art not disgusted and disappointed-RRB- six fulling hammers which by their alternate strokes made all the din.
<p/>Sancho glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head bent down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced at Sancho and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cheeks puffed out and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mouth full of laughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) vexation he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not help laughing at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); and when Sancho saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master begin he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) let go so heartily that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sides with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter.
<p/>Four times he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stopped, and as many times did his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) laughter break out afresh with the same violence as at first
<p/>, whereat Don Quixote grew furious, above all when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) say mockingly, <div class="bookquote">``Thou must know, friend Sancho, that of Heaven's will
<p/>I was born in this our iron age to revive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) for whom are reserved perils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went on repeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard the awful strokes.
<p/>Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) into ridicule, was so mortified and vexed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pike and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) two such blows that if, instead of catching them on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shoulders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had caught them on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heirs.
<p/>Sancho seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was getting an awkward return in earnest for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) jest, and fearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master might carry it still further, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) very humbly, <div class="bookquote">``Calm yourself, sir, for by God I am only joking.
<p/>When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was struck dumb and rigid from head to foot. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, if you are joking I am not,'' replied Don Quixote.
<p/>Look here, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers, had been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the courage required for the attempt and achievement?
<p/>Am I, perchance, being, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when perhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have, low boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them?
<p/>But turn me these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, one by one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels, then make what mockery you like of me.''
<p/>But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made between us -LRB-and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may befall you as safe and sound as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has brought you out of this one-RRB-, was it not a thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great fear we were in?--at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see now that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay is.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not deny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that what happened to us may be worth laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is not everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``your worship knew how to hit the right point with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the shoulders, thanks be to God and my own smartness in dodging it.
<p/>But let that pass; all will come out in the scouring; for I have heard say `he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loves thee well that makes thee weep;' and moreover that it is the way with great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) a pair of breeches; though I do not know what they give after blows, unless it be that knights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdoms on the mainland.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be on the dice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that all thou sayest will come true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that our first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the future bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my company; for in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and they are innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) lord as thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault of thine and of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect for me; of mine, that I do not make myself more respected.
<p/>There was Gandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the Insula Firme, and we read of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) always addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) lord with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) head bowed down and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) body bent double, more turquesco.

<p/>From all I have said thou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference between master and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: so that from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe more respect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may be provoked with you it will be bad for the pitcher.
<p/>The favours and benefits that I have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not your wages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.

<p/>It now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the fulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account of the late joke that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not enter them on any account; so turning aside to right
<p/>THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE KNIGHT they came upon another road, different from that which they had taken the night before.
<p/>Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head something that shone like gold, and the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) turned to Sancho and said: ``I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially that one that says, `Where one door shuts, another opens.'
<p/>I say so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if I do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night.
<p/>I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou rememberest.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' and I say no more-I'll full the soul out of you. '' The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that Don Quixote saw, was this.
<p/>In that neighbourhood there were two villages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary's shop nor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber of the larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and on this errand the barber was going, carrying with him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) a brass basin; but as luck would have it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) was on the way it began to rain, and not to spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) hat, which probably was a new one, he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) put the basin on his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) head, and being clean it glittered at half a league's distance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem to Don Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made to fall in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) crazy chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw the poor knight draw near, without entering into any parley with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), at Rocinante's top speed he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bore down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) through and through, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), without checking the fury of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) charge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cried to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>): ``Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that which is so reasonably my due.
<p/>The barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this apparition coming down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>), had no other way of saving himself from the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) ass; and no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) touched the ground than he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) sprang up more nimbly than a deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented himself, saying that the pagan had shown his (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) discretion and imitated the beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it is pursued.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) taking it in his (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) hands said: <div class="bookquote">``By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is worth a maravedis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and handed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) master, who immediately put it on his (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of fitment, and not finding it he (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous head-piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the worst of it is half of it is wanting.
<p/>When Sancho heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) call the basin a headpiece he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was unable to restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) laughter, but remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's wrath he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) checked himself in the midst of it.
<p/>I am laughing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to think of the great head the pagan must have had who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular barber's basin.
<p/>Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``that this wonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident have come into the hands of some one who was unable to recognise or realise its value, and who, not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did, and seeing it to be of the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of what it might be worth, and of the other made this which is like a barber's basin as thou sayest; but
<p/>be it as it may, to me who recognise it, its transformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights at the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style that that helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles shall not surpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will wear it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the more as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone.
<p/>That is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``if it is not shot with a sling as they were in the battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your worship's grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that made me vomit my bowels up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not grieve me much to have lost it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for thou knowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>So have I,'' answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but if ever I make it, or try it again as long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no intention of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with all my five senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as to being blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to prevent mishaps of that sort, and if they come there is nothing for it but to squeeze our shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes, and let ourselves go where luck and the blanket may send us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote on hearing this, <div class="bookquote">``for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but know that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance to trifles.
<p/>What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken rib, what cracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest?
<p/>For jest and sport it was, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that light I would have returned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks did for the rape of Helen, who, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) were alive now, or if my Dulcinea had lived then, might depend upon it she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would not be so famous for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) beauty as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) is;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Let it pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest, but I know what sort of jest and earnest it was, and I know it will never be rubbed out of my memory any more than off my shoulders.
<p/>But putting that aside, will your worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass, which that Martino that your worship overthrew has left deserted here?
<p/>for, from the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Martino</b></font>) took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martino</b></font>) heels and bolted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martino</b></font>) is not likely ever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never been in the habit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``of taking spoil of those whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away their horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the victor have lost his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to take that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war
<p/>; therefore, Sancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be; for when its owner sees us gone hence he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) will come back for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows I should like to take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``or at least to change it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily the laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let one ass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at least change trappings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On that head I am not quite certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and the matter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayest change them,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' What art thou laughing at, Sancho?'' said Don Quixote. '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' if so be thou hast urgent need of them.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So urgent is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that if they were for my own person I could not want them more;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and forthwith, fortified by this licence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) effected the mutatio capparum, rigging out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beast to the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it.
<p/>This done, they broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills, without casting a look in that direction, in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm they had caused them; and, all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and, without taking any fixed road -LRB-not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true knights-errant-RRB-
<p/>, they set out, guided by Rocinante's will, which carried along with it that of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) master, not to say that of the ass, which always followed him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) led, lovingly and sociably; nevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a venture without any other aim.
<p/>As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you?
<p/>For since you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to rot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of my tongue that I don't want to be spoiled.''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, on, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and be brief in thy discourse, for there is no pleasure in one that is long.
<p/>Well then, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I say that for some days past I have been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved, there is no one to see or know of them, and so they must be left untold for ever, to the loss of your worship's object and the credit they deserve; therefore it seems to me it would be better -LRB-saving your worship's better judgment-RRB- if we were to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand, in whose service your worship may prove the worth of your person, your great might, and greater understanding, on perceiving which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward us, each according to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) merits; and there you will not be at a loss for some one to set down your achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory for ever.
<p/>Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely limits, though I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry to write the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out.
<p/>Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but before that point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on probation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name and fame may be acquired, such that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) betakes himself to the court of some great monarch the knight may be already known by his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) deeds, and that the boys, the instant they see him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) enter the gate of the city, may all follow him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and surround him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), crying, `This is the Knight of the Sun'-or the Serpent, or any other title under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) may have achieved great deeds. '
<p/>This,' they will say, `is he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) who vanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the long enchantment under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) had been for almost nine hundred years.'
<p/>So from one to another they will go proclaiming his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) achievements; and presently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king of that kingdom will appear at the windows of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) royal palace, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) beholds the knight, recognising him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) arms and the device on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) shield, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) will as a matter of course say, `What ho!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Forth all ye, the knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh hither!'
<p/>At which command all will issue forth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>ho</b></font>) himself, advancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>ho</b></font>) closely, and salute him (<font color='blue'><b>ho</b></font>), kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>ho</b></font>) on the cheek, and will then lead him (<font color='blue'><b>ho</b></font>) to the queen's chamber, where the knight will find her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) with the princess her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) daughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished damsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the known world.
<p/>Straightway it will come to pass that she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) will fix her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) eyes upon the knight and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) upon her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), and each will seem to the other something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or why they will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and sorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their pains and sufferings known by speech.
<p/>Thence they will lead him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), no doubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, where, having removed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) armour, they will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) looked noble in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) armour he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will look still more so in a doublet.
<p/>When night comes he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will sup with the king, queen, and princess; and all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will never take his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) eyes off her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) will do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a damsel of great discretion.
<p/>The tables being removed, suddenly through the door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf followed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certain adventure, the work of an ancient sage; and he (<font color='blue'><b>dwarf</b></font>) who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight in the world.
<p/>The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none will bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the great enhancement of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) thoughts so high.
<p/>And the best of it is that this king, or prince, or whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful as himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) court, requests leave from him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to go and serve him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in the said war.
<p/>The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hands for the favour done to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); and that night he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will take leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) has already many times conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), the go-between and confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will sigh, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much distressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) lady he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come to herself and will present her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) white hands through the grating to the knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing them with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) tears.
<p/>It will be arranged between them how they are to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to make his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) absence as short as possible, which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will promise to do with many oaths; once more he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) hands, and takes his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) leave in such grief that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is well-nigh ready to die.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) betakes him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) thence to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) chamber, flings himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bed, cannot sleep for sorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of the king, queen, and princess, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) leave of the pair, it is told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive a visit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) departure, his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) heart is pierced, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is hardly able to keep from showing his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) pain.
<p/>The confidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) mistress, who listens with tears and says that one of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) greatest distresses is not knowing who this knight is, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is of kingly lineage or not; the damsel assures her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) that so much courtesy, gentleness, and gallantry of bearing as her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) knight possesses could not exist in any save one who was royal and illustrious; her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) anxiety is thus relieved, and she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) strives to be of good cheer lest she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) should excite suspicion in her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) parents, and at the end of two days she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) appears in public.
<p/>Meanwhile the knight has taken his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) departure; he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fights in the war, conquers the king's enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns to the court, sees his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady where he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was wont to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and it is agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shall demand her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in marriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) parents as the reward of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) services; the king is unwilling to give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) knows not who he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it may be, the princess comes to be his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bride, and her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) father comes to regard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is proved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom
<p/>'' , I know not what, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies, the princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king.
<p/>And here comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) squire and all who have aided him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in rising to so exalted a rank.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) marries his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) squire to a damsel of the princess's, who will be, no doubt, the one who was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great duke.''
<p/>That's what I'm waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your worship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.''
<p/>Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,'' replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for in the same manner, and by the same steps as I have described here, knights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we want now is to find out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and has a beautiful daughter; but there will be time enough to think of that, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the court.
<p/>that is wanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe
<p/>, I know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or even second cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to give me his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) daughter in marriage unless he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is first thoroughly satisfied on this point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned.
<p/>True it is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, and entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulct; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king
<p/>; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages in the world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings and princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords; so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are, and the others are what they formerly were not.
<p/>And I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with which the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied; and should he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) not be,
<p/>the princess will so love me that even though she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) will take me for her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) lord and husband in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) father; if not, then it comes to seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) and carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) off where I please; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) parents.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>It comes to this, too,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``what some naughty people say, `Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;' though it would fit better to say, 'A clear escape is better than good men's prayers.'
<p/>I say so because if my lord the king, your worship's father-in-law, will not condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing for it
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>That's what I want, and no mistake about it!'' said Sancho. '' '' There is another thing, too, '' but, as your worship says, to seize her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) and transport her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>).
<p/>But the mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful enjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his (<font color='blue'><b>confidante</b></font>) wife comes with the princess, and that with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>confidante</b></font>) tides over his (<font color='blue'><b>confidante</b></font>) bad luck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for his (<font color='blue'><b>confidante</b></font>) master, I suppose, may as well give her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>confidante</b></font>) at once for a lawful wife.''
<p/>Then since that may be,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing for it but to commend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``and mean be he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who thinks himself mean.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In God's name let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho: <div class="bookquote">``I am an old Christian, and to fit me for a count that's enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And more than enough for thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``and even wert thou not, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily give thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for when I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they may say what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee `your lordship,' whether they like it or not.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody can object to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote.

<p/>I say I will know how to behave, for once in my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat so well on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same brotherhood.
<p/>What will it be, then, when I put a duke's robe on my back, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count?
<p/>'' Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) master. '' So be it,'' answered Sancho. '' I believe they'll come a hundred leagues to see me.
<p/>Thou wilt look well,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but thou must shave thy beard often, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou dost not shave it every second day at least

(<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>asked Don Quixote.
<p/>and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they said was a very great man, and a man following him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on horseback in every turn he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took, just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tail.
<p/>I asked why this man did not join the other man, instead of always going behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); they answered me that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have never forgotten it.''
<p/>Thou art right,'' said Don Quixote, ``and in the same way thou mayest carry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all together, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the first count to have a barber to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>); and, indeed, shaving one's beard is a greater trust than saddling one's horse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let the barber business be my look-out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and your worship's be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>I will tell you,'' answered Sancho. '' Years ago I was for a month at the capital '' '' ''
<p/>So it shall be,'' answered Don Quixote, and raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw what will be told in the following chapter.
<p/>'' CHAPTER XXII. OF THE FREEDOM DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHO AGAINST THEIR WILL WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH
<p/>TO GO Cide Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this most grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history that after the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one, Don Quixote raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes and saw coming along the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck, like beads, on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their hands.
<p/>With them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as soon as Sancho saw them he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force of the king's orders.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but that these are people condemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king's galleys.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``however it may be, these people are going where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How by force?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>asked Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``is it possible that the king uses force against anyone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho.
<p/>Then if so,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``here is a case for the exercise of my office, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Recollect, your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Justice, which is the king himself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishing them for their crimes.
<p/>The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good enough to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the reason or reasons for which they were conducting these people in this manner.
<p/>One of the guards on horseback answered that they were galley slaves belonging to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) majesty, that they were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had any business to know.
<p/>Nevertheless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know from each of them separately the reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) misfortune;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>to this he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) added more to the same effect to induce them to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wanted
<p/>so civilly that the other mounted guard said to him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of every one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read them; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they will, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities.
<p/>With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they not granted it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) approached the chain and asked the first for what offences he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was now in such a sorry case.
<p/>For that only?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``why, if for being lovers they send people to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.
<p/>The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the galley slave; <div class="bookquote">``mine was that I loved a washerwoman's basket of clean linen so well, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law had not forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will to this moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion for torture
<p/>, the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back, and three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave end</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) made answer that it was for being a lover. '' '' '' '' '' What are gurapas?'' asked Don Quixote.
<p/>Gurapas are galleys,'' answered the galley slave, who was a young man of about four-and-twenty, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a native of Piedrahita.
<p/>Don Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply, so downcast and melancholy was he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); but the first answered for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for being musicians and singers are people sent to the galleys too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, sir,'' answered the galley slave, <div class="bookquote">``for there is nothing worse than singing under suffering.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I have heard say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who sings scares away his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) woes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here it is the reverse,''  (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div>said the galley slave; <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) who sings once weeps all his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; but one of the guards said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Sir, to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the torture
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is a cattle-stealer, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) confession they sentenced him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) to six years in the galleys, besides two hundred lashes that he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) has already had on the back; and he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves that were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub, and jeer, and despise him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) for confessing and not having spirit enough to say nay; for, say they, `nay' has no more letters in it than `yea,' and a culprit is well off when life or death with him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) depends on his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) own tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking they are not very far out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And I think so too,'' answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the third he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had asked the others, and the man answered very readily and unconcernedly, <div class="bookquote">``I am going for five years to their ladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats.
<p/>That,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the galley slave, <div class="bookquote">``is like a man having money at sea when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants; I say so because if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your worship now offers me, I would have greased the notary's pen and freshened up the attorney's wit with them, so that to-day I should be in the middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this road coupled like a greyhound.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' But God is great; patience--there, that's enough of it.
<p/>Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a white beard falling below his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) breast, who on hearing himself asked the reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) being there began to weep without answering a word, but the fifth acted as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) tongue and said, <div class="bookquote">``This worthy man is going to the galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on horseback.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div>replied the galley slave, <div class="bookquote">``and the offence for which they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay body-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him (<font color='blue'><b>sorcerer</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' That means,'' said Sancho Panza, <div class="bookquote">``as I take it, to have been exposed to shame in public. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>If that touch had not been thrown in,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not deserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command and be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one, being the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a well-ordered state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth; nay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other offices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this way many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this office and calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as women more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing and experience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths, and know not which is their right hand.
<p/>I should like to go farther, and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is not the fit place for it; some day I will expound the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that the additional fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a position on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) being a pimp; though I know well there are no sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some simple folk fancy, for our will
<p/>All that certain silly women and quacks do is to turn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have power to cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel the will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the good old man, <div class="bookquote">``and indeed, sir, as far as the charge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I cannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my only object
<p/>was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions were unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back from, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives me a moment's ease;''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and again he (<font color='blue'><b>pimp</b></font>) fell to weeping as before, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) took out a real of four from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bosom and gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in alms.
<p/>Don Quixote went on and asked another what his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) crime was, and the man answered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last one.
<p/>I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of mine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in short, I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a complicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear: it was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money
<p/>, I was near having my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six years, I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a young man; let life only last, and with that all will come right.
<p/>If you, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it to you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to pray for the life and health of your worship, that they may be as long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves.
<p/>This one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.
<p/>Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow, except that when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looked, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes turned in a little one towards the other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was bound differently from the rest, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) leg a chain so long that it was wound all round his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) body, and two rings on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a <div class="bookquote">``keep-friend''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``friend's foot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from which hung two irons reaching to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands were secured by a big padlock, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could neither raise his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mouth nor lower his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands.
<p/>is free, nor is there herb or charm that can force it. '' '' Don Quixote asked why this man carried so many more chains than the others.
<p/>The guard replied that it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put together, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they marched him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) in that fashion they did not feel sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>), but were in dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) making his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) escape.
<p/>What crimes can he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) have committed,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``if they have not deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) goes for ten years,'' replied the guard, <div class="bookquote">``which is the same thing as civil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the famous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the guard thing</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, senor commissary,''  (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div>said the galley slave at this, <div class="bookquote">``let us have no fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my family name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) own business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) will be doing enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the commissary, <div class="bookquote">``if you don't want me to make you hold your tongue in spite of your teeth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is easy to see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div>returned the galley slave, <div class="bookquote">``that man goes as God pleases, but some one shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo de Parapilla or not.
<p/>They do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the galley slave</b></font>)</div>returned Gines, <div class="bookquote">``but I will make them give over calling me so, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth.
<p/>If you, sir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed you, for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I am Gines de Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) says true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gines/Gines de Pasamonte/Pasamonte</b></font>)</div>said the commissary, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) has himself written his (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) story as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in pawn for two hundred reals.

<p/>So good is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gines/Gines de Pasamonte/Pasamonte</b></font>)</div>replied Gines, <div class="bookquote">``that a fig for `Lazarillo de Tormes,' and all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written compared with it:
<p/>all I will say about it is that it deals with facts, and facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gines/Gines de Pasamonte/Pasamonte</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Is it so good?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' '' And how is the book entitled?'' asked Don Quixote. '' The `Life of Gines de Pasamonte,''' replied the subject of it.
<p/>'' And is it finished?'' asked Don Quixote. '' How can it be finished,'' said the other, <div class="bookquote">``when my life is not yet finished?
<p/>All that is written is from my birth down to the point when they sent me to the galleys this last time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div><p/>In the service of God and the king I have been there for four years before now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are like,'' replied Gines; ``and it is no great grievance to me to go back to them, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many things left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than enough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for I have it by heart.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you have been there before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``You seem a clever fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' And an unfortunate one,'' replied Gines, <div class="bookquote">``for misfortune always persecutes good wit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gines/Gines de Pasamonte/Pasamonte</b></font>)</div><p/>I told you already to go gently, master commissary,'' said Pasamonte; ``their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) majesty orders you; if not, by the life of-never mind-; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we have had quite enough of this entertainment.
<p/>The commissary lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) not to ill-use him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), as it was not too much to allow one who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hands tied to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said: ``From all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one's want of courage under torture, that one's want of money, the other's want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your side.
<p/>All which presents itself now to my mind, urging, persuading, and even compelling me to demonstrate in your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world and caused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which I belong, and the vow
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It persecutes rogues,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the commissary. '' '' I took therein to give aid to those in need and under the oppression of the strong.
<p/>But as I know that it is a mark of prudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will ask these gentlemen, the guards and commissary, to be so good as to release you and let you go in peace, as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under more favourable circumstances; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves of those whom God and nature have made free.
<p/>Moreover, sirs of the guard,'' added Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``these poor fellows have done nothing to you; let each answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own sins yonder; there is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked or reward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to others, they being therein no way concerned.
<p/>This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if you comply with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you will not voluntarily, this lance and sword together with the might of my arm shall compel you to comply with it by force.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wants us to let the king's prisoners go, as if we had any authority to release them, or he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to order us to do so!
<p/>Go your way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that you've got on your head, and don't go looking for three feet on a cat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'''Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,'' replied Don Quixote, and acting on the word he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) so suddenly that without giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) time to defend himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to the ground sorely wounded with a lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that it was the one that had the musket.
<p/>The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this unexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback seized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don Quixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it would have gone badly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) if the galley slaves, seeing the chance before them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving to break the chain on which they were strung.
<p/>Such was the confusion, that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at all that was of any use.
<p/>Sancho, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) part, gave a helping hand to release Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary, took from him (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and levelling at another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>), without ever discharging it, drove every one of the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape Pasamonte's musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them.
<p/>Sancho was greatly grieved at the affair, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) anticipated that those who had fled would report the matter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said so to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, and entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to leave the place at once, and go into hiding in the sierra that was close by.
<p/>That is all very well,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but I know what must be done now;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now running riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) collected them round him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had to say, and addressed them as follows: ``To be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons of good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God is ingratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest proof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire, and it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I have taken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El Toboso, and there present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and say to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knight, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of the Rueful Countenance, sends to commend himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and that ye recount to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in full detail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up to the recovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go where ye will, and good fortune attend you.
<p/>Gines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, <div class="bookquote">``That which you, sir, our deliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the most impossible to comply with, because we cannot go together along the roads, but only singly and separate, and each one his (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) own way, endeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the Holy Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us.
<p/>What your worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship's intention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by night as by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt
<p/>, I mean to take up our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree.''

<p/>Pasamonte, who was anything but meek -LRB-being by this time thoroughly convinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had committed such a vagary as to set them free-RRB-, finding himself abused in this fashion, gave the wink to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) companions, and falling back
<p/>they began to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was quite unable to protect himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler, and poor Rocinante no more heeded the spur than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had been made of brass.
<p/>Don Quixote was unable to shield himself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) full on the body with such force that they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to the ground; and the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fell the student pounced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), snatched the basin from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head, and with it struck three or four blows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost to pieces.
<p/>They then stripped him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of a jacket that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wore over his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour, and they would have stripped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stockings if his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) greaves had not prevented them.
<p/>From Sancho they took his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) coat, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own way, more solicitous about keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than about burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and Don Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping head, serious, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ears from time to time as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; Rocinante stretched beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) too had been brought to the ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had done so much.
<p/>Sancho planted himself behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sheltered himself from the hailstorm that poured on both of them. CHAPTER XXIII.
<p/>HISTORY Seeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire, <div class="bookquote">``I have always heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throw water into the sea.

<p/>Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,'' returned Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``but, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be avoided; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the Holy Brotherhood, and they don't care two maravedis for all the knights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy
<p/>Thou art a coward by nature, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but lest thou shouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise, this once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that fury thou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in life or in death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrew from this danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy entreaties; for if thou sayest
<p/>otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and from this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie, and say thou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; and answer me not again; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing or retiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to carry some little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand here and await alone, not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread, but the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Seven Maccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoods in the world.''

<p/>I hear their arrows whistling past my ears this minute.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' -wit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just now.
<p/>Don Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was close by, as it was Sancho's design to cross it entirely and come out again at El Viso or Almodovar del Campo, and hide for some days among its crags so as to escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come to look for them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock of provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the galley slaves, a circumstance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) regarded as a miracle, seeing how they pillaged and ransacked.
<p/>That night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena, where it seemed prudent to Sancho to pass the night and even some days, at least as many as the stores he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) carried might last, and so they encamped between two rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which, according to the opinion of those who have not the light of the true faith, directs, arranges, and settles everything in its own way, so ordered it that Gines de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who by the virtue and madness of Don Quixote had been released from the chain, driven by fear of the Holy Brotherhood, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had good reason to dread, resolved to take hiding in the mountains; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fate and fear led him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to the same spot to which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had been led by theirs, just in time to recognise them and leave them to fall asleep: and as the wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to evildoing, and immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the future, Gines, who was neither grateful nor well-principled, made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) mind to steal Sancho Panza's ass, not troubling himself about Rocinante, as being a prize that was no good either to pledge or sell.
<p/>Aurora made her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness to Sancho Panza, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) Dapple was missing, and seeing himself bereft of him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) began the saddest and most doleful lament in the world, so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exclamations and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saying, <div class="bookquote">``O son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children's plaything, my wife's joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of my burdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>While Sancho slept he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stole his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, and before day dawned he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was far out of reach. the six-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily
<p/>Don Quixote, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled Sancho with the best arguments he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could, entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to be patient, and promising to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a letter of exchange ordering three out of five ass-colts that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had at home to be given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>Sancho took comfort at this, dried his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tears, suppressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sobs, and returned thanks for the kindness shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) by Don Quixote.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) part was rejoiced to the heart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to be just the place for the adventures he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was in quest of.
<p/>They brought back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) memory the marvellous adventures that had befallen knights-errant in like solitudes and wilds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went along reflecting on these things, so absorbed and carried away by them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had no thought for anything else.
<p/>Nor had Sancho any other care -LRB-now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was travelling in a safe quarter-RRB- than to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) appetite with such remains as were left of the clerical spoils, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) marched behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master laden with what Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) paunch, and so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could go that way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would not have given a farthing to meet with another adventure.
<p/>While so engaged he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes and saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master had halted, and was trying with the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pike to lift some bulky object that lay upon the ground, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hastened to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) if it were needful, and reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) just as with the point of the pike he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was raising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it, half or rather wholly rotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho had to help to take them up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to see what the valise contained.
<p/>Sancho did so with great alacrity, and though the valise was secured by a chain and padlock, from its torn and rotten condition he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was able to see its contents, which were four shirts of fine holland, and other articles of linen no less curious than clean; and in a handkerchief he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found a good lot of gold crowns, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw them he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for something!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Searching further he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found a little memorandum book richly bound; this Don Quixote asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to take the money and keep it for himself.
<p/>Sancho kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hands for the favour, and cleared the valise of its linen, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stowed away in the provision sack.
<p/>Considering the whole matter, Don Quixote observed: <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me, Sancho--and it is impossible it can be otherwise-that some strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked and slain by footpads, who brought him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) to this remote spot to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>I met half my charges. '' '' That cannot be,'' answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``because if they had been robbers they would not have left this money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Thou art right,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and I cannot guess or explain what this may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there is anything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what we want to know.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) opened it, and the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found in it, written roughly but in a very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sancho might hear it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found that it ran as follows:
<p/>SONNET Or Love is lacking in intelligence, Or to the height of cruelty attains, Or else it is my doom to suffer pains Beyond the measure due to my offence.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' But if Love be a God, it follows thence That he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows all, and certain it remains No God loves cruelty; then who ordains This penance that enthrals while it torments?
<p/>It were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name; Such evil with such goodness cannot live; And against Heaven I dare not charge the blame, I only know it is my fate to die.
<p/>There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``unless by that clue there's in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole matter.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who knows not whence his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) malady A miracle alone a cure can give.

(<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote.
<p/>I only said Chloe,'' replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``and that no doubt, is the name of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and, faith, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) must be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read more, your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and you will find something that will enlighten us.

'' Then let your worship read it aloud,'' said Sancho, ``for I am very fond of love matters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sancho had requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found it ran thus:
<p/>Thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence the news of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint.
<p/>'' Ungrateful one, thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy, but not more worthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth
<p/>What thy beauty raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to be an angel, by them
<p/>I should neither envy the fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own. I know thou art a woman.
<p/>Peace be with thee who hast sent war to me, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from thee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I reap not a revenge I would not have.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, <div class="bookquote">``There is less to be gathered from this than from the verses, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who wrote it is some rejected lover;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and turning over nearly all the pages of the book he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) found more verses and letters, some of which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could read, while others he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments, misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some rapturous, some doleful.
<p/>While Don Quixote examined the book, Sancho examined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the pad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not rip, or tuft of wool that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not pick to pieces, lest anything should escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousness excited in him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) by the discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a hundred; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found no more booty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) held the blanket flights, balsam vomits, stake benedictions, carriers' fisticuffs, missing alforjas, stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, and weariness he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had endured in the service of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) good master, cheap at the price; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) considered himself more than fully indemnified for all by the payment he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) received in the gift of the treasure-trove.
<p/>The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find out who the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet and letter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts, that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could inquire, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) saw nothing else for it but to push on, taking whatever road Rocinante chose--which was where he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could make his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) way--firmly persuaded that among these wilds he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could not fail to meet some rare adventure.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) went along, then, occupied with these thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) perceived on the summit of a height that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock to tussock with marvellous agility.
<p/>As well as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could make out he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs and feet, his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet but so ragged that they showed his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) skin in several places.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) passed as has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance observed and noted all these trifles, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) made the attempt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was unable to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), for it was not granted to the feebleness of Rocinante to make way over such rough ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish by nature.
<p/>Don Quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise, and made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mind to go in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should have to wander a year in those mountains before he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) directed Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself went by the other, and perhaps by this means they might light upon this man who had passed so quickly out of their sight.
<p/>I could not do that,'' said Sancho, ``for when I separate from your worship fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of panics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this time forth I am not going to stir a finger's width from your presence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of the Rueful Countenance, ``and I am very glad that thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never fail thee, even though the soul in thy body fail thee
<p/>; so come on now behind me slowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let us make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man that we saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found.
<p/>To which Sancho made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Far better would it be not to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), for, if we find him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) happens to be the owner of the money
<p/>, it is plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that without taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it until in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it, and then the king will hold me harmless.
<p/>Thou art wrong there, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for now that we have a suspicion who the owner is, and have him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) almost before us, we are bound to seek him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) and make restitution; and if we do not see him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), the strong suspicion we have as to his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) being the owner makes us as guilty as if he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) give thee any uneasiness, for if we find him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) it will relieve mine.
<p/>And so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on foot and loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still further strengthened their suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who had fled was the owner of the mule and the saddle-pad.
<p/>As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd watching his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared a great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' Don Quixote called aloud to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to come down to where they stood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or never trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other wild beasts that roamed around.
<p/>The goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead in the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six months; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have come upon nobody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``nor on anything except a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I found it too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div>said the goatherd, <div class="bookquote">``but I would not lift it nor go near it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the devil is crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to make one fall without knowing why or wherefore.
<p/>That's exactly what I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I found it too, and I would not go within a stone's throw of it
<p/>; there I left it, and there it lies just as it was, for I don't want a dog with a bell.
<p/>Sancho in return bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) come down, and they would explain all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, good man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``do you know who is the owner of this property?
<p/>All I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the goatherd, <div class="bookquote">``is that about six months ago, more or less, there arrived at a shepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps, away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on that same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and valise which you say you found and did not touch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) asked us what part of this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) that it was where we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a league farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and I am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road or path that leads to this spot.
<p/>I say, then, that on hearing our answer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), leaving us all charmed with his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) good looks, and wondering at his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) question and the haste with which we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) depart in the direction of the sierra; and after that we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) no more, until some days afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and without saying a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) several cuffs and kicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness.
<p/>When some of us goatherds learned this we went in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) for about two days through the most remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) came out to meet us with great gentleness, with his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) dress now torn and his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) face so disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) but that his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we had of them, that he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was the person we were looking for.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) saluted us courteously, and in a few well-spoken words he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) told us not to wonder at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) might work out a penance which for his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) many sins had been imposed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>).
<p/>We asked him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) to tell us who he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was, but we were never able to find out from him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>): we begged of him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) too, when he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was in want of food, which he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) could not do without, to tell us where we should find him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), as we would bring it to him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) with all good-will and readiness; or if this were not to his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) taste, at least to come and ask it of us and not take it by force from the shepherds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) thanked us for the offer, begged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to ask it in God's name without offering violence to anybody.
<p/>As for fixed abode, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had no other than that which chance offered wherever night might overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words ended in an outburst of weeping so bitter that we who listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must have been very stones had we not joined him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in it, comparing what we saw of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the first time with what we saw now
<p/>; for, as I said, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a graceful and gracious youth, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good birth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), even to our rusticity his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gentle bearing sufficed to make it plain.
<p/>But in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stopped and became silent, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which we stood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this abstraction; and with no little pity, for from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) behaviour, now staring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving an eyelid, again closing them, compressing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips and raising his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and before long he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) showed that what we imagined was the truth, for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arose in a fury from the ground where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had thrown himself, and attacked the first he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) found near him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with such rage and fierceness that if we had not dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) off him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have beaten or bitten him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to death, all the while exclaiming, `Oh faithless Fernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou
<p/>hast done me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, abode and dwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and to these he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando and charging him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) with treachery and faithlessness.
<p/>We forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) to release his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) hold with no little difficulty, and without another word he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) left us, and rushing off plunged in among these brakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>); from this we suppose that madness comes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) from time to time, and that some one called Fernando must have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) a wrong of a grievous nature such as the condition to which it had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) seemed to show.
<p/>All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions, and they have been many, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) has crossed our path, at one time to beg the shepherds to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) some of the food they carry, at another to take it from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), even though the shepherds offer it freely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) will not accept it but snatches it from them by dint of blows; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) senses he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) begs it for the love of God, courteously and civilly, and receives it with many thanks and not a few tears.
<p/>I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and the other two friends of mine, to go in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) until we find him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and when we do to take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), whether by force or of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own consent, to the town of Almodovar, which is eight leagues from this, and there strive to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) -LRB-if indeed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) malady admits of a cure-RRB-, or learn when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) senses who he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has relatives to whom we may give notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) misfortune.
<p/>This, sirs, is all I can say in answer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of the articles you found is he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and so naked.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' And to tell you the truth, sirs,'' continued the goatherd, <div class="bookquote">``it was yesterday that we resolved, ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div><p/>For Don Quixote had already described how he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had seen the man go bounding along the mountain side, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was now filled with amazement at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to discover who the unhappy madman was; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) resolved, as he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) had done before, to search for him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) all over the mountain, not leaving a corner or cave unexamined until he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) had found him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>).
<p/>But chance arranged matters better than he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) expected or hoped, for at that very moment, in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood, the youth he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) wished to find made his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) appearance, coming along talking to himself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) garb was what has been described, save that as he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) drew near, Don Quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wore was amber-tanned, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank.
<p/>Don Quixote returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) salutation with equal politeness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred bearing and grace to embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for some time close in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arms as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for a long time.
<p/>The other, whom we may call the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the Rueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back a little and, placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hands on Don Quixote's shoulders, stood gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as if seeking to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), not less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>To be brief, the first to speak after embracing was the Ragged One, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said what will be told farther on.
<p/>Approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but with great courtesy. CHAPTER XXIV. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA MORENA
<p/>The history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixote listened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying: <div class="bookquote">``Of a surety, senor, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you for the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would I were in a condition to requite with something more than good-will that which you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me; but my fate does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses done me save the hearty desire to repay them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the knight</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``is to be of service to you, so much so that I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you, and learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for that sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour; and to search for you with all possible diligence, if search had been necessary.
<p/>And if your misfortune should prove to be one of those that refuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was my purpose to join you in lamenting and mourning over it, so far as I could; for it is still some comfort in misfortune to find one who can feel for it.
<p/>And if my good intentions deserve to be acknowledged with any kind of courtesy, I entreat you, senor, by that which I perceive you possess in so high a degree, and likewise conjure you by whatever you love or have loved best in life, to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a brute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to your condition as your garb and appearance show.
<p/>And I swear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>added Don Quixote, ``by the order of knighthood which I have received, and by my vocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you with all the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving your misfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it as I promised to do.
<p/>The Knight of the Thicket, hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) of the Rueful Countenance talk in this strain, did nothing but stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), and stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) again, and again survey him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) from head to foot; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) had thoroughly examined him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>): ``If you have anything to give me to eat, for God's sake give it me, and after I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the goodwill you have displayed towards me.
<p/>Sancho from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sack, and the goatherd from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pouch, furnished the Ragged One with the means of appeasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hunger, and what they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) took no time between mouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ate neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) nor they who observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) uttered a word.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had done he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) made signs to them to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), which they did, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) led them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock.
<p/>On reaching it he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stretched himself upon the grass, and the others did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One, settling himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) place, said: ``If it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words the surpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break the thread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for the instant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end.
<p/>These words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed the river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to the Ragged One, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went on to say: ``I give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story of my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to add fresh ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end of the recital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of importance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity.
<p/>Don Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this assurance he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began as follows: <div class="bookquote">``My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this Andalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great that my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven.
<p/>In that same country there was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could desire; such was the beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich as I, but of happier fortunes, and of less firmness than was due to so worthy a passion as mine.
<p/>This Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored from my earliest and tenderest years, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood.
<p/>Our parents were aware of our feelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for they saw clearly that as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us, a thing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families and wealth.
<p/>We grew up, and with our growth grew the love between us, so that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety's sake to refuse me admission to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house, in this perhaps imitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and this refusal but added love to love and flame to flame; for though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it upon our pens, which can make known the heart's secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues; for many a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Ah heavens! how many letters did I write her (<font color='blue'><b>poets</b></font>), and how many dainty modest replies did I receive!
<p/>how many ditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and made known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled in its recollections and dallied with its desires!
<p/>At length growing impatient and feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her (<font color='blue'><b>poets</b></font>), I resolved to put into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of winning my desired and merited reward, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>poets</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>poets</b></font>) father for my lawful wife, which I did.
<p/>To this his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answer was that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thanked me for the disposition I showed to do honour to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and to regard myself as honoured by the bestowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) treasure; but that as my father was alive it was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by right to make this demand, for if it were not in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be taken or given by stealth.
<p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kindness, reflecting that there was reason in what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, and that my father would assent to it as soon as I should tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and with that view I went the very same instant to let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) know what my desires were.
<p/>When I entered the room where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was I found him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with an open letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand, which, before I could utter a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave me, saying, `By this letter thou wilt see, Cardenio, the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve thee.'
<p/>This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs, probably know already, is a grandee of Spain who has his (<font color='blue'><b>Ricardo</b></font>) seat in the best part of this Andalusia.
<p/>I took and read the letter, which was couched in terms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke made in it, which was that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would send me immediately to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wished me to become the companion, not servant, of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge of placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held me.
<p/>On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I heard my father say, `Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in accordance with the duke's wish, and give thanks to God who is opening a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost deserve; and to these words he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) added others of fatherly counsel.
<p/>The time for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) all that had occurred, as I did also to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) father, entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ricardo</b></font>) gave me the promise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered.
<p/>Finally, I presented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Ricardo</b></font>) so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants growing envious of me, and regarding the duke's inclination to show me favour as an injury to themselves.
<p/>But the one to whom my arrival gave the greatest pleasure was the duke's second son, Fernando by name, a gallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody; for though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not carry his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando.
<p/>It so happened, then, that as between friends no secret remains unshared, and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) made all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) thoughts known to me, and in particular a love affair which troubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) mind a little.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was deeply in love with a peasant girl, a vassal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) father's, the daughter of wealthy parents, and herself so beautiful, modest, discreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was able to decide in which of these respects she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was most highly gifted or most excelled.
<p/>The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernando to such a point that, in order to gain his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) object and overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) virtuous resolutions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) determined to pledge his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) word to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to become her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt an impossibility.
<p/>I could think of to restrain and dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) from such a course; but perceiving I produced no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ricardo</b></font>) father, acquainted with the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd, foresaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a good servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to the honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) could find no better way of effacing from his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) mind the beauty that so enslaved him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) than by absenting himself for some months, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) wished the absence to be effected by our going, both of us, to my father's house under the pretence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would make to the duke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my city, which produces the best in the world.
<p/>When I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say so, even if his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) resolution had not been so good a one I should have hailed it as one of the happiest that could be imagined, prompted by my affection, seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offered me of returning to see my Luscinda.
<p/>With this thought and wish I commended his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) idea and encouraged his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) design, advising him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to put it into execution as quickly as possible, as, in truth, absence produced its effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings.
<p/>But, as afterwards appeared, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said this to me he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had already enjoyed the peasant girl under the title of husband, and was waiting for an opportunity of making it known with safety to himself, being in dread of what his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father the duke would do when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came to know of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) folly.
<p/>It happened, then, that as with young men love is for the most part nothing more than appetite, which, as its final object is enjoyment, comes to an end on obtaining it, and that which seemed to be love takes to flight, as it cannot pass the limit fixed by nature, which fixes no limit to true love--
<p/>what I mean is that after Don Fernando had enjoyed this peasant girl his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) passion subsided and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) eagerness cooled, and if at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) feigned a wish to absent himself in order to cure his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) love, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was now in reality anxious to go to avoid keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) promise.
<p/>The duke gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) permission, and ordered me to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>); we arrived at my city, and my father gave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the reception due to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rank; I saw Luscinda without delay, and, though it had not been dead or deadened, my love gathered fresh life.
<p/>To my sorrow I told the story of it to Don Fernando, for I thought that in virtue of the great friendship he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) bore me
<p/>Bound to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) as I was by friendship, I strove by the best arguments and the most forcible examples '' I was bound to conceal nothing from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>).
<p/>I extolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) beauty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) gaiety, her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) wit, so warmly, that my praises excited in him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) a desire to see a damsel adorned by such attractions.
<p/>To my misfortune I yielded to it, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) one night by the light of a taper at a window where we used to talk to one another.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) dressing-gown, she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) drove all the beauties he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had seen until then out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) recollection; speech failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) head turned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was spell-bound, and in the end love-smitten, as you will see in the course of the story of my misfortune; and to inflame still further his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) passion, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) hid from me and revealed to Heaven alone, it so happened that one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) found a note of hers entreating me to demand her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) father in marriage, so delicate, so modest, and so tender, that on reading it he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me that in Luscinda alone were combined all the charms of beauty and understanding that were distributed among all the other women in the world.
<p/>It is true, and I own it now, that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had to praise Luscinda, it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) mouth, and I began to fear, and with reason to feel distrust of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), for there was no moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was not ready to talk of Luscinda, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) would start the subject himself even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) dragged it in unseasonably, a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of jealousy; not that I feared any change in the constancy or faith of Luscinda; but still my fate led me to forebode what she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) assured me against.
<p/>Don Fernando contrived always to read the letters I sent to Luscinda and her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) answers to me, under the pretence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) enjoyed the wit and sense of both.
<p/>It so happened, then, that Luscinda having begged of me a book of chivalry to read, one that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was very fond of, Amadis of Gaul-
<p/>'' Don Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady Luscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would have been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) understanding, for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for such delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned, you need waste no more words in describing her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) beauty, worth, and intelligence; for, on merely hearing what her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) taste was, I declare her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) to be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world; and I wish your worship had, along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the worthy Don Rugel of Greece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish Daraida and Garaya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel, and the admirable verses of his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) bucolics, sung and delivered by him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) with such sprightliness, wit, and ease; but a time may come when this omission can be remedied, and to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my village, for there I can give you more than three hundred books which are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life;--though it occurs to me that I have not got one of them now, thanks to the spite of wicked and envious enchanters;--but
<p/>pardon me for having broken the promise we made not to interrupt your discourse; for when I hear chivalry or knights-errant mentioned, I can no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat, or those of the moon moisture; pardon me, therefore, and proceed, for that is more to the purpose now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head to fall upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) breast, and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice Don Quixote bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) neither looked up nor uttered a word in reply; but after some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head and said, ``I cannot get rid of the idea, nor will anyone in the world remove it, or make me think otherwise--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would be a blockhead who would hold or believe anything else than that that arrant knave Master Elisabad made free with Queen Madasima.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not true, by all that's good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote in high wrath, turning upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) angrily, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) way was; <div class="bookquote">``and it is a very great slander, or rather villainy.
<p/>Queen Madasima was a very illustrious lady, and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would have made free with a quack; and whoever maintains the contrary lies like a great scoundrel, and I will give him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) to know it, on foot or on horseback, armed or unarmed, by night or by day, or as he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) likes best.
<p/>Cardenio was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) steadily, and his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) mad fit having now come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) had no disposition to go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) story, nor would Don Quixote have listened to it,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' so much had what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had heard about Madasima disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>). Strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stood up for her (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)
<p/>Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard himself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting names, not relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found near him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and with it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote's breast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back.
<p/>Sancho Panza, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master treated in this fashion, attacked the madman with his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) closed fist; but the Ragged One received him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) in such a way that with a blow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) fist he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) stretched him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) feet, and then mounting upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) crushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ribs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) own satisfaction; the goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having beaten and pummelled them all he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) left them and quietly withdrew to his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) hiding-place on the mountain.
<p/>Sancho rose, and with the rage he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt at finding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran to take vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of not giving them warning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves.
<p/>The goatherd replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had said so, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had not heard him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), that was no fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>).
<p/>Sancho retorted, and the goatherd rejoined, and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the beard, and exchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made peace between them, they would have knocked one another to pieces.
<p/>as if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) were in earnest his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) veritable born lady; to such a pass had his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) unholy books brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>). ''
<p/>Leave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance,'' said Sancho, grappling with the goatherd, <div class="bookquote">``for of this fellow, who is a clown like myself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for the affront he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) has offered me, fighting with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand to hand like an honest man.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div>'' That is true,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is not to blame for what has happened.
<p/>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would be possible to find Cardenio, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) felt the greatest anxiety to know the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) story.
<p/>The goatherd told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) before, that there was no knowing of a certainty where his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lair was; but that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wandered about much in that neighbourhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not fail to fall in with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) either in or out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) senses.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OF LA MANCHA IN THE SIERRA MORENA,
<p/>AND OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>MANCHA</b></font>) IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OF BELTENEBROS Don Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting Rocinante bade Sancho follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) having no ass, did very discontentedly.
<p/>They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most rugged part of the mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, and longing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to begin, so that there should be no breach of the injunction laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but unable to keep silence so long he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Senor Don Quixote, give me your worship's blessing and dismissal, for I'd like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can at any rate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to go through these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have a mind is burying me alive.
<p/>If luck would have it that animals spoke as they did in the days of Guisopete, it would not be so bad, because I could talk to Rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up with my ill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne with patience, to go seeking adventures all one's life and get nothing but kicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have to sew up one's mouth without daring to say what is in one's heart, just as if one were dumb.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand thee, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``thou art dying to have the interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it removed, and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains.
<p/>So be it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``let me speak now, for God knows what will happen by-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, I ask, what made your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers or not?
<p/>for if your worship had let that pass--and you were not a judge in the matter--it is my belief the madman would have gone on with his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) story, and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more than half a dozen cuffs would have been escaped.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Queen Madasima was, I know thou wouldst say I had great patience that I did not break in pieces the mouth that uttered such blasphemies, for a very great blasphemy it is to say or imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon.
<p/>The truth of the story is that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of great prudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and physician to the queen, but to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) mistress is nonsense deserving very severe punishment; and as a proof that Cardenio did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) was saying, remember when he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) said it he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) wits.''
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``In faith, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``if thou knewest as I do what an honourable and illustrious lady ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>thou art stringing together! What has what we are talking about got to do with the proverbs '' And is it very perilous, this achievement?''
<p/>No,'' replied he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) of the Rueful Countenance; <div class="bookquote">``though it may be in the dice that we may throw deuce-ace instead of sixes; but all will depend on thy diligence.
<p/>Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for if thou dost return soon from the place where I mean to send thee, my penance will be soon over, and my glory will soon begin.
<p/>But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in suspense, waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have thee know, Sancho, that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect knights-errant--I am wrong to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) was one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) stood alone, the first, the only one, the lord of all that were in the world in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) time.
<p/>A fig for Don Belianis, and for all who say he (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) equalled him (<font color='blue'><b>Belianis</b></font>) in any respect, for, my oath upon it, they are deceiving themselves!
<p/>I say, too, that when a painter desires to become famous in his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) art he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) endeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters that he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) knows; and the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and callings that serve to adorn a state; thus must he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) who would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses, in whose person and labours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience; as Virgil, too, shows us in the person of AEneas the virtue of a pious son and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain; not representing or describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, so as to leave the example of their virtues to posterity.
<p/>In the same way Amadis was the polestar, day-star, sun of valiant and devoted knights, whom all we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to imitate.
<p/>This, then, being so, I consider, friend Sancho, that the knight-errant who shall imitate him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) most closely will come nearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry.
<p/>Now one of the instances in which this knight most conspicuously showed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) prudence, worth, valour, endurance, fortitude, and love, was when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) withdrew, rejected by the Lady Oriana, to do penance upon the Pena Pobre, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pobre</b></font>) name into that of Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and appropriate to the life which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pobre</b></font>) had voluntarily adopted.
<p/>So, as it is easier for me to imitate him (<font color='blue'><b>Pobre</b></font>) in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting off serpents' heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets, and breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well suited for a similar purpose, I must not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently offers me its forelock.

'' I have the basin in my sack <div class="bookquote">``Look here, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``by him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>)
<p/>thou didst swear by just now I swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in the world has or ever had.
<p/>thou hast never found out that all things belonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and ravings, and to go always by contraries?
<p/>And not because it really is so, but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us that change and alter everything with us, and turn things as they please, and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us; thus what seems to thee a barber's basin seems to me Mambrino's helmet, and to another it will seem something else; and rare foresight it was in the sage who is on my side to make what is really and truly Mambrine's helmet seem a basin to everybody, for, being held in such estimation as it is, all the world would pursue me to rob me of it; but when they see it is only a barber's basin
<p/>they do not take the trouble to obtain it; as was plainly shown by him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) who tried to break it, and left it on the ground without taking it, for, by my faith, had he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) known it he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) would never have left it behind.
<p/>Keep it safe, my friend, for just now I have no need of it; indeed, I shall have to take off all this armour and remain as naked as I was born, if I have a mind to follow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance.
<p/>Thus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like an isolated peak among the others that surrounded it.
<p/>Past its base there flowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green and luxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and forest trees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to the charms of the spot.
<p/>Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) choice for the performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) penance, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) beheld it exclaimed in a loud voice as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) were out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) senses:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose for bewailing the misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me: this is the spot where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters of yon little brook, and my deep and endless sighs shall stir unceasingly the leaves of these mountain trees, in testimony and token of the pain my persecuted heart is suffering.
<p/>Oh, ye rural deities, whoever ye be that haunt this lone spot, give ear to the complaint of a wretched lover whom long absence and brooding jealousy have driven to bewail his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fate among these wilds and complain of the hard heart of that fair and ungrateful one, the end and limit of all human beauty!

<p/>, so may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooed never disturb your sweet repose, help me to lament my hard fate or at least weary not at listening to it!
<p/>Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso, day of my night, glory of my pain, guide of my path, star of my fortune, so may Heaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it, bethink thee of the place and condition to which absence from thee has brought me, and make that return in kindness that is due to my fidelity!
<p/>Oh, lonely trees, that from this day forward shall bear me company in my solitude, give me some sign by the gentle movement of your boughs that my presence is not distasteful to you!
<p/>what thou shalt see me do here, so that thou mayest relate and report it to the sole cause of all,'' and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) dismounted from Rocinante, and in an instant relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) of saddle and bridle, and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) a slap on the croup, said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) gives thee freedom who is bereft of it himself, oh steed as excellent in deed as thou art unfortunate in thy lot; begone where thou wilt, for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neither Astolfo's hippogriff, nor the famed Frontino that cost Bradamante so dear, could equal thee in speed.

<p/>as well as I recollect Dulcinea '' So, so!'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``Lorenzo Corchuelo's daughter is the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) it is,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) it is that is worthy to be lady of the whole universe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and let me tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can fling a crowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town.
<p/>but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a brave lass, and a right and stout one, and fit to be helpmate to any knight-errant that is or is to be, who may make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lady: the whoreson wench, what sting she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has and what a voice!
<p/>I can tell you one day she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to call some labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father's, and though they were better than half a league off they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as well as if they were at the foot of the tower; and the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not a bit prudish, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has plenty of affability, and jokes with everybody, and has a grin and a jest for everything.
<p/>So, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, I say you not only may and ought to do mad freaks for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sake, but you have a good right to give way to despair and hang yourself; and no one who knows of it but will say you did well, though the devil should take you; and I wish I were on my road already, simply to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), for it is many a day since I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be altered by this time, for going about the fields always, and the sun and the air spoil women's looks greatly.
<p/>But I must own the truth to your worship, Senor Don Quixote; until now I have been under a great mistake, for I believed truly and honestly that the lady Dulcinea must be some princess your worship was in love with, or some person great enough to deserve the rich presents you have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), such as the Biscayan and the galley slaves, and many more no doubt, for your worship must have won many victories in the time when I was not yet your squire.
<p/>But all things considered, what good can it do the lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, to have the vanquished your worship sends or will send coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) and going down on their knees before her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>)?
<p/>Because may be when they came she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>)'d be hackling flax or threshing on the threshing floor, and they'd be ashamed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>)'d laugh, or resent the present.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have before now told thee many times, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that thou art a mighty great chatterer, and that with a blunt wit thou art always striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art and how rational I am, I would have thee listen to a short story.
<p/>Thou must know that a certain widow, fair, young, independent, and rich, and above all free and easy, fell in love with a sturdy strapping young lay-brother; his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) superior came to know of it, and one day said to the worthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance, 'I am surprised, senora, and not without good reason, that a woman of such high standing, so fair, and so rich as you are, should have fallen in love with such a mean, low, stupid fellow as So-and-so, when in this house there are so many masters, graduates, and divinity students from among whom you might choose as if they were a lot of pears, saying this one I'll take, that I won't take;' but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied to him (<font color='blue'><b>So-and-so</b></font>) with great sprightliness and candour, `My dear sir, you are very much mistaken, and your ideas are very old-fashioned, if you think that I have made a bad choice in So-and-so, fool as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) seems; because for all I want with him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) knows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle.'
<p/>In the same way, Sancho, for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is just as good as the most exalted princess on earth.
<p/>It is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they give them, had any such mistresses.
<p/>Thinkest thou that the Amarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the Dianas, the Galateas, the Filidas, and all the rest of them, that the books, the ballads, the barber's shops, the theatres are full of, were really and truly ladies of flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify and have glorified them?
<p/>; they only invent them for the most part to furnish a subject for their verses, and that they may pass for lovers, or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it suffices me to think and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous; and as to her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) pedigree it is very little matter, for no one will examine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>), and I, for my part, reckon her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) the most exalted princess in the world.
<p/>For thou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not know, that two things alone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these are great beauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found in Dulcinea in the highest degree, for in beauty
<p/>no one equals her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) and in good name few approach her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>); and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, I persuade myself that all I say is as I say, neither more nor less, and I picture her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) in my imagination as I would have her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) to be, as well in beauty as in condition; Helen approaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) not nor does Lucretia come up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>), nor any other of the famous women of times past, Greek, Barbarian, or Latin; and let each say what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will, for if in this I am taken to task by the ignorant, I shall not be censured by the critical.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Giver of all good! Nothing of the kind <div class="bookquote">``I say that your worship is entirely right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``and that I am an ass.
<p/>But I know not how the name of ass came into my mouth, for a rope is not to be mentioned in the house of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who has been hanged; but now for the letter, and then, God be with you, I am off.
<p/>Don Quixote took out the note-book, and, retiring to one side, very deliberately began to write the letter, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had finished it he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) called to Sancho, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wished to read it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might commit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evil fortune like his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) anything might be apprehended.
<p/>To which Sancho replied, <div class="bookquote">``Write it two or three times there in the book and give it to me, and I will carry it very carefully, because to expect me to keep it in my memory is all nonsense, for I have such a bad one that I often forget my own name; but for all that repeat it to me, as I shall like to hear it, for surely it will run as if it was in print.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sovereign and exalted Lady,--The pierced by the point of absence, the wounded to the heart's core, sends thee, sweetest Dulcinea del Toboso, the health that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) himself enjoys not.

<p/>My good squire Sancho will relate to thee in full, fair ingrate, dear enemy, the condition to which I am reduced on thy account: if it be thy pleasure to give me relief, I am thine; if not, do as may be pleasing to thee; for by ending my life I shall satisfy thy cruelty and my desire. ''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what I am afraid of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho upon this; <div class="bookquote">``that I shall not be able to find my way back to this spot where I am leaving you, it is such an out-of-the-way place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Observe the landmarks well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for I will try not to go far from this neighbourhood, and I will even take care to mount the highest of these rocks to see if I can discover thee returning; however, not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut some branches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thou goest to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain; these will serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth of Theseus, as marks and signs for finding me on thy return.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>So I will,'' said Sancho Panza, and having cut some, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master's blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), and mounting Rocinante, of whom Don Quixote charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) earnestly to have as much care as of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own person, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) set out for the plain, strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master had recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) way, though Don Quixote still entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) do were it only a couple of mad acts.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had not gone a hundred paces, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) returned and said: <div class="bookquote">``I must say, senor, your worship said quite right, that in order to be able to swear without a weight on my conscience that I had seen you do mad things, it would be well for me to see if it were only one; though in your worship's remaining here I have seen a very great one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let not that anxiety trouble thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for even if I had it ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' Did I not tell thee so?'' said Don Quixote.
<p/>Wait, Sancho, and I will do them in the saying of a credo,'' and pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) breeches in all haste he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stripped himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) skin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shirt, and then, without more ado, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cut a couple of gambados in the air, and a couple of somersaults, heels over head, making such a display that, not to see it a second time, Sancho wheeled Rocinante round, and felt easy, and satisfied in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could swear he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master mad; and so we will leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) road until his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) return, which was a quick one.
<p/>'' CHAPTER XXVI. IN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE REFINEMENTS WHEREWITH DON QUIXOTE PLAYED THE PART OF A LOVER IN THE SIERRA MORENA
<p/>Returning to the proceedings of him (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) of the Rueful Countenance when he (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) found himself alone, the history says that when Don Quixote had completed the performance of the somersaults or capers, naked from the waist down and clothed from the waist up, and saw that Sancho had gone off without waiting to see any more crazy feats, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) climbed up to the top of a high rock, and there set himself to consider what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had several times before considered without ever coming to any conclusion on the point, namely whether it would be better and more to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) purpose to imitate the outrageous madness of Roland, or the melancholy madness of Amadis; and communing with himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``What wonder is it if Roland was so good a knight and so valiant as everyone says he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) was, when, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) was enchanted, and nobody could kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) foot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) always wore shoes with seven iron soles?
<p/>Though cunning devices did not avail him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) against Bernardo del Carpio, who knew all about them, and strangled him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) arms at Roncesvalles.
<p/>But putting the question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) valour aside, let us come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) wits, for certain it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) did lose them in consequence of the proofs he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) discovered at the fountain, and the intelligence the shepherd gave him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) of Angelica having slept more than two siestas with Medoro, a little curly-headed Moor, and page to Agramante.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was persuaded that this was true, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) lady had wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>), it is no wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) should have gone mad; but I, how am I to imitate him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) madness, unless I can imitate him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) in the cause of it?
<p/>For my Dulcinea, I will venture to swear, never saw a Moor in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) is, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) proper costume, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is this day as the mother that bore her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and I should plainly be doing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a wrong if, fancying anything else, I were to go mad with the same kind of madness as Roland the Furious.
<p/>On the other hand, I see that Amadis of Gaul, without losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) senses and without doing anything mad, acquired as a lover as much fame as the most famous; for, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) history, on finding himself rejected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) lady Oriana, who had ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) not to appear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Oriana</b></font>) presence until it should be her (<font color='blue'><b>Oriana</b></font>) pleasure, all he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) did was to retire to the Pena Pobre in company with a hermit, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Pena</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Pena</b></font>) fill of weeping until Heaven sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Pena</b></font>) relief in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pena</b></font>) great grief and need.
<p/>And if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the trouble to strip stark naked, or do mischief to these trees which have done me no harm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which will give me to drink whenever I have a mind?
<p/>Long live the memory of Amadis and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pena</b></font>) be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of La Mancha, of whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) did not achieve great things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) died in attempting them; and if I am not repulsed or rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as I have said, to be absent from her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
<p/>And so, now to business; come to my memory ye deeds of Amadis, and show me how I am to begin to imitate you.
<p/>I know already that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) chiefly did was to pray and commend himself to God; but what am I to do for a rosary, for I have not got one?
<p/>And then it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might make one, and that was by tearing a great strip off the tail of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shirt which hung down, and making eleven knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this served him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for a rosary all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was there, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated countless ave-marias.
<p/>But what distressed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) greatly was not having another hermit there to confess him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and receive consolation from; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) solaced himself with pacing up and down the little meadow, and writing and carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a multitude of verses all in harmony with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sadness, and some in praise of Dulcinea; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was found there afterwards, the only ones completely legible that could be discovered were those that follow here:
<p/>Ye on the mountain side that grow, Ye green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes, Are ye aweary of the woe That this poor aching bosom crushes?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If it disturb you, and I owe Some reparation, it may be a Defence for me to let you know
<p/>The lealest lover time can show, Doomed for a lady-love to languish, Among these solitudes doth go, A prey to every kind of anguish.
<p/>Don Quixote's tears are on the flow, And all for distant Dulcinea Del Toboso. Why Love should like a spiteful foe
<p/>Thus use him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) hath no idea, But hogsheads full--this doth he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) know-- Don Quixote's tears are on the flow, And
<p/>all for distant Dulcinea Del Toboso. Adventure-seeking doth he (<font color='blue'><b>Del</b></font>) go Up rugged heights, down rocky valleys, But hill or dale, or high or low
<p/>, Mishap attendeth all his (<font color='blue'><b>Del</b></font>) sallies: Love still pursues him (<font color='blue'><b>Del</b></font>) to and fro, And plies his (<font color='blue'><b>Del</b></font>) cruel scourge--ah me! a Relentless fate, an endless woe
<p/>The addition of <div class="bookquote">``Del Toboso''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>to Dulcinea's name gave rise to no little laughter among those who found the above lines, for they suspected Don Quixote must have fancied that unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) added <div class="bookquote">``del Toboso''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) introduced the name of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible; which was indeed the fact, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself afterwards admitted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wrote many more, but, as has been said, these three verses were all that could be plainly and perfectly deciphered.
<p/>In this way, and in sighing and calling on the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams, and Echo, moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), as well as in looking for herbs to sustain him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) time until Sancho's return; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it was three days, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance would have worn such an altered countenance that the mother that bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) would not have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>): and here it will be well to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), wrapped up in sighs and verses, to relate how Sancho Panza fared on his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) mission.
<p/>As for him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), coming out upon the high road, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) made for El Toboso, and the next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>).
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) recognised it he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) were once more living through the air, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) could not bring himself to enter it though it was an hour when he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) might well have done so, for it was dinner-time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) longed to taste something hot as it had been all cold fare with him (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) for many days past.
<p/>This craving drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) to draw near to the inn, still undecided whether to go in or not, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) was hesitating there came out two persons who at once recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>), and said one to the other: <div class="bookquote">``Senor licentiate, is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) on the horse there Sancho Panza who, our adventurer's housekeeper told us, went off with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) master as esquire?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>; Don Quixote's tears are on the flow, And all for distant Dulcinea Del Toboso. '' So it is,'' said the licentiate, <div class="bookquote">``and that is our friend Don Quixote's horse;''  (<font color='red'><b>the licentiate horse</b></font>)</div>and if they knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>)
<p/>so well it was because they were the curate and the barber of his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) own village, the same who had carried out the scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of Don Quixote, they approached, and calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) name
<p/>Sancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place and circumstances where and under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) replied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain matter of great importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not disclose for the eyes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head.
<p/>Nay, nay,'' said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``if you don't tell us where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is, Sancho Panza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered and robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), for here you are mounted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) horse; in fact, you must produce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.
<p/>There is no need of threats with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for I am not a man to rob or murder anybody; let his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own fate, or God who made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), kill each one; my master is engaged very much to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) taste doing penance in the midst of these mountains;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and then, offhand and without stopping, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) told them how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), what adventures had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the daughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) was over head and ears in love.
<p/>They were both amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though they were aware of Don Quixote's madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder.
<p/>the curate said, <div class="bookquote">``Friend Sancho Panza, where is your master?''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' They then asked Sancho Panza to show them the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was carrying to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) said it was written in a note-book, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master's directions were that he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) should have it copied on paper at the first village he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) came to.
<p/>Sancho put his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bosom in search of the note-book but could not find it, nor, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had been searching until now, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) have found it, for Don Quixote had kept it, and had never given it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), nor
<p/>On this the curate said if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) showed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself would make a fair copy of it. had he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself thought of asking for it.
<p/>When Sancho discovered he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not find the book his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) face grew deadly pale, and in great haste he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) again felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) body all over, and seeing plainly it was not to be found, without more ado he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beard with both hands and plucked away half of it, and then, as quick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could and without stopping, gave himself half a dozen cuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood.
<p/>Seeing this, the curate and the barber asked him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) what had happened him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) gave himself such rough treatment. ''
<p/>'' replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but to have lost from one hand to the other, in a moment, three ass-colts, each of them like a castle?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>I have lost the note-book,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that contained the letter to Dulcinea, and an order signed by my master in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) niece to give me three ass-colts out of four or five he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had at home;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) then told them about the loss of Dapple.
<p/>The curate consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was found he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would get him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, as was honoured.
<p/>Sancho comforted himself with this, and said if that were so the loss of Dulcinea's letter did not trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) much, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had it almost by heart, and it could be taken down from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wherever and whenever they liked.
<p/>What should happen me? <div class="bookquote">``How is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber. '' '' Repeat it then, Sancho,'' said the barber, ``and we will write it down afterwards.
<p/>Sancho Panza stopped to scratch his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) head to bring back the letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) memory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the other, one moment staring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after having half gnawed off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) to begin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) said, after a long pause, <div class="bookquote">``By God, senor licentiate, devil a thing can I recollect of the letter; but it said at the beginning, `Exalted and scrubbing Lady.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That is it,'' said Sancho; ``then, as well as I remember, it went on, `The wounded, and wanting of sleep, and the pierced, kisses your worship's hands, ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it said something or other about health and sickness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Exalted</b></font>); and from that it went tailing off until it ended with `Yours till death, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.
<p/>It gave them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good memory Sancho had, and they complimented him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) greatly upon it, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to repeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they too might get it by heart to write it out by-and-by.
<p/>Sancho repeated it three times, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did, uttered three thousand more absurdities; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) told them more about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) never said a word about the blanketing that had befallen himself in that inn, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) refused to enter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) told them, moreover, how his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lord, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a favourable answer from the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to put himself in the way of endeavouring to become an emperor, or at least a monarch; for it had been so settled between them, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) personal worth and the might of his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) arm
<p/>it was an easy matter to come to be one: and how on becoming one his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) lord was to make a marriage for him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>)
<p/>-LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) would be a widower by that time, as a matter of course-RRB- and was to give him (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) as a wife one of the damsels of the empress, the heiress of some rich and grand state on the mainland, having nothing to do with islands of any sort, for he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) did not care for them now.
<p/>All this Sancho delivered with so much composure--wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) nose from time to time--and with so little common-sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) two hearers were again filled with wonder at the force of Don Quixote's madness that could run away with this poor man's reason.
<p/>They did not care to take the trouble of disabusing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) error, as they considered that since it did not in any way hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conscience it would be better to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in it, and they would have all the more amusement in listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simplicities; and so they bade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pray to God for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lord's health, as it was a very likely and a very feasible thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in course of time to come to be an emperor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) said, or at least an archbishop or some other dignitary of equal rank.
<p/>To which Sancho made answer, <div class="bookquote">``If fortune, sirs, should bring things about in such a way that my master should have a mind, instead of being an emperor, to be an archbishop, I should like to know what archbishops-errant commonly give their squires?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They commonly give them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate benefice place</b></font>)</div>said the curate, some simple benefice or cure, or some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income, not counting the altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much more.''
<p/>But for that,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``the squire must be unmarried, and must know, at any rate, how to help at mass, and if that be so, woe is me, for I am married already
<p/>and I don't know the first letter of the A B C. What will become of me if my master takes a fancy to be an archbishop and not an emperor, as is usual and customary with knights-errant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be not uneasy, friend Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``for we will entreat your master, and advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), even urging it upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) as a case of conscience, to become an emperor and not an archbishop, because it will be easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) is more valiant than lettered.
<p/>So I have thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``though I can tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is fit for anything: what I mean to do for my part is to pray to our Lord to place him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) where it may be best for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) may be able to bestow most favours upon me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak like a man of sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``and you will be acting like a good Christian; but what must now be done is to take steps to coax your master out of that useless penance you say he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is performing; and we had best turn into this inn to consider what plan to adopt, and also to dine, for it is now time.

<p/>Sancho said they might go in, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would wait there outside, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would tell them afterwards the reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was unwilling, and why it did not suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to enter it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) begged them to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) out something to eat, and to let it be hot, and also to bring barley for Rocinante.
<p/>By-and-by, after they had between them carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object, the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour Don Quixote, and effect their purpose; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) notion, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) explained to the barber, was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel, while the other should try as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could to pass for a squire, and that they should thus proceed to where Don Quixote was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), which as a valiant knight-errant he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not refuse to grant; and the favour he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) whither she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) would conduct him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), in order to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had done her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), while at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) should entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) not to require her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) to remove her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) mask, nor ask her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) any question touching her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) circumstances until he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had righted her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) with the wicked knight.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had no doubt that Don Quixote would comply with any request made in these terms, and that in this way they might remove him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own village, where they would endeavour to find out if his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) extraordinary madness admitted of any kind of remedy.
<p/>They left him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and went in, and presently the barber brought him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) out something to eat. CHAPTER XXVII. OF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME;
<p/>The curate's plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on the contrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in execution.
<p/>They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) in pledge a new cassock of the curate's; and the barber made a beard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to stick his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) comb.
<p/>The landlady asked them what they wanted these things for, and the curate told her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) in a few words about the madness of Don Quixote, and how this disguise was intended to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) away from the mountain where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) then was.
<p/>The landlord and landlady immediately came to the conclusion that the madman was their guest, the balsam man and master of the blanketed squire, and they told the curate all that had passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) and them, not omitting what Sancho had been so silent about.
<p/>Finally the landlady dressed up the curate in a style that left nothing to be desired; she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) put on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a cloth petticoat with black velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of green velvet set off by a binding of white satin, which as well as the petticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba.
<p/>The curate would not let them hood him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), but put on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) head a little quilted linen cap which he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) used for a night-cap, and bound his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) forehead with a strip of black silk, while with another he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) made a mask with which he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) beard and face very well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) then put on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hat, which was broad enough to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) for an umbrella, and enveloping himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mule, while the barber mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and white, for it was, as has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox.
<p/>They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) was, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had in hand.
<p/>But hardly had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sallied forth from the inn when it struck the curate that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) to change dresses, as it was fitter he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) should be the distressed damsel, while he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) himself would play the squire's part, which would be less derogatory to his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) dignity; otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) was resolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the devil take Don Quixote.
<p/>Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was unable to restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to instruct him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) how to play his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) part and what to say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to come with them and give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fancy for the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had chosen for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) idle penance.
<p/>The barber told him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) could manage it properly without any instruction, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) did not care to dress himself up until they were near where Don Quixote was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) folded up the garments, and the curate adjusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) beard, and they set out under the guidance of Sancho Panza, who went along telling them of the encounter with the madman they met in the Sierra, saying nothing, however, about the finding of the valise and its contents; for with all his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) simplicity the lad was a trifle covetous.
<p/>The next day they reached the place where Sancho had laid the broom-branches as marks to direct him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, and recognising it he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) told them that here was the entrance, and that they would do well to dress themselves, if that was required to deliver his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master; for they had already told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that going in this guise and dressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master from the pernicious life he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had adopted; and they charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) strictly not to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master who they were, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew them, and should he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ask, as ask he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had given the letter to Dulcinea, to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had, and that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not know how to read, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had given an answer by word of mouth, saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), on pain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) displeasure, to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) at once; and it was a very important matter for himself, because in this way and with what they meant to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) they felt sure of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) back to a better mode of life and inducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to take immediate steps to become an emperor or monarch, for there was no fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) becoming an archbishop.
<p/>All this Sancho listened to and fixed it well in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) memory, and thanked them heartily for intending to recommend his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master to be an emperor instead of an archbishop, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt sure that in the way of bestowing rewards on their squires emperors could do more than archbishops-errant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, too, that it would be as well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to go on before them to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lady's answer; for that perhaps might be enough to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) away from the place without putting them to all this trouble.
<p/>They approved of what Sancho proposed, and resolved to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) brought back word of having found his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master.
<p/>Sancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one through which there flowed a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocks and trees afforded a cool and grateful shade.
<p/>It was an August day with all the heat of one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and the hour was three in the afternoon, all which made the spot the more inviting and tempted them to wait there for Sancho's return, which they did.
<p/>They were reposing, then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompanied by the notes of any instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone, reached their ears, at which they were not a little astonished, as the place did not seem to them likely quarters for one who sang so well; for though it is often said that shepherds of rare voice are to be found in the woods and fields, this is rather a flight of the poet's fancy than the truth.
<p/>And still more surprised were they when they perceived that what they heard sung were the verses not of rustic shepherds, but of the polished wits of the city; and so it proved, for the verses they heard were these: What makes my quest of happiness seem vain?
<p/>TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORY Disdain. What bids me to abandon hope of ease? Jealousies.
<p/>What holds my heart in anguish of suspense? Absence. If that be so, then for my grief Where shall I turn to seek relief,
<p/>When hope on every side lies slain By Absence, Jealousies, Disdain? What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?
<p/>Love. What at my glory ever looks askance? Chance. Whence is permission to afflict me given? Heaven. If that be so,
<p/>I but await The stroke of a resistless fate, Since, working for my woe, these three, Love, Chance and Heaven, in league I see.
<p/>What must I do to find a remedy? Die. What is the lure for love when coy and strange? Change. What, if all fail, will cure the heart of sadness?
<p/>Madness. If that be so, it is but folly To seek a cure for melancholy: Ask where it lies; the answer saith
<p/>The hour, the summer season, the solitary place, the voice and skill of the singer, all contributed to the wonder and delight of the two listeners, who remained still waiting to hear something more; finding, however, that the silence continued some little time, they resolved to go in search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just as they were about to do so they were checked by the same voice, which once more fell upon their ears, singing this SONNET
<p/>When heavenward, holy Friendship, thou didst go Soaring to seek thy home beyond the sky, And take thy seat among the saints on high
<p/>, It was thy will to leave on earth below Thy semblance, and upon it to bestow Thy veil, wherewith at times hypocrisy, Parading in thy shape, deceives the eye, And makes its vileness bright as virtue show.
<p/>In Change, in Madness, or in Death. Friendship, return to us, or force the cheat That wears it now, thy livery to restore,
<p/>By aid whereof sincerity is slain. If thou wilt not unmask thy counterfeit, This earth will be the prey of strife once more,
<p/>The song ended with a deep sigh, and again the listeners remained waiting attentively for the singer to resume; but perceiving that the music had now turned to sobs and heart-rending moans they determined to find out who the unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) sighs were piteous, and they had not proceeded far when on turning the corner of a rock they discovered a man of the same aspect and appearance as Sancho had described to them when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) told them the story of Cardenio.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), showing no astonishment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw them, stood still with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head bent down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) breast like one in deep thought, without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes to look at them after the first glance when they suddenly came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>The curate, who was aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) misfortune and recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) by the description, being a man of good address, approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and in a few sensible words entreated and urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to quit a life of such misery, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should end it there, which would be the greatest of all misfortunes.
<p/>Cardenio was then in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) right mind, free from any attack of that madness which so frequently carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) away, and seeing them dressed in a fashion so unusual among the frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing some surprise, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heard them speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) case as if it were a well-known matter -LRB-for the curate's words gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to understand as much-RRB- so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) replied to them thus: <div class="bookquote">``I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose care it is to succour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in this remote spot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserve it not, those who seek to draw me away from this to some better retreat, showing me by many and forcible arguments
<p/>how unreasonably I act in leading the life I do; but as they know, that if I escape from this evil I shall fall into another still greater, perhaps they will set me down as a weak-minded man, or, what is worse, one devoid of reason; nor would it be any wonder, for I myself can perceive that the effect of the recollection of my misfortunes is so great and works so powerfully to my ruin, that in spite of myself I become at times like a stone, without feeling or consciousness; and I come to feel the truth of it when they tell me and show me proofs of the things I have done when the terrible fit overmasters me; and all I can do is bewail my lot in vain, and idly curse my destiny, and plead for my madness by telling how it was caused, to any that care to hear it; for no reasonable beings on learning the cause will wonder at the effects; and if they cannot help me at least they will not blame me, and the repugnance they feel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes.
<p/>As when primaeval discord held its reign. If it be, sirs, that you are here with the same design as others have come wah,
<p/>when you have heard it you will spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offering consolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own lips the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) suffering, they entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to tell it, promising not to do anything for his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) relief or comfort that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did not wish; and thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sad story in nearly the same words and manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had related it to Don Quixote and the goatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and Don Quixote's scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale was left unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but now fortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to tell it to the end; and so, coming to the incident of the note which Don Fernando had found in the volume of <div class="bookquote">``Amadis of Gaul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Fernando/Fernando/Senor Don Fernando</b></font>)</div>Cardenio said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) remembered it perfectly and that it was in these words: <div class="bookquote">``Luscinda to Cardenio.
<p/>Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold you in higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this obligation without cost to my honour, you may easily do so.
<p/>I have a father who knows you and loves me dearly, who without putting any constraint on my inclination will grant what will be reasonable for you to have, if it be that you value me as you say and
<p/>By this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for my wife, and it was through it that Luscinda came to be regarded by Don Fernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day, and this letter it was that suggested his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) design of ruining me before mine could be carried into effect.
<p/>I told Don Fernando that all Luscinda's father was waiting for was that mine should ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), which I did not dare to suggest to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), fearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not consent to do so; not because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know perfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue, and beauty of Luscinda, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) had qualities that would do honour to any family in Spain, but because I was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not wish me to marry so soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me.
<p/>In short, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ricardo</b></font>) I did not venture to mention it to my father, as well on account of that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged me though I knew not well what they were, only that it seemed to me that what I desired was never to come to pass.
<p/>To all this Don Fernando answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) would take it upon himself to speak to my father, and persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) to speak to Luscinda's father.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as I believe you do. '' '' O, ambitious Marius! O, cruel Catiline! O, wicked Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherous Vellido!
<p/>Traitor, cruel, vindictive, and perfidious, wherein had this poor wretch failed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) fidelity, who with such frankness showed thee the secrets and the joys of his (<font color='blue'><b>Traitor</b></font>) heart?
<p/>What words did I utter, or what counsels did I give that had not the furtherance of thy honour and welfare for their aim?
<p/>for sure it is that when misfortunes spring from the stars, descending from on high they fall upon us with such fury and violence that no power on earth can check their course nor human device
<p/>O, vindictive Julian! O, covetous Judas! What offence did I commit? But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain? stay their coming.
<p/>Who could have thought that Don Fernando, a highborn gentleman, intelligent, bound to me by gratitude for my services, one that could win the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) love wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) might set his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) affections, could have become so obdurate, as they say, as to rob me of my one ewe lamb that was not even yet in my possession?
<p/>To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the execution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) treacherous and wicked design, resolved to send me to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) to pay for six horses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending me away that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) might the better carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) infernal scheme, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had purchased the very day he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) offered to speak to my father, and the price of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) now desired me to fetch.
<p/>But laying aside these useless and unavailing reflections, let us take up the broken thread of my unhappy story. '' Could I have anticipated this treachery?
<p/>; so far from that, I offered with the greatest pleasure to go at once, in my satisfaction at the good bargain that had been made.
<p/>That night I spoke with Luscinda, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) what had been agreed upon with Don Fernando, and how I had strong hopes of our fair and reasonable wishes being realised.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), as unsuspicious as I was of the treachery of Don Fernando, bade me try to return speedily, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) believed the fulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my father put off speaking to hers.
<p/>I know not why it was that on saying this to me her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) eyes filled with tears, and there came a lump in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) throat that prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) from uttering a word of many more that it seemed to me she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was striving to say to me.
<p/>Could I by any chance have suspected it? Nay I was astonished at this unusual turn, which I never before observed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>).
<p/>for we always conversed, whenever good fortune and my ingenuity gave us the chance, with the greatest gaiety and cheerfulness, mingling tears, sighs, jealousies, doubts, or fears with our words; it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune that Heaven should have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) to me for my mistress; I glorified her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) beauty, I extolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) worth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) understanding; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) paid me back by praising in me what in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) love for me
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) thought worthy of praise; and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our neighbours and acquaintances to talk about, and the utmost extent of my boldness was to take, almost by force, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) fair white hands and carry it to my lips, as well as the closeness of the low grating that separated us allowed me.
<p/>But the night before the unhappy day of my departure she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) wept, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) moaned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) sighed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) withdrew leaving me filled with perplexity and amazement, overwhelmed at the sight of such strange and affecting signs of grief and sorrow in Luscinda; but not to dash my hopes I ascribed it all to the depth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) love for me and the pain that separation gives those who love tenderly.
<p/>At last I took my departure, sad and dejected, my heart filled with fancies and suspicions, but not knowing well what it was I suspected or fancied; plain omens pointing to the sad event and misfortune that was awaiting me.
<p/>I reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to Don Fernando's brother, and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days in some place where the duke his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) father was not likely to see me, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) brother wrote that the money was to be sent without his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) knowledge; all of which was a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) brother had no want of money to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) to despatch me at once.
<p/>The command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying it, as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days separated from Luscinda, especially after leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) in the sorrowful mood I have described to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant I obeyed, though I felt it would be at the cost of my well-being.
<p/>But four days later there came a man in quest of me with a letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me, and which by the address I perceived to be from Luscinda, as the writing was hers.
<p/>I opened it with fear and trepidation, persuaded that it must be something serious that had impelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) to write to me when at a distance, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) seldom did so when I was near.
<p/>Before reading it I asked the man who it was that had given it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and how long he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been upon the road; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me that as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happened to be passing through one of the streets of the city at the hour of noon, a very beautiful lady called to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from a window, and with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hurriedly, `Brother, if you are, as you seem to be, a Christian, for the love of God I entreat you to have this letter despatched without a moment's delay to the place and person named in the address, all which is well known, and by this you will render a great service to our Lord; and that you may be at no inconvenience in doing so take what is in this handkerchief;' and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), `with this she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) threw me a handkerchief out of the window in which were tied up a hundred reals and this gold ring which I bring here together with the letter I have given you.
<p/>And then without waiting for any answer she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left the window, though not before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw me take the letter and the handkerchief, and I had by signs let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) know that I would do as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bade me; and so, seeing myself so well paid for the trouble I would have in bringing it to you, and knowing by the address that it was to you
<p/>, I know you very well-RRB-, and also unable to resist that beautiful lady's tears, I resolved to trust no one else, but to come myself and give it to you, and in sixteen hours from the time when it was given me I have made the journey, which, as you know, is eighteen leagues.'
<p/>All the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this, I hung upon his (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) words, my legs trembling under me so that I could scarcely stand.
<p/>''`The promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) has fulfilled much more to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) own satisfaction than to your advantage.
<p/>I have to tell you, senor, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) has demanded me for a wife, and my father, led away by what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) considers Don Fernando's superiority over you, has favoured his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suit so cordially, that in two days hence the betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so privately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavens above and a few of the household.
<p/>'' '' it was sent -LRB-for, senor '' However, I opened the letter and read these words: Picture to yourself the state I am in
<p/>; judge if it be urgent for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you whether I love you or not.
<p/>God grant this may come to your hand before mine shall be forced to link itself with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who keeps so ill the faith that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has pledged.'
<p/>Such, in brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me set out at once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I now saw clearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own pleasure that had made Don Fernando send me to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) brother.
<p/>The exasperation I felt against Don Fernando, joined with the fear of losing the prize I had won by so many years of love and devotion, lent me wings; so that almost flying I reached home the same day, by the hour which served for speaking with Luscinda.
<p/>I arrived unobserved, and left the mule on which I had come at the house of the worthy man who had brought me the letter, and fortune was pleased to be for once so kind that I found Luscinda at the grating that was the witness of our loves.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) recognised me at once, and I her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), but not as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) ought to have recognised me, or I her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>).
<p/>But who is there in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable nature of a woman?
<p/>To proceed: as soon as Luscinda saw me she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) said, `Cardenio, I am in my bridal dress, and the treacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are waiting for me in the hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the witnesses of my death before they witness my betrothal.
<p/>Be not distressed, my friend, but contrive to be present at this sacrifice, and if that cannot be prevented by my words, I have a dagger concealed which will prevent more deliberate violence, putting an end to my life and giving thee a first proof of the love I have borne and bear thee.'
<p/>I replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) distractedly and hastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply, `May thy words be verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast a dagger to save thy honour, I have a sword to defend thee or kill myself if fortune be against us.'
<p/>I think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not have heard all these words, for I perceived that they called her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting.
<p/>Now the night of my sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt my eyes bereft of sight, my mind of reason.
<p/>I could not enter the house, nor was I capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it was that I should be present at what might take place on the occasion, I nerved myself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all the entrances and outlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secret pervaded the house no one took notice of me, so, without being seen, I found an opportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a window of the hall itself, and concealed by the ends and borders of two tapestries, from between which I could, without being seen, see all that took place in the room.
<p/>Who could describe the agitation of heart I suffered as I stood there--the thoughts that came to me--the reflections that passed through my mind?
<p/>Of a truth no one. '' They were such as cannot be, nor were it well they should be, told. Suffice it to say that the bridegroom entered the hall in his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) usual dress, without ornament of any kind
<p/>; as groomsman he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) had with him (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) a cousin of Luscinda's and except the servants of the house there was no one else in the chamber.
<p/>Soon afterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber, attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) mother and two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) damsels, arrayed and adorned as became her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) rank and beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire.
<p/>My anxiety and distraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) wore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson and white, and the glitter of the gems and jewels on her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) head dress and apparel, surpassed by the rare beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) lovely auburn hair that vying with the precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood in the hall shone with a brighter gleam than all.
<p/>Oh memory, mortal foe of my peace! why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adored enemy of mine?
<p/>Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and recall what she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may seek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid myself of life?
<p/>Be not weary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of those that can or should be told tersely and briefly, for to me each incident seems to call for many words.
<p/>To this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), but that the details he (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) mentioned interested them greatly, being of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the same attention as the main story.
<p/>To proceed, then,'' continued Cardenio: <div class="bookquote">``all being assembled in the hall, the priest of the parish came in and as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) took the pair by the hand to perform the requisite ceremony, at the words, `Will you, Senora Luscinda, take Senor Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful husband, as the holy Mother Church ordains?'
<p/>I thrust my head and neck out from between the tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing heart set myself to listen to Luscinda's answer, awaiting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) reply the sentence of death or the grant of life.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cardenio</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, that I had but dared at that moment to rush forward crying aloud, `Luscinda, Luscinda! have a care
<p/>; bethink thee thou art mine and canst not be another's; reflect that thy utterance of <div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the end of my life will come at the same instant.
<p/>what thou dost; remember what thou owest me O, treacherous Don Fernando! robber of my glory, death of my life! What seekest thou?
<p/>Remember that thou canst not as a Christian attain the object of thy wishes, for Luscinda is my bride, and I am her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) husband!'
<p/>now that I am far away, and out of danger, I say I should have done what I did not do: now that I have allowed my precious treasure to be robbed from me, I curse the robber, on whom I might have taken vengeance had I as much heart for it as I have for bewailing my fate; in short, as I was then a coward and a fool, little wonder is it if I am now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and mad.
<p/>The priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a long time withheld it; and just as I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was taking out the dagger to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of the truth on my behalf, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) say in a faint and feeble voice, 'I will:' Don Fernando said the same, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) the ring they stood linked by a knot that could never be loosed.
<p/>The bridegroom then approached to embrace his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) bride; and she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) heart, fell fainting in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mother's arms.
<p/>It only remains now for me to tell you the state I was in when in that consent that I heard I saw all my hopes mocked, the words and promises of Luscinda proved falsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I had that instant lost rendered impossible for ever.
<p/>I stood stupefied, wholly abandoned, it seemed, by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earth that bore me, the air refusing me breath for my sighs, the water moisture for my tears; it was only the fire that gathered strength so that my whole frame glowed with rage and jealousy.
<p/>Fool that I am! '' They were all thrown into confusion by Luscinda's fainting, and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) mother was unlacing her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) air
<p/>a sealed paper was discovered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) bosom which Don Fernando seized at once and began to read by the light of one of the torches.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had read it he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) seated himself in a chair, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) cheek on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) hand in the attitude of one deep in thought, without taking any part in the efforts that were being made to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) bride from her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) fainting fit.
<p/>Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out regardless whether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to do some frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous indignation of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don Fernando, and even in that of the fickle fainting traitress.
<p/>But my fate, doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows, if such there be, so ordered it that just then I had enough and to spare of that reason which has since been wanting to me; and so, without seeking to take vengeance on my greatest enemies -LRB-which might have been easily taken, as all thought of me was so far from their minds-RRB-, I resolved to take it upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain they deserved, perhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt out to them
<p/>had I then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over, but that which is protracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life.
<p/>In a word, I quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom I had left my mule; I made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saddle it for me, mounted without bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farewell, and rode out of the city, like another Lot, not daring to turn my head to look back upon it; and when I found myself alone in the open country, screened by the darkness of the night, and tempted by the stillness to give vent to my grief without apprehension or fear of being heard or seen, then I broke silence and lifted up my voice in maledictions upon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if I could thus avenge the wrong they had done me.
<p/>I called her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) cruel, ungrateful, false, thankless, but above all covetous, since the wealth of my enemy had blinded the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) affection, and turned it from me to transfer it to one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal.
<p/>And yet, in the midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding, I found excuses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the seclusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parents' house, trained and schooled to obey them always, should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they offered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for a husband a gentleman of such distinction, wealth, and noble birth, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had refused to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have been thought out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) senses, or to have set her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) affection elsewhere, a suspicion injurious to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fair name and fame.
<p/>, they would have seen that in choosing me she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), for before Don Fernando had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) offer, they themselves could not have desired, if their desires had been ruled by reason, a more eligible husband for their daughter than I was; and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), before taking the last fatal step of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand, might easily have said that I had already given her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mine, for I should have come forward to support any assertion of hers to that effect.
<p/>In short, I came to the conclusion that feeble love, little reflection, great ambition, and a craving for rank, had made her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) forget the words with which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had deceived me, encouraged and supported by my firm hopes and honourable passion.
<p/>Thus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed onward for the remainder of the night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of these mountains, among which I wandered for three days more without taking any path or road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not which side of the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in what direction the most rugged part of the range lay.
<p/>They told me that it was in this quarter, and I at once directed my course hither, intending to end my life here; but as I was making my way among these crags, my mule dropped dead through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think more likely, in order to have done with such a worthless burden as it bore in me.
<p/>I was left on foot, worn out, famishing, without anyone to help me or any thought of seeking help: and so thus I lay stretched on the ground,
<p/>how long I know not, after which I rose up free from hunger, and found beside me some goatherds, who no doubt were the persons who had relieved me in my need, for they told me how they had found me, and how I had been uttering ravings that showed plainly I had lost my reason; and since then I am conscious that I am not always in full possession of it, but at times so deranged and crazed that I do a thousand mad things, tearing my clothes, crying aloud in these solitudes, cursing my fate, and idly calling on the dear name of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) who is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life in lamentation; and when I recover my senses I find myself so exhausted and weary that I can scarcely move.
<p/>Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of a cork tree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen and goatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by compassion, furnish me with food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they think I may perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then out of my senses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain me, and make me crave it and eager to take it.
<p/>At other times, so they tell me when they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon the road, and though they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by force from the shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts.
<p/>Thus do pass the wretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven's will to bring it to a close, or so to order my memory that I no longer recollect the beauty and treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me by Don Fernando; for if it will do this without depriving me of life, I will turn my thoughts into some better channel; if not, I can only implore it to have full mercy on my soul, for in myself
<p/>I feel no power or strength to release my body from this strait in which I have of my own accord chosen to place it.
<p/>Such, sirs, is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one that can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do not trouble yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests as likely to serve for my relief, for it will avail me as much as the medicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will not take it.
<p/>I have no wish for health without Luscinda; and since it is her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) pleasure to be another's, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) is or should be mine, let it be mine to be a prey to misery when I might have enjoyed happiness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) fickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will strive to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) wishes by seeking destruction; and it will show generations to come that I alone was deprived of that of which all others in misfortune have a superabundance, for to them the impossibility of being consoled is itself a consolation, while to me it is the cause of greater sorrows and sufferings, for I think that even in death there will not be an end of them.
<p/>Here Cardenio brought to a close his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) long discourse and story, as full of misfortune as it was of love; but just as the curate was going to address some words of comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) was stopped by a voice that reached his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) ear, saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the Fourth Part of this narrative; for at this point the sage and sagacious historian, Cide Hamete Benengeli, brought the Third to a conclusion.
<p/>WHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE AND DELIGHTFUL ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL THE CURATE AND THE BARBER IN THE SAME SIERRA Happy and fortunate
<p/>were the times when that most daring knight Don Quixote of La Mancha was sent into the world; for by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) having formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive and restore to the world the long-lost and almost defunct order of knight-errantry, we now enjoy in this age of ours, so poor in light entertainment, not only the charm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) veracious history, but also of the tales and episodes contained in it which are, in a measure, no less pleasing, ingenious, and truthful, than the history itself; which, resuming its thread, carded, spun, and wound, relates that just as the curate was going to offer consolation to Cardenio, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was interrupted by a voice that fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ear saying in plaintive tones: <div class="bookquote">``O God! is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secret grave for the weary load of this body that I support so unwillingly?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But then again, I said, had she (<font color='blue'><b>curate</b></font>) declared I was her (<font color='blue'><b>curate</b></font>) husband '' '' '' CHAPTER XXVIII. If the solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah!
<p/>how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these rocks and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven, than that of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to for counsel in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!''
<p/>All this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>), and as it seemed to them to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got up to look for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces they discovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth in the dress of a peasant, whose face they were unable at the moment to see as he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was leaning forward, bathing his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) feet in the brook that flowed past.
<p/>They approached so silently that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) did not perceive them, being fully occupied in bathing his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) feet, which were so fair that they looked like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other stones of the brook.
<p/>The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them with surprise, for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods or to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner's dress suggested; and so, finding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was in front, made a sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock that lay there; which they did, observing closely what the youth was about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had on a loose double-skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) body with a white cloth; he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) wore besides breeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) head a brown montera; and he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had the gaiters turned up as far as the middle of the leg, which verily seemed to be of pure alabaster.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had done bathing his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) beautiful feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) wiped them with a towel he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) took from under the montera, on taking off which he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) face, and those who were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had an opportunity of seeing a beauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper: ``As this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being.
<p/>The youth then took off the montera, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) head from side to side there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of the sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a peasant was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of them had ever beheld, or even Cardenio's if they had not seen and known Luscinda, for he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscinda could compare with this.
<p/>The long auburn tresses not only covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) shoulders, but such was their length and abundance, concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) all round beneath their masses, so that except the feet nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) form was visible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) now used her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) hands as a comb, and if her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) feet had seemed like bits of crystal in the water, her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) hands looked like pieces of driven snow among her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) locks; all which increased not only the admiration of the three beholders, but their anxiety to learn who she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was.
<p/>With this object they resolved to show themselves, and at the stir they made in getting upon their feet the fair damsel raised her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) head, and parting her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) hair from before her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) eyes with both hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) looked to see who had made the noise, and the instant she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) perceived them
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) started to her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) feet, and without waiting to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) shoes or gather up her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as though of clothes that she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) had beside her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), and, scared and alarmed, endeavoured to take flight; but before she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) had gone six paces she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) fell to the ground, her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) delicate feet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeing which, the three hastened towards her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), and the curate addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) first said: ``Stay, senora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here only desire to be of service to you
<p/>; you have no need to attempt a flight so heedless, for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.
<p/>They, however, came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), and the curate taking her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) hand went on to say: ``What your dress would hide, senora, is made known to us by your hair; a clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your beauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like these where we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieve your distress, at least to offer you comfort; for no distress, so long as life lasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make the sufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention.
<p/>And so, senora, or senor, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss the fears that our appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with your good or evil fortunes, for from all of us together, or from each one of us, you will receive sympathy in your trouble.
<p/>While the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as if spell-bound, looking at them without opening her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) lips or uttering a word, just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has never seen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing some further words to the same effect to her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), sighing deeply she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) broke silence and said: <div class="bookquote">``Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me, and the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to deal in falsehoods, it would be idle for me now to make any further pretence of what, if you were to believe me, you would believe more out of courtesy than for any other reason.
<p/>woe is me! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Taken by surprise and bewildered, she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) made no reply to these words. '' This being so
<p/>, I say I thank you, sirs, for the offer you have made me, which places me under the obligation of complying with the request you have made of me; though I fear the account I shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in you as much concern as compassion, for you will be unable to suggest anything to remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them.
<p/>However, that my honour may not be left a matter of doubt in your minds, now that you have discovered me to be a woman, and see that I am young, alone, and in this dress, things that taken together or separately would be enough to destroy any good name, I feel bound to tell what I would willingly keep secret if I could.
<p/>All this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without any hesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were not less charmed by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) intelligence than by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty, and as they again repeated their offers and entreaties to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to fulfil her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promise,
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) without further pressing, first modestly covering her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet and gathering up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair, seated herself on a stone with the three placed around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and, after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, in a clear and steady voice began her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) story thus: <div class="bookquote">``In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title which makes him (<font color='blue'><b>duke</b></font>) one of those that are called Grandees of Spain.
<p/>This nobleman has two sons, the elder heir to his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) dignity and apparently to his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) good qualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be the treachery of Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon.
<p/>My parents are this lord's vassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had conferred as much on them as fortune, they would have had nothing left to desire, nor should I have had reason to fear trouble like that in which I find myself now; for it may be that my ill fortune came of theirs in not having been nobly born.
<p/>It is true they are not so low that they have any reason to be ashamed of their condition, but neither are they so high as to remove from my mind the impression that my mishap comes of their humble birth.
<p/>They are, in short, peasants, plain homely people, without any taint of disreputable blood, and, as the saying is, old rusty Christians, but so rich that by their wealth and free-handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be considered gentlefolk by birth, and even by position; though the wealth and nobility they thought most of was having me for their daughter; and as they have no other child to make their heir, and are affectionate parents, I was one of the most indulged daughters that ever parents indulged.
<p/>I was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of their old age, and the object in which, with submission to Heaven, all their wishes centred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knew their worth; and as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also of their possessions.
<p/>Through me they engaged or dismissed their servants; through my hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and reaped; the oil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks and herds, the beehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my father has or can have, I had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistress with an assiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannot well describe to you.
<p/>The leisure hours left to me after I had given the requisite orders to the head-shepherds, overseers, and other labourers, I passed in such employments as are not only allowable but necessary for young girls, those that the needle, embroidery cushion, and spinning wheel usually afford, and if to refresh my mind I quitted them for a while
<p/>, I found recreation in reading some devotional book or playing the harp, for experience taught me that music soothes the troubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit.
<p/>and if I have depicted it thus minutely, it is not out of ostentation, or to let you know that I am rich, but that you may see how, without any fault of mine, I have fallen from the happy condition I have described, to the misery I am in at present.
<p/>The truth is, that while I was leading this busy life, in a retirement that might compare with that of a monastery, and unseen as I thought by any except the servants of the house -LRB-for when I went to Mass it was so early in the morning, and I was so closely attended by my mother and the women of the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that my eyes scarcely saw more ground than I trod on-RRB-, in spite of all this, the eyes of love, or idleness, more properly speaking, that the lynx's cannot rival, discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of Don Fernando; for that is the name of the younger son of the duke I told of.
<p/>The moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio changed colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion that the curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the mad fits which they heard attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) sometimes was coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>); but Cardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding the peasant girl with fixed attention, for he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) began to suspect who she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' Such was the life I led in my parents' house '' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), however, without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) story, went on to say:
<p/>``And they had hardly discovered me, when, as he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) owned afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was smitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which it displayed itself plainly showed.
<p/>But to shorten the long recital of my woes, I will pass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don Fernando for declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) passion for me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) bribed all the household, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) gave and offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was like a holiday or a merry-making in our street; by night no one could sleep for the music; the love letters that used to come to my hand, no one knew how, were innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges, containing more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all which not only did not soften me, but hardened my heart against him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had been my mortal enemy, and as if everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) did to make me yield were done with the opposite intention.
<p/>Not that the high-bred bearing of Don Fernando was disagreeable to me, or that I found his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) importunities wearisome; for it gave me a certain sort of satisfaction to find myself so sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction, and I was not displeased at seeing my praises in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) letters -LRB-for however ugly we women may be, it seems to me it always pleases us to hear ourselves called beautiful-RRB- but that my own sense of right was opposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice of my parents, who now very plainly perceived Don Fernando's purpose, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) cared very little if all the world knew it.
<p/>They told me they trusted and confided their honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and bade me consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from which I might conclude that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) intentions, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) might say to the contrary, had for their aim his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) own pleasure rather than my advantage; and if I were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) unreasonable suit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once to anyone I preferred, either among the leading people of our own town, or of any of those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my good name, a match might be looked for in any quarter.
<p/>This offer, and their sound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando a word in reply that could hold out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) any hope of success, however remote.
<p/>All this caution of mine, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) must have taken for coyness, had apparently the effect of increasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) wanton appetite--for that is the name I give to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) passion for me; had it been what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) declared it to be, you would not know of it now, because there would have been no occasion to tell you of it.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) learned that my parents were contemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) hopes of obtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors to watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) act as you shall hear.
<p/>One night, as I was in my chamber with no other companion than a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully locked lest my honour should be imperilled through any carelessness, I know not nor can conceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusion and these precautions, and in the solitude and silence of my retirement, I found him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) standing before me, a vision that so astounded me that it deprived my eyes of sight, and my tongue of speech.
<p/>I had no power to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) give me time to utter one, as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) immediately approached me, and taking me in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) arms -LRB-for, overwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help myself-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) began to make such professions to me that I know not how falsehood could have had the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and the traitor contrived that his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) tears should vouch for his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) words, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) sighs for his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) sincerity.
<p/>I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases such as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying protestations true, though without being moved by his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) sighs and tears to anything more than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of bewilderment passed away, and I began in some degree to recover myself, I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) with more courage than I thought I could have possessed, `If, as I am now in your arms, senor, I were in the claws of a fierce lion, and my deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything to the prejudice of my honour, it would no more be in my power to do it or say it, than it would be possible
<p/>that what was should not have been; so then, if you hold my body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul secured by virtuous intentions, very different from yours, as you will see if you attempt to carry them into effect by force.
<p/>I am your vassal, but I am not your slave; your nobility neither has nor should have any right to dishonour or degrade my humble birth; and low-born peasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much as you, a lord and gentleman:
<p/>with me your violence will be to no purpose, your wealth will have no weight, your words will have no power to deceive me, nor your sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the things I speak of in him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) whom my parents gave me as a husband, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will should be mine, and mine should be bounded by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and my honour being preserved even though my inclinations were not would willingly yield him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) what you, senor, would now obtain by force; and this I say lest you should suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything of me.'
<p/>If that,' said this disloyal gentleman, `be the only scruple you feel, fairest Dorothea' -LRB-for that is the name of this unhappy being-RRB-, `see here I give you my hand to be yours, and let Heaven, from which nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have here, be witnesses of this pledge.'
<p/>When Cardenio heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) say she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was called Dorothea, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) showed fresh agitation and felt convinced of the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) former suspicion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end of what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) already all but knew, so he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) merely said: <div class="bookquote">``What! is Dorothea your name, senora?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' ' '' I have heard of another of the same name who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed; by-and-by I may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your compassion.
<p/>Dorothea was struck by Cardenio's words as well as by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) strange and miserable attire, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew anything concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to tell it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at once, for if fortune had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) any blessing it was courage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt sure that none could reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) capable of increasing in any degree what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) endured already.
<p/>I would not let the occasion pass, senora,'' replied Cardenio, <div class="bookquote">``of telling you what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far there has been no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to know it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cardenio</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be it as it may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div>replied Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``what happened in my story was that Don Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it as a witness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words and extravagant oaths gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) promise to become my husband; though before he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had made an end of pledging himself
<p/>I bade him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) consider well what he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was doing, and think of the anger his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) father would feel at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) married to a peasant girl and one of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) vassals; I told him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) not to let my beauty, such as it was, blind him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), for that was not enough to furnish an excuse for his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) transgression; and if in the love he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) bore me he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wished to do me any kindness, it would be to leave my lot to follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriages so unequal never brought happiness, nor did they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began with.
<p/>I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), and much more which I cannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) to forego his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) purpose; he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself about difficulties when he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) is striking the bargain.
<p/>At the same time I argued the matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, 'I shall not be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station, nor will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more likely, a blind attachment, has led to mate himself below his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) rank.
<p/>Then, since I am introducing no new usage or practice, I may as well avail myself of the honour that chance offers me, for even though his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) inclination for me should not outlast the attainment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) wishes
<p/>And if I strive to repel him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) by scorn, I can see that, fair means failing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) is in a mood to use force, and I shall be left dishonoured and without any means of proving my innocence to those who cannot know how innocently I have come to be in this position; for what arguments would persuade my parents that this gentleman entered my chamber without my consent?'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div>'' '' All this that I have now repeated , I shall be, after all, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife before God. ''
<p/>All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment; but the oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) appealed to, the tears he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) shed, and lastly the charms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) person and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) high-bred grace, which, accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have conquered a heart even more free and coy than mine--these were the things that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to my ruin.
<p/>I called my waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness on earth besides those in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) oaths, invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to the former ones, called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter should he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) fail to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) promise, shed more tears, redoubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) sighs and pressed me closer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) arms, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had never allowed me to escape; and so I was left by my maid, and ceased to be one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) became a traitor and a perjured man.
<p/>The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so quickly, I imagine, as Don Fernando wished, for when desire has attained its object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure.
<p/>I say so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me, and by the adroitness of my maid, who was indeed the one who had admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), gained the street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) told me, though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) came, that I might rest assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) oaths; and to confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) words he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) drew a rich ring off his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) finger and placed it upon mine.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) then took his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) departure and I was left, I know not whether sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I was left agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place, and I had not the spirit, or else it did not occur to me, to chide my maid for the treachery she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had been guilty of in concealing Don Fernando in my chamber; for as yet I was unable to make up my mind whether what had befallen me was for good or evil.
<p/>I told Don Fernando at parting, that as I was now his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) might see me on other nights in the same way, until it should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) pleasure to let the matter become known; but, except the following night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) came no more, nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) in the street or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one; although I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was in the town, and almost every day went out hunting, a pastime he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was very fond of.
<p/>; I remember well how I began to doubt as they went by, and even to lose confidence in the faith of Don Fernando; and I remember, too, how my maid heard those words in reproof of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) audacity that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had not heard before, and how I was forced to put a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my countenance, not to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so melancholy, and drive me to invent falsehoods in reply.
<p/>But all this was suddenly brought to an end, for the time came when all such considerations were disregarded, and there was no further question of honour, when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad.
<p/>The reason was, that a few days later it was reported in the town that Don Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rare beauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position, though not so rich that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) portion would entitle her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to look for so brilliant a match; it was said, too, that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) name was Luscinda, and that at the betrothal some strange things had happened.
<p/>Cardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) only shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) shoulders, bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) lips, bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) brows, and before long two streams of tears escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) story, but went on in these words: <div class="bookquote">``This sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struck with a chill, with such wrath and fury
<p/>did my heart burn that I scarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying aloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was the victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a resolution I formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to assume this dress, which I got from a servant of my father's, one of the zagals, as they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the whole of my misfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the city where I heard my enemy was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remonstrated with me for my boldness, and condemned my resolution, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw me bent upon my purpose, offered to bear me company, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, to the end of the world.
<p/>I at once packed up in a linen pillow-case a woman's dress, and some jewels and money to provide for emergencies, and in the silence of the night, without letting my treacherous maid know, I sallied forth from the house, accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties, and on foot set out for the city, but borne as it were on wings by my eagerness to reach it, if not to prevent what I presumed to be already done, at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with what conscience he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had done it.
<p/>I reached my destination in two days and a half, and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda's parents.
<p/>The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I sought to know; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred at the betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of such notoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) said that on the night of Don Fernando's betrothal with Luscinda, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) had consented to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) bride by saying `Yes,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroom approaching to unlace the bosom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) dress to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) air, he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) found a paper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) own handwriting, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) said and declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) could not be Don Fernando's bride, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was already Cardenio's, who, according to the man's account, was a gentleman of distinction of the same city; and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) had accepted Don Fernando, it was only in obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) parents.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div>I remember well how sad and dreary those days and hours were to me '' In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) said, the words of the paper made it clear
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) meant to kill herself on the completion of the betrothal, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) reasons for putting an end to herself all which was confirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) clothes.
<p/>On seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had befooled, slighted, and trifled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), assailed her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) had recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) swoon, and tried to stab her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) with the dagger that had been found, and would have succeeded had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) parents and those who were present prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>).
<p/>It was said, moreover, that Don Fernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did not recover from her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) prostration until the next day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) parents how she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was really the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned.
<p/>I learned besides that Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the betrothal; and that upon seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) betrothed contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) expectation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had quitted the city in despair, leaving behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) a letter declaring the wrong Luscinda had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) intention of going where no one should ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) again.
<p/>All this was a matter of notoriety in the city, and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that Luscinda was missing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) father's house and from the city, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was not to be found anywhere, to the distraction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) parents, who knew not what steps to take to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>).
<p/>What I learned revived my hopes, and I was better pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) married, for it seemed to me that the door was not yet entirely shut upon relief in my case, and I thought that perhaps Heaven had put this impediment in the way of the second marriage, to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) to recognise his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) obligations under the former one, and reflect that as a Christian he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was bound to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) soul above all human objects.
<p/>All this passed through my mind, and I strove to comfort myself without comfort, indulging in faint and distant hopes of cherishing that life that I now abhor.
<p/>But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not find Don Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a great reward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of my age and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who came with me had taken me away from my father's house; a thing that cut me to the heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it was not enough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with whom I had fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my consideration.
<p/>The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with my servant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) fidelity to me, and the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most thickly wooded part of these mountains.
<p/>But, as is commonly said, one evil calls up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the beginning of one still greater, and so it proved in my case; for my worthy servant, until then so faithful and trusty when he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) found me in this lonely spot, moved more by his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own villainy than by my beauty, sought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes seemed to present him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), and with little shame and less fear of God and respect for me, began to make overtures to me; and finding that I replied to the effrontery of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) proposals with justly severe language, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) laid aside the entreaties which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had employed at first, and began to use violence.
<p/>But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good intentions, so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little exertion I pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) over a precipice, where I left him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), whether dead or alive I know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible in my terror and fatigue
<p/>, I made my way into the mountains, without any other thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and escaping my father and those despatched in search of me by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) orders.
<p/>It is now I know not how many months since with this object I came here, where I met a herdsman who engaged me as his (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>) servant at a place in the heart of this Sierra, and all this time I have been serving him (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>) as herd, striving to keep always afield to hide these locks which have now unexpectedly betrayed me.
<p/>But all my care and pains were unavailing, for my master made the discovery that I was not a man, and harboured the same base designs as my servant; and as fortune does not always supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, and I had no precipice or ravine at hand down which to fling the master and cure his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) passion, as I had in the servant's case, I thought it a lesser evil to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) and again conceal myself among these crags, than make trial of my strength and argument with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>So, as I say, once more I went into hiding to seek for some place where I might with sighs and tears implore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant me help and strength to escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leaving no trace of an unhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnished matter for talk and scandal at home and abroad.

<p/>UPON HIMSELF <div class="bookquote">``Such, sirs, is the true story of my sad adventures; judge for yourselves now whether the sighs and lamentations you heard, and the tears that flowed from my eyes, had not sufficient cause even if I had indulged in them more freely; and if you consider the nature of my misfortune you will see that consolation is idle, as there is no possible remedy for it.
<p/>All I ask of you is, what you may easily and reasonably do, to show me where I may pass my life unharassed by the fear and dread of discovery by those who are in search of me; for though the great love my parents bear me makes me feel sure of being kindly received by them, so great is my feeling of shame at the mere thought that I cannot present myself before them as they expect, that I had rather banish myself from their sight for ever than look them in the face with the reflection that they beheld mine stripped of that purity
<p/>With these words she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) became silent, and the colour that overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) face showed plainly the pain and shame she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was suffering at heart.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the whole story of my misfortunes. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am that unhappy being, senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cardenio</b></font>)</div>replied Cardenio, <div class="bookquote">``whom, as you have said, Luscinda declared to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) who has brought you to your present condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to me.
<p/>I, Dorothea, am he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando, and waited to hear the `Yes' uttered by which Luscinda owned herself
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) betrothed: I am he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) who had not courage enough to see how her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) fainting fit ended, or what came of the paper that was found in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) bosom, because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokes of ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience I quitted the house, and leaving a letter with my host, which I entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) to place in Luscinda's hands, I betook myself to these solitudes, resolved to end here the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy.
<p/>But fate would not rid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me of my reason, perhaps to preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting you; for if that which you have just told us be true, as I believe it to be, it may be that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination to our misfortunes than we look for; because seeing that Luscinda cannot marry Don Fernando, being mine, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) has herself so openly declared, and that Don Fernando cannot marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) is yours, we may reasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours, as it is still in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed.
<p/>And as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I entreat you, senora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I mean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don Fernando, and if I cannot by words induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) to recognise his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) obligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on account of the injury he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has done you, not regarding my own wrongs, which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself to yours.
<p/>Cardenio's words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) attempted to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised, and urged them to come with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) village, where they might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) parents, or do what seemed to them most advisable.
<p/>Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), and accepted the kind offer he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) made them; and the barber, who had been listening to all attentively and in silence, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) part some kindly words also, and with no less good-will than the curate offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) services in any way that might be of use to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) also explained to them in a few words the object that had brought them there, and the strange nature of Don Quixote's madness, and how they were waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire, who had gone in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Like the recollection of a dream, the quarrel he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had had with Don Quixote came back to Cardenio's memory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) described it to the others; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was unable to say what the dispute was about.
<p/>At this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from Sancho Panza, who, not finding them where he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) had left them, was calling aloud to them.
<p/>They went to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), and in answer to their inquiries about Don Quixote, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) told them how he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had found him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stripped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shirt, lank, yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea; and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to quit that place and come to El Toboso, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was determined not to appear in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) beauty until he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had done deeds to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) favour; and if this went on, Sancho said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as in duty bound, or even an archbishop, which was the least he (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) could be; for which reason they ought to consider what was to be done to get him (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) away from there.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cardenio</b></font>)</div>The licentiate in reply told him (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) not to be uneasy, for they would fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) away in spite of himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) then told Cardenio and Dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure Don Quixote, or at any rate take him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) home; upon which Dorothea said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could play the distressed damsel better than the barber; especially as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had there the dress in which to do it to the life, and that they might trust to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying out their scheme, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had read a great many books of chivalry, and knew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of knights-errant.
<p/>In that case,'' said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing more required than to set about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself in our favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for your relief, and smoothed the way for us to our object.
<p/>Dorothea then took out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pillow-case a complete petticoat of some rich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and a necklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) so arrayed herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked like a great and rich lady.
<p/>All this, and more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had taken from home in case of need, but that until then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had had no occasion to make use of it.
<p/>They were all highly delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) grace, air, and beauty, and declared Don Fernando to be a man of very little taste when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) rejected such charms.
<p/>But the one who admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) most was Sancho Panza, for it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) -LRB-what indeed was true-RRB- that in all the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) had never seen such a lovely creature; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) asked the curate with great eagerness who this beautiful lady was, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wanted in these out-of-the-way quarters.
<p/>This fair lady, brother Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate way</b></font>)</div>replied the curate, <div class="bookquote">``is no less a personage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom of Micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), which is that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>); and from the fame as a good knight which your master has acquired far and wide, this princess has come from Guinea to seek him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>A lucky seeking and a lucky finding!''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said Sancho Panza at this; ``especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury, and right that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your worship speaks of;
<p/>as kill him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) meets him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), unless, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) happens to be a phantom; for my master has no power at all against phantoms.
<p/>But one thing among others I would beg of you, senor licentiate, which is, that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an archbishop, for that is what I'm afraid of, your worship would recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) to marry this princess at once; for in this way he (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) will be disabled from taking archbishop's orders, and will easily come into his (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) empire, and I to the end of my desires; I have been thinking over the matter carefully, and by what I can make out
<p/>I find it will not do for me that my master should become an archbishop, because I am no good for the Church, as I am married; and for me now, having as I have a wife and children, to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me to hold a place of profit under the Church, would be endless work; so that, senor, it all turns on my master marrying this lady at once--for as yet I do not know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grace, and so I cannot call her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is called the Princess Micomicona,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate; <div class="bookquote">``for as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name.
<p/>There's no doubt of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for I have known many to take their name and title from the place where they were born and call themselves Pedro of Alcala, Juan of Ubeda, and Diego of Valladolid; and it may be that over there in Guinea queens have the same way of taking the names of their kingdoms.
<p/>So it may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said the curate; <div class="bookquote">``and as for your master's marrying, I will do all in my power towards it:''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>with which Sancho was as much pleased as the curate was amazed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) simplicity and at seeing what a hold the absurdities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master had taken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had evidently persuaded himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was going to be an emperor.
<p/>By this time Dorothea had seated herself upon the curate's mule, and the barber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) face, and they now told Sancho to conduct them to where Don Quixote was, warning him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) not to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knew either the licentiate or the barber, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master's becoming an emperor entirely depended on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) not recognising them; neither the curate nor Cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them
<p/>; Cardenio lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should remind Don Quixote of the quarrel he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and the curate as there was no necessity for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) presence just yet, so they allowed the others to go on before them, while they themselves followed slowly on foot.
<p/>The curate did not forget to instruct Dorothea how to act, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said they might make their minds easy, as everything would be done exactly as the books of chivalry required and described.
<p/>They had gone about three-quarters of a league when they discovered Don Quixote in a wilderness of rocks, by this time clothed, but without his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour; and as soon as Dorothea saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and was told by Sancho that that was Don Quixote, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) whipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) palfrey, the well-bearded barber following her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and on coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) squire sprang from his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) mule and came forward to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) arms, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dismounting with great ease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of Don Quixote; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) strove to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) up,
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) without rising addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in this fashion: <div class="bookquote">``From this spot I will not rise, valiant and doughty knight, until your goodness and courtesy grant me a boon, which will redound to the honour and renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolate and afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and if the might of your strong arm corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame, you are bound to aid the helpless being who, led by the savour of your renowned name, hath come from far distant lands to seek your aid in her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) misfortunes.

 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not rise, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>answered the afflicted damsel, <div class="bookquote">``unless of your courtesy the boon I ask is first granted me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I grant and accord it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``provided without detriment or prejudice to my king, my country, or her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) who holds the key of my heart and freedom, it may be complied with.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthy lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>said the afflicted damsel; and here Sancho Panza drew close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master's ear and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) very softly, <div class="bookquote">``Your worship may very safely grant the boon she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) asks; it's nothing at all; only to kill a big giant; and she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) who asks it is the exalted Princess Micomicona, queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon of Ethiopia.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) be who she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I will do what is my bounden duty, and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what I have professed;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and turning to the damsel he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Let your great beauty rise, for I grant the boon which you would ask of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Then what I ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>said the damsel, <div class="bookquote">``is that your magnanimous person accompany me at once whither
<p/>I will conduct you, and that you promise not to engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged me of a traitor who against all human and divine law, has usurped my kingdom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I repeat that I grant it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``and so, lady, you may from this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you, and let your failing hopes gather new life and strength, for with the help of God and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your kingdom, and seated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm, notwithstanding and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now hands to the work, for in delay there is apt to be danger.
<p/>The distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands; but Don Quixote, who was in all things a polished and courteous knight, would by no means allow it, but made her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) rise and embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) with great courtesy and politeness, and ordered Sancho to look to Rocinante's girths, and to arm him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) without a moment's delay.
<p/>Sancho took down the armour, which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, and having seen to the girths armed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master in a trice, who as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) armour exclaimed:
<p/>The barber was all this time on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees at great pains to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) laughter and not let his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beard fall, for

<p/>maybe their fine scheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted, and the promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared to set out in compliance with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rose and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady's hand, and between them they placed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) upon the mule.
<p/>Don Quixote then mounted Rocinante, and the barber settled himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) beast, Sancho being left to go on foot, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) feel anew the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Dapple, finding the want of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) now.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master had now fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an emperor; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt no doubt at all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would marry this princess, and be king of Micomicon at least.
<p/>The only thing that troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was the reflection that this kingdom was in the land of the blacks, and that the people they would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) for vassals would be all black; but for this he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) soon found a remedy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancy, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to himself, ``What is it to me if my vassals are blacks?
<p/>What more have I to do than make a cargo of them and carry them to Spain, where I can sell them and get ready money for them, and with it buy some title or some office in which to live at ease all the days of my life?
<p/>Not unless you go to sleep and haven't the wit or skill to turn things to account and sell three, six, or ten thousand vassals while you would be talking about it!
<p/>By God I will stir them up, big and little, or as best I can, and let them be ever so black I'll turn them into white or yellow.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) jogged on, so occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thoughts and easy in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forgot all about the hardship of travelling on foot.
<p/>Cardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes, not knowing how to join company with the others; but the curate, who was very fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting their purpose, and with a pair of scissors he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had in a case he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) quickly cut off Cardenio's beard, and putting on him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a grey jerkin of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a black cloak, leaving himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breeches and doublet, while Cardenio's appearance was so different from what it had been that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would not have known himself had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seen himself in a mirror.
<p/>Having effected this, although the others had gone on ahead while they were disguising themselves, they easily came out on the high road before them, for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did not allow those on horseback to go as fast as those on foot.
<p/>They then posted themselves on the level ground at the outlet of the Sierra, and as soon as Don Quixote and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) companions emerged from it the curate began to examine him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) very deliberately, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) were striving to recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and after having stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hastened towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with open arms exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``A happy meeting with the mirror of chivalry, my worthy compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flower and cream of high breeding, the protection and relief of the distressed, the quintessence of knights-errant!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Come, come, what a fool I am! '' And so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) clasped in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) arms the knee of Don Quixote's left leg.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), astonished at the stranger's words and behaviour, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) attentively, and at length recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), very much surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) there, and made great efforts to dismount.
<p/>This, however, the curate would not allow, on which Don Quixote said, <div class="bookquote">``Permit me, senor licentiate, for it is not fitting that I should be on horseback and so reverend a person as your worship on foot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On no account will I allow it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate; <div class="bookquote">``your mightiness must remain on horseback, for it is on horseback
<p/>you achieve the greatest deeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an unworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches of one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, if they have no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steed Pegasus, or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor, Muzaraque, who to this day lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema, a little distance from the great Complutum.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>Nor even that will I consent to, senor licentiate,'' answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and I know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the princess, out of love for me, to order her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) squire to give up the saddle of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) mule to your worship, and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) can sit behind if the beast will bear it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>It will, I am sure,'' said the princess, ``and I am sure, too, that I need not order my squire, for he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) is too courteous and considerate to allow a Churchman to go on foot when he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchman</b></font>) might be mounted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchman</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber, and at once alighting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchman</b></font>) offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchman</b></font>) saddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; but unfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it happened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying ill-conditioned, lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in the air, which would have made Master Nicholas wish his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) expedition in quest of Don Quixote at the devil
<p/>As it was, they so took him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) by surprise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) came to the ground, giving so little heed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) beard that it fell off, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could do when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found himself without it was to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face hastily with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hands and moan that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) teeth were knocked out.
<p/>Don Quixote when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or blood, from the face of the fallen squire, exclaimed:

 (<font color='red'><b>The curate</b></font>)</div><p/>The curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) scheme, at once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where Master Nicholas lay, still uttering moans, and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) head to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) breast had it on in an instant, muttering over him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) some words which he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) said were a certain special charm for sticking on beards, as they would see; and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) had it fixed he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>), and the squire appeared well bearded and whole as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure astonished, and begged the curate to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that charm when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had an opportunity, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was persuaded its virtue must extend beyond the sticking on of beards, for it was clear that where the beard had been stripped off the flesh must have remained torn and lacerated, and when it could heal all that it must be good for more than beards.
<p/>They then agreed that for the present the curate should mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they reached the inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.
<p/>Three then being mounted, that is to say, Don Quixote, the princess, and the curate, and three on foot, Cardenio, the barber, and Sancho Panza, Don Quixote said to the damsel: <div class="bookquote">``Let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to you;''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>but before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could answer the licentiate said: <div class="bookquote">``Towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course?

<p/>It must be, or else I know little about kingdoms.

<p/>In that case,'' said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``we must pass right through my village, and there your worship will take the road to Cartagena, where you will be able to embark, fortune favouring; and if the wind be fair and the sea smooth and tranquil, in somewhat less than nine years you may come in sight of the great lake Meona, I mean Meotides, which is little more than a hundred days' journey this side of your highness's kingdom.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Enough; no more praise,'' said Don Quixote at this, <div class="bookquote">``for I hate all flattery; and though this may not be so, still language of the kind is offensive to my chaste ears.
<p/>I will only say, senora, that whether it has might or not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to your service even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season, I would ask the senor licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) into these parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I am filled with amazement.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will answer that briefly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>replied the curate; <div class="bookquote">``you must know then, Senor Don Quixote, that Master Nicholas, our friend and barber, and I were going to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who went to the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum but that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, which is something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by four footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they stripped off so that the barber found it necessary to put on a false one, and even this young man here'' (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>-pointing to Cardenio--<div class="bookquote">``they completely transformed.
<p/>But the best of it is, the story goes in the neighbourhood that those who attacked us belong to a number of galley slaves who, they say, were set free almost on the very same spot by a man of such valour that, in spite of the commissary and of the guards, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) released the whole of them; and beyond all doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have been out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses, or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be as great a scoundrel as they, or some man without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep, the fox among the hens, the fly among the honey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) has defrauded justice, and opposed his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) king and lawful master, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) opposed his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) just commands; he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) has, I say, robbed the galleys of their feet, stirred up the Holy Brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet, and, lastly, has done a deed by which his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) soul may be lost without any gain to his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) body.
<p/>Sancho had told the curate and the barber of the adventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) glory, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master had achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most of it to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; who changed colour at every word, not daring to say that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who had been the liberator of those worthy people.
<p/>These, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cardenio</b></font>)</div>said the curate, ``were they who robbed us; and God in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercy pardon him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who would not let them go to the punishment they deserved.

<p/>I encountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people, and did for them what my sense of duty demands of me, and

<p/>Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly understood Don Quixote's crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza were making game of him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), not to be behind the rest said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), on observing his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) irritation, <div class="bookquote">``Sir Knight, remember the boon you have promised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that unconquered arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) would have stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) mouth thrice over, or even bitten his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) tongue three times before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) would have said a word that tended towards disrespect of your worship.''

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) side, eager to hear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for herself; and Sancho did the same, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was as much taken in by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think, began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I think from this on I shall have no need of any prompting, and I shall bring my true story safe into port, and here it is.
<p/>The king my father, who was called Tinacrio the Sapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became aware by his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was to die before he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) did, and that soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) too was to depart this life, and I was to be left an orphan without father or mother.
<p/>But all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) declared, did not so much grieve or distress him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) certain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island close to our kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name--for it is averred that, though his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes are properly placed and straight, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always looks askew as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) squinted, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does out of malignity, to strike fear and terror into those he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks at--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my orphan condition would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, not leaving me even a small village to shelter me; but
<p/>that I could avoid all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); however, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could see, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never expected that I would consent to a marriage so unequal; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said no more than the truth in this, for it has never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) be ever so great or enormous.
<p/>My father said, too, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was dead, and I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait and attempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, but that I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if I wished to avoid the death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for there would be no possibility of defending myself against the giant's devilish power; and that I should at once with some of my followers set out for Spain, where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a certain knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the whole kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don Azote or Don Gigote.''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>''`Don Quixote,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must have said, senora,'' observed Sancho at this, <div class="bookquote">``otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That is it,'' said Dorothea; ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) said, moreover, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) would be tall of stature and lank featured; and that on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) right side under the left shoulder, or thereabouts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) would have a grey mole with hairs like bristles.
<p/>On hearing this, Don Quixote said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire, <div class="bookquote">``Here, Sancho my son, bear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knight that sage king foretold.''
 (<font color='red'><b>squire</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``What does your worship want to strip for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. '' To see if I have that mole your father spoke of,'' answered Don Quixote.
<p/>There is no occasion to strip,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for I know your worship has just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark of a strong man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That is enough,'' said Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``for with friends we must not look too closely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where it may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the truth in every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending myself to Don Quixote; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is the one my father spoke of, as the features of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) countenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide fame he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has acquired not only in Spain but in all La Mancha
<p/>; for I had scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Osuna</b></font>) achievements, that at once my heart told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Osuna</b></font>) was the very one I had come in search of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div><p/>But before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``The princess meant to say that after she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had landed at Malaga the first place where she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) heard of your worship was Osuna.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' '' But how did you land at Osuna, senora,'' asked Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``when it is not a seaport?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>That is what I meant to say,'' said Dorothea. '' And that would be only natural,'' said the curate. '' Will your majesty please proceed?''
<p/>There is no more to add,'' said Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``save that in finding Don Quixote I have had such good fortune, that I already reckon and regard myself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) courtesy and magnanimity he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) has granted me the boon of accompanying me whithersoever
<p/>I may conduct him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), which will be only to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) face to face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) may slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) and restore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>): for all this must come to pass satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient foretold it, who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or Greek characters -LRB-for I cannot read them-RRB-, that if this predicted knight, after having cut the giant's throat, should be disposed to marry me
<p/>I was to offer myself at once without demur as his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lawful wife, and yield him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) possession of my kingdom together with my person.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div>'' '' What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?'' said Don Quixote at this. '' Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee so?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On my oath it is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and foul fortune to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who won't marry after slitting Senor Pandahilado's windpipe!
<p/>See how we have already got a kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>And then, how ill-favoured the queen is!
<p/>And so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of extreme satisfaction, and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea's mule, and checking it fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand to kiss in token of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) acknowledgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) queen and mistress.
<p/>Which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see the madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant?
<p/>Dorothea therefore gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand, and promised to make him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) a great lord in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) kingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to recover and enjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them all laughing again.
<p/>This, sirs,'' continued Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``is my story; it only remains to tell you that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom
<p/>I have none left except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in a great tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) and I came to land on a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the whole course of my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed; and if I have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as I ought, let it be accounted for by what the licentiate said at the beginning of my tale, that constant and excessive troubles deprive the sufferers of their memory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div><p/>They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``however great and unexampled those which I shall endure in your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have promised you, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until I find myself in the presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head I trust by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this--

<p/>I wish the fleas in my bed were that sort! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' -I say no more--it is impossible for me for a moment to contemplate marriage, even with a Phoenix.
<p/>The last words of his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) master about not wanting to marry were so disagreeable to Sancho that raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) exclaimed with great irritation: <div class="bookquote">``By my oath, Senor Don Quixote, you are not in your right senses; for how can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted princess as this?

<p/>Not she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>); nor half as fair; and I will even go so far as to say she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) does not come up to the shoe of this one here.
<p/>A poor chance I have of getting that county I am waiting for if your worship goes looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea.
<p/>In the devil's name, marry, marry, and take this kingdom that comes to hand without any trouble, and when you are king make me a marquis or governor of a province, and for the rest let the devil take it all.
<p/>Don Quixote, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard such blasphemies uttered against his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pike, without saying anything to Sancho or uttering a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) two such thwacks that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea cried out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would have no doubt taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) life on the spot.

<p/>While this was going on they saw coming along the road they were following a man mounted on an ass, who when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came close seemed to be a gipsy; but Sancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) saw asses, no sooner beheld the man than he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) to be Gines de Pasamonte; and by the thread of the gipsy he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) got at the ball, his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ass, for it was, in fact, Dapple that carried Pasamonte, who to escape recognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being able to speak the gipsy language, and many more, as well as if they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Pasamonte</b></font>) own.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why dost thou say that, Sancho?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote.

<p/>There was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the first one Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and got clear of them all.
<p/>Sancho hastened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Dapple, and embracing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my comrade?

<p/>They all came up and congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially, who told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that notwithstanding this he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not cancel the order for the three ass-colts, for which Sancho thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>While the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, the curate observed to Dorothea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had shown great cleverness, as well in the story itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance it bore to those of the books of chivalry.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had many times amused herself reading them; but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not know the situation of the provinces or seaports, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had said at haphazard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had landed at Osuna.
<p/>So I saw,'' said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``and for that reason I made haste to say what I did, by which it was all set right.
<p/>But is it not a strange thing to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these figments and lies, simply because they are in the style and manner of the absurdities of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) books?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>So it is,'' said Cardenio; ``and so uncommon and unexampled, that were one to attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But another strange thing about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cardenio</b></font>)</div>said the curate, ``is that, apart from the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can discuss them in a perfectly rational manner, showing that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind is quite clear and composed; so that, provided his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chivalry is not touched upon, no one would take him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound understanding.
<p/>While they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with Sancho, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Friend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell me now, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst thou find Dulcinea?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laughed greatly when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) how your worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) had, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was an honest fellow; I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) too about the galley slaves, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not seen any as yet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So far all goes well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but tell me what jewel was it that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of me?
<p/>For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich jewel as a guerdon for good news,' and acknowledgment of the message.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>That is very likely,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and a good custom it was, to my mind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that was what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I took leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>); and more by token it was sheep's-milk cheese.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) is generous in the extreme,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) did not give thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) had not one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter; I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) and all shall be made right.
<p/>It seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to El Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there.
<p/>From which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who is my friend, and watches over my interests -LRB-for of necessity there is and must be one, or else
<p/>I should not be a right knight-errant-RRB-, that this same, I say, must have helped thee to travel without thy knowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errant sleeping in his (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) bed, and without his (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) knowing how or in what way it happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away from the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) went to sleep.
<p/>And if it were not for this, knights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril, as they do at every turn.
<p/>For a knight, maybe, is fighting in the mountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent, or another knight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point of death; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) least looks for it, there appears over against him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on a cloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), who just before had been in England, and who takes his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) part, and delivers him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from death; and at night he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) finds himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own quarters supping very much to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will have been two or three thousand leagues.
<p/>And all this is done by the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant knights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that thou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such a short time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it.''

<p/>Master Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted to halt and drink at a little spring there was there.
<p/>Don Quixote drew up, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was by this time weary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tripping, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of El Toboso, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) life.
<p/>Cardenio had now put on the clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and though they were not very good, they were far better than those he (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) put off.
<p/>They dismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what the curate had provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though not very well, the keen appetite they all of them brought with them.
<p/>While they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next moment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) round the legs, began to weep freely, saying, <div class="bookquote">``O, senor, do you not know me?

<p/>Don Quixote recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) turned to those present and said: <div class="bookquote">``That your worships may see how important it is to have knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by tyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days ago passing through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of a person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my bounden duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed, and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you, which in my heart I rejoice at, for his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) testimony will not permit me to depart from the truth in any particular.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was, I say, tied to an oak, naked from the waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found to be his (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) master, was scarifying him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) by lashes with the reins of his (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) mare.
<p/>The boor replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) was flogging him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from dishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, `Senor, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flogs me only because I ask for my wages.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As soon as I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) I asked the reason of so cruel a flagellation. The master made I know not what speeches and explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did not accept.
<p/>In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>), and to swear he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) would take him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>), and pay him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) real by real, and perfumed into the bargain.

<p/>Answer without hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may see that it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant abroad.''
<p/>All that your worship has said is quite true,'' answered the lad; <div class="bookquote">``but the end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worship supposes.
<p/>Is not all this true, Andres my son? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``How! the opposite?''

<p/>In short he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartholomew</b></font>) left me in such a condition that I have been until now in a hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally clown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for if you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for you, nor meddled in other people's affairs, my master would have been content with giving me one or two dozen lashes, and would have then loosed me and paid me what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) owed me; but when your worship abused him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) so out of measure, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) so many hard words, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) anger was kindled; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could not revenge himself on you, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) saw you had left him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) the storm burst upon me in such a way, that I feel as if I should never be a man again.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) meant to go in search of this clown and chastise him (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) for such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the last maravedi, despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world.

<p/>That is true,'' said Don Quixote, ``and Andres must have patience until my return as you say, senora; but I once more swear and promise not to stop until I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) avenged and paid.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no faith in those oaths,''  (<font color='red'><b>Andres</b></font>)</div>said Andres; ``I would rather have now something to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in the world; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give it me, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may their errands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me.
<p/>Sancho took out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) store a piece of bread and another of cheese, and giving them to the lad he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Here, take this, brother Andres, for we have all of us a share in your misfortune.''

<p/>Andres seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) anything more, bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) head, and took hold of the road, as the saying is.
<p/>However, before leaving he (<font color='blue'><b>Andres</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``For the love of God, sir knight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see them cutting me to pieces, give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my misfortune, which will not be so great but that a greater will come to me by being helped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errant that have ever been born God send his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) curse.

<p/>Their dainty repast being finished, they saddled at once, and without any adventure worth mentioning they reached next day the inn, the object of Sancho Panza's fear and dread; but though he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) would have rather not entered it, there was no help for it.
<p/>The landlady, the landlord, their daughter, and Maritornes, when they saw Don Quixote and Sancho coming, went out to welcome them with signs of hearty satisfaction, which Don Quixote received with dignity and gravity, and bade them make up a better bed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) than the last time: to which the landlady replied that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) paid better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did the last time she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) one fit for a prince.
<p/>Don Quixote said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would, so they made up a tolerable one for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the same garret as before; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want of sleep.
<p/>No sooner was the door shut upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) than the landlady made at the barber, and seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) by the beard, said: ``By my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer; you must give me back tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of my husband's goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I used to stick in my good tail.
<p/>But for all she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the licentiate told him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) to let her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) have it, as there was now no further occasion for that stratagem, because he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) might declare himself and appear in his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) own character, and tell Don Quixote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had fled to this inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); and should he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ask for the princess's squire, they could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) on before her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) to give notice to the people of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) kingdom that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was coming, and bringing with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) the deliverer of them all.
<p/>On this the barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the same time they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect Don Quixote's deliverance.
<p/>All the people of the inn were struck with astonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure of the shepherd Cardenio.
<p/>The curate made them get ready such fare as there was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment, served them up a tolerably good dinner.
<p/>All this time Don Quixote was asleep, and they thought it best not to waken him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), as sleeping would now do him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) more good than eating.
<p/>While at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wife, their daughter, Maritornes, and all the travellers, they discussed the strange craze of Don Quixote and the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had been found; and the landlady told them what had taken place between him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and the carrier; and then, looking round to see if Sancho was there, when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was not, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) gave them the whole story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) blanketing, which they received with no little amusement.
<p/>But on the curate observing that it was the books of chivalry which Don Quixote had read that had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) brain, the landlord said: <div class="bookquote">``I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is no better reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them, with other writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of plenty more; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on holidays, and there is always one among them who can read and who takes up one of these books, and we gather round him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), thirty or more of us, and stay listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow young again.
<p/>At least I can say for myself that when I hear of what furious and terrible blows the knights deliver, I am seized with the longing to do the same, and I would like to be hearing about them night and day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>And I just as much,'' said the landlady, ``because I never have a quiet moment in my house except when you are listening to some one reading; for then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to scold.

 (<font color='red'><b>Maritornes</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' And you, what do you think, young lady?'' said the curate turning to the landlord's daughter. ''
<p/>I don't know indeed, senor,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I listen too, and to tell the truth, though I do not understand it, I like hearing it; but it is not the blows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knights utter when they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they sometimes make me weep with the pity I feel for them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't know what I should do,'' said the girl; ``I only know that there are some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers and lions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus!
<p/>I don't know what sort of folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather than bestow a glance upon a worthy man they leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to die or go mad.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. '' I don't know what is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour's sake, why not marry them?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and going into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own room he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brought out an old valise secured with a little chain, on opening which the curate found in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a very good hand.
<p/>The first that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) opened he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found to be <div class="bookquote">``Don Cirongilio of Thrace,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the second <div class="bookquote">``Don Felixmarte of Hircania,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the other the ``History of the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with the Life of Diego Garcia de Paredes.
<p/>When the curate read the two first titles he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) looked over at the barber and said, <div class="bookquote">``We want my friend's housekeeper and niece here now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``I can do just as well to carry them to the yard or to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.

<p/>And then, what do you say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that was so stout and bold; as may be seen in the book, where it is related that as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the water against him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a fiery serpent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw it, flung himself upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders, and squeezed its throat with both hands with such force that the serpent, finding he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was throttling it, had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the bottom of the river, carrying with it the knight who would not let go his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hold; and when they got down there he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) found himself among palaces and gardens so pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent changed itself into an old ancient man, who told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) such things as were never heard.
<p/>'' Hold your peace, senor; for if you were to hear this you would go mad with delight. A couple of figs for your Great Captain and your Diego Garcia!

<p/>Sancho had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) appearance in the middle of this conversation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was very much troubled and cast down by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heard said about knights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalry being folly and lies; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) resolved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart to wait and see what came of this journey of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's, and if it did not turn out as happily as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) determined to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wife and children and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ordinary labour.
<p/>The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), ``Wait; I want to see what those papers are that are written in such a good hand.
<p/>The landlord taking them out handed them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to read, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of ``Novel of the Ill-advised Curiosity.
<p/>The curate read three or four lines to himself, and said, ``I must say the title of this novel does not seem to me a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and Lothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were called by all that knew them
<p/>They were unmarried, young, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to account for the reciprocal friendship between them.
<p/>Anselmo, it is true, was somewhat more inclined to seek pleasure in love than Lothario, for whom the pleasures of the chase had more attraction; but on occasion Anselmo would forego his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) own tastes to yield to those of Lothario, and Lothario would surrender his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) to fall in with those of Anselmo, and in this way their inclinations kept pace one with the other with a concord so perfect that the best regulated clock could not surpass it.
<p/>Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the same city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable herself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) resolved, with the approval of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) friend Lothario, without whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) did nothing, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) of them in marriage, and did so, Lothario being the bearer of the demand, and conducting the negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) friend that in a short time he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was in possession of the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) desires, and Camilla so happy in having won Anselmo for her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) gave thanks unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario, by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>).
<p/>The first few days, those of a wedding being usually days of merry-making, Lothario frequented his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) friend Anselmo's house as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had been wont, striving to do honour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) and to the occasion, and to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) in every way he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) could; but when the wedding days were over and the succession of visits and congratulations had slackened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) began purposely to leave off going to the house of Anselmo, for it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), as it naturally would to all men of sense, that friends' houses ought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency as in their masters' bachelor days: because, though true and genuine friendship cannot and should not be in any way suspicious, still a married man's honour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liable to injury from brothers, much more from friends.
<p/>Anselmo remarked the cessation of Lothario's visits, and complained of it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), saying that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had known that marriage was to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) from enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) society as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) used, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would have never married; and that, if by the thorough harmony that subsisted between them while he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was a bachelor they had earned such a sweet name as that of <div class="bookquote">``The Two Friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>a bachelor</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) should not allow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through a needless anxiety to act circumspectly; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), if such a phrase was allowable between them, to be once more master of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) house and to come in and go out as formerly, assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wife Camilla had no other desire or inclination than that which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to have, and that knowing how sincerely they loved one another
<p/>'' '' '' '' CHAPTER XXXIII. IN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF ``THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY <div class="bookquote">``The Two Friends. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was grieved to see such coldness in him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) house as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had been in the habit of doing, Lothario replied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was satisfied of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) friend's good intentions, and it was agreed that on two days in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>); but though this arrangement was made between them
<p/>Lothario resolved to observe it no further than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) considered to be in accordance with the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) friend, whose good name was more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) than his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) own.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) said, and justly, that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully what friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) house as what female friends his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) wife associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in the market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations -LRB-opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives-RRB-, may be easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom most confidence is reposed.
<p/>Lothario said, too, that every married man should have some friend who would point out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) any negligence he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) might be guilty of in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) conduct, for it will sometimes happen that owing to the deep affection the husband bears his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife either he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not caution her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), or, not to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), refrains from telling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to do or not to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter of honour or reproach to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and errors of this kind he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could easily correct if warned by a friend.
<p/>Of a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the utmost care and vigilance he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) watched over the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) friend, and strove to diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) house according to their agreement, lest the visits of a young man, wealthy, high-born, and with the attractions he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was conscious of possessing, at the house of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should be regarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the idle public.
<p/>For though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) integrity and reputation might bridle slanderous tongues, still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unwilling to hazard either his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own good name or that of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend; and for this reason most of the days agreed upon he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) devoted to some other business which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pretended was unavoidable; so that a great portion of the day was taken up with complaints on one side and excuses on the other.
<p/>It happened, however, that on one occasion when the two were strolling together outside the city, Anselmo addressed the following words to Lothario.
<p/>But where is such a friend to be found as Lothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and so true? ''
<p/>Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to give sufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me the son of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggard hand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune, and above all for what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has done in giving me thee for a friend and Camilla for a wife--two treasures that I value, if not as highly as I ought, at least as highly as I am able.
<p/>And yet, with all these good things, which are commonly all that men need to enable them to live happily, I am the most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole world; for, I know not how long since, I have been harassed and oppressed by a desire so strange and so unusual, that I wonder at myself and blame and chide myself when I am alone, and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own thoughts, and with no better success than if I were endeavouring deliberately to publish it to all the world; and as, in short, it must come out, I would confide it to thy safe keeping, feeling sure that by this means, and by thy readiness as a true friend to afford me relief, I shall soon find myself freed from the distress it causes me, and that thy care will give me happiness in the same degree as my own folly has caused me misery.
<p/>The words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) strove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) friend, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) conjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety which this perplexity was causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was doing a flagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous methods of confiding to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) most hidden thoughts, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) well knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) might reckon upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) counsel in diverting them, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) help in carrying them into effect.
<p/>That is the truth,'' replied Anselmo, ``and relying upon that I will tell thee, friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is that of knowing whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point except by testing her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded, my friend, that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is or is not tempted; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) alone is strong who does not yield to the promises, gifts, tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what thanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be bad, and what wonder is it that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a husband that will take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) detects her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in an impropriety?
<p/>I do not therefore hold her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in the same estimation as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who comes out of temptation and trial with a crown of victory; and so, for these reasons and many others that I could give thee to justify and support the opinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass this crisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooed and by one worthy to set his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) affections upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>); and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) comes out, as I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look upon my good fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of my desire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says `Who shall find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?' has fallen to my lot.
<p/>And if the result be the contrary of what I expect, in the satisfaction of knowing that I have been right in my opinion, I shall bear without complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me.
<p/>And, as nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me from carrying it into effect, it is my desire, friend Lothario, that thou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this purpose that I am bent upon, for I will afford thee opportunities to that end, and nothing shall be wanting that I may think necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous, honourable, modest and high-minded woman.
<p/>And among other reasons, I am induced to entrust this arduous task to thee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes, but only far enough to account that accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone; thus I shall not be wronged in anything more than intention, and my wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence, which I know well will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me.
<p/>If, therefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life, thou wilt at once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly nor slothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands, and with the loyalty our friendship assures me of.
<p/>Such were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to them with such attention that, except to say what has been already mentioned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) did not open his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) lips until the other had finished.
<p/>Then perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had no more to say, after regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) for awhile, as one would regard something never before seen that excited wonder and amazement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I cannot persuade myself, Anselmo my friend, that what thou hast said to me is not in jest; if I thought that thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed thee to go so far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to thee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do not know thee; but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that I am Lothario
<p/>; the misfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not the Anselmo thou wert, and must have thought that I am not the Lothario I should be; for the things that thou hast said to me are not those of that Anselmo who was my friend, nor are those that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the Lothario thou knowest.
<p/>True friends will prove their friends and make use of them, as a poet has said, usque ad aras; whereby he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) meant that they will not make use of their friendship in things that are contrary to God's will.
<p/>If this, then, was a heathen's feeling about friendship, how much more should it be a Christian's, who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the sake of any human friendship?
<p/>And if a friend should go so far as to put aside his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) duty to Heaven to fulfil his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) duty to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) friend, it should not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment, but in such as affect the friend's life and honour.
<p/>Now tell me, Anselmo, in which of these two art thou imperilled, that I should hazard myself to gratify thee, and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me?
<p/>Neither forsooth; on the contrary, thou dost ask of me, so far as I understand, to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life, and to rob myself of them at the same time; for if I take away thy honour it is plain
<p/>I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worse than dead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so much wrong to thee, shall not
<p/>Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not impatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching the object of thy desire, for there will be time enough left for thee to reply and for me to hear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' I, too, be left without honour, and consequently without life? <div class="bookquote">``Be it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anselmo</b></font>)</div>said Anselmo, ``say what thou wilt.
<p/>Lothario then went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine is just now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can never be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the Holy Scriptures, or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the understanding or are founded upon the articles of faith, but must have examples that are palpable, easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not admitting of doubt, with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be denied, like, `If equals be taken from equals, the remainders are equal:' and if they do not understand this in words, and indeed they do not, it has to be shown to them with the hands, and put before their eyes, and even with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of the truth of our holy religion.
<p/>This same mode of proceeding I shall have to adopt with thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so absurd and remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, that I feel it would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy simplicity, for at present I will call it by no other name; and I am even tempted to leave thee in thy folly as a punishment for thy pernicious desire; but the friendship I bear thee, which will not allow me to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruction, keeps me from dealing so harshly by thee.
<p/>Anselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit upon a modest woman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that is pure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lothario</b></font>)</div>And that thou mayest clearly see this, say, Yes, thou hast told me so. Then, if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous, pure-minded and prudent, what is it that thou seekest?
<p/>And if thou believest that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will come forth victorious from all my attacks--as doubtless she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would-- what higher titles than those she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) possesses now dost
<p/>thou think thou canst upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) then, or in what will she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) be better then than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is now? Either thou dost not hold her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be what thou sayest, or thou knowest
<p/>If thou dost not hold her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be what thou why dost thou seek to prove her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) instead of treating her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as guilty in the way that may seem best to thee?
<p/>but if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) be as virtuous as thou believest, it is an uncalled-for proceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, after trial, it will but be in the same estimation as before.
<p/>not what thou dost demand. Thus, then, it is conclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather than advantage may come to us
<p/>is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds, more especially when they are things which we are not forced or compelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it is plainly madness to attempt them.
<p/>Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sake of the world, or for both; those undertaken for God's sake are those which the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of angels in human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are those of the men who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a variety of climates, so many strange countries, to acquire what are called the blessings of fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of God and the world together are those of brave soldiers, who no sooner do they see in the enemy's wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could make, than, casting aside all fear, without hesitating, or heeding the manifest peril that threatens them, borne onward by the desire of defending their faith, their country, and their king, they fling themselves dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deaths that await them.
<p/>Such are the things that men are wont to attempt, and there is honour, glory, gain, in attempting them, however full of difficulty and peril they may be; but that which thou sayest it is thy wish to attempt and carry out will not win thee the glory of God nor the blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if the issue be as thou wouldst have it
<p/>, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or more honoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt be reduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will avail thee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that has befallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thou knowest it thyself.
<p/>And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, let me repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo at the end of the first part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luigi</b></font>) `Tears of Saint Peter,' which says thus: The anguish and the shame but greater grew In Peter's heart as morning slowly came; No eye was there to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), well he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knew,
<p/>Exposed to all men's gaze, or screened from view, A noble heart will feel the pang the same; A prey to shame the sinning soul will be, Though none but heaven and earth its shame can see.
<p/>Thus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather thou wilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears of blood from the heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poet tells us of, that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo, better advised, refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction it contains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation.
<p/>Moreover by what I am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the great error thou wouldst commit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master and lawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence and purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been satisfied, saying with one voice and common consent that in purity, quality, and fineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could possibly be, thou thyself too being of the same belief, as knowing nothing to the contrary, would it be reasonable in thee to desire to take that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer, and by mere force of blows and strength of arm try if it were as hard and as fine as they said?
<p/>And if thou didst, and if the stone should resist so silly a test, that would add nothing to its value or reputation; and if it were broken, as it might be, would not all be lost?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) himself was to himself a shame; Undoubtedly it would, leaving its owner to be rated as a fool in the opinion of all.
<p/>Consider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla is a diamond of the finest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of others, and that it is contrary to reason to expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to the risk of being broken; for if she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) remains intact
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) cannot rise to a higher value than she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) now possesses; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) give way and be unable to resist, bethink thee now how thou wilt be deprived of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), and with what good reason thou wilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) ruin and thine own.
<p/>Remember there is no jewel in the world so precious as a chaste and virtuous woman, and that the whole honour of women consists in reputation; and since thy wife's is of that high excellence that thou knowest, wherefore
<p/>Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, and that impediments are not to be placed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trip and fall, but that they should be removed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) path left clear of all obstacles, so that without hindrance she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may run her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) course freely to attain the desired perfection, which consists in being virtuous.
<p/>Naturalists tell us that the ermine is a little animal which has a fur of purest white, and that when the hunters wish to take it, they make use of this artifice.
<p/>Having ascertained the places which it frequents and passes, they stop the way to them with mud, and then rousing it, drive it towards the spot, and as soon as the ermine comes to the mud it halts, and allows itself to be taken captive rather than pass through the mire, and spoil and sully its whiteness, which it values more than life and liberty.
<p/>The virtuous and chaste woman is an ermine, and whiter and purer than snow is the virtue of modesty; and he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) who wishes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not to lose it, but to keep and preserve it, must adopt a course different from that employed with the ermine; he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) must not put before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the mire of the gifts and attentions of persevering lovers, because perhaps--and even without a perhaps--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may not have sufficient virtue and natural strength in herself to pass through and tread under foot these impediments; they must be removed, and the brightness of virtue and the beauty of a fair fame must be put before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>A virtuous woman, too, is like a mirror, of clear shining crystal, liable to be tarnished and dimmed by every breath that touches it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be protected and prized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of roses and flowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or pluck a blossom; enough for others that from afar and through the iron grating they may enjoy its fragrance and its beauty.
<p/>Finally let me repeat to thee some verses that come to my mind; I heard them in a modern comedy, and it seems to me they bear upon the point we are discussing.
<p/>A prudent old man was giving advice to another, the father of a young girl, to lock her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up, watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in seclusion, and among other arguments he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) used these: Woman is a thing of glass; But her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) brittleness 'tis best Not too curiously to test: Who knows what may come to pass?
<p/>Breaking is an easy matter, And it's folly to expose What you cannot mend to blows; What you can't make whole to shatter.
<p/>This, then, all may hold as true, And the reason's plain to see; For if Danaes there be, There are golden showers too.
<p/>All that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to what concerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of what regards myself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth into which thou hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricate thee makes it necessary.
<p/>shouldst thou seek to call that truth in question? She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must be treated as relics are; adored, not touched. '' ''
<p/>Thou dost reckon me thy friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, a thing wholly inconsistent with friendship; and not only dost thou aim at this, but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also.
<p/>me of it is clear, for when Camilla sees that I pay court to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) as thou requirest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) will certainly regard me as a man without honour or right feeling, since I attempt and do a thing so much opposed to what I owe to my own position and thy friendship.
<p/>thee of it is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I press my suit upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), will suppose that I have perceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) something light that has encouraged me to make known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) my base desire; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) holds herself dishonoured, her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) dishonour touches thee as belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>); and hence arises what so commonly takes place, that the husband of the adulterous woman, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may not be aware of or have given any cause for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's failure in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) duty, or -LRB-being careless or negligent-RRB- have had it in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) power to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dishonour, nevertheless is stigmatised by a vile and reproachful name, and in a manner regarded with eyes of contempt instead of pity by all who know of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's guilt, though they see that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is unfortunate not by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own fault, but by the lust of a vicious consort.
<p/>But I will tell thee why with good reason dishonour attaches to the husband of the unchaste wife, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) know not that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is so, nor be to blame, nor have done anything, or given any provocation to make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so; and be not weary with listening to me, for it will be for thy good.
<p/>When God created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the Holy Scripture says that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) infused sleep into Adam and while he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) slept took a rib from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left side of which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) formed our mother Eve, and when Adam awoke and beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) said, `This is flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone.'
<p/>For this shall a man leave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted the divine sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone can loose them.
<p/>And such is the force and virtue of this miraculous sacrament that it makes two different persons one and the same flesh; and even more than this when the virtuous are married; for though they have two souls they have but one will.
<p/>And hence it follows that as the flesh of the wife is one and the same with that of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband the stains that may come upon it, or the injuries it incurs fall upon the husband's flesh, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as has been said, may have given no cause for them; for as the pain of the foot or any member of the body is felt by the whole body, because all is one flesh, as the head feels the hurt to the ankle without having caused it, so the husband, being one with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all worldly honour or dishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erring wife's is of that kind, the husband must needs bear his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) part of it and be held dishonoured without knowing it.
<p/>See, then, Anselmo, the peril thou art encountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort; see for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse up passions that now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife; reflect that what thou art staking all to win is little, and what thou wilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having the words to express it.
<p/>But if all I have said be not enough to turn thee from thy vile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonour and misfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I lose thy friendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive.
<p/>Having said this, the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, and Anselmo, troubled in mind and deep in thought, was unable for a while to utter a word in reply; but at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have listened,
<p/>That thou wouldst rob That thou wouldst have me rob ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And God said ' '' Lothario my friend, attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hast chosen to say to me, and
<p/>in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons I have seen that high intelligence thou dost possess, and the perfection of true friendship thou hast reached; and likewise I see and confess that if I am not guided by thy opinion, but follow my own, I am flying from the good and pursuing the evil.
<p/>This being so, thou must remember that I am now labouring under that infirmity which women sometimes suffer from, when the craving seizes them to eat clay, plaster, charcoal, and things even worse, disgusting to look at, much more to eat; so that it will be necessary to have recourse to some artifice to cure me; and this can be easily effected if only thou wilt make a beginning, even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believe fashion, to pay court to Camilla, who will not be so yielding that her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) virtue will give way at the first attack: with this mere attempt I shall rest satisfied, and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee to do, not only in giving me life, but in persuading me not to discard my honour.
<p/>And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone, that, being, as I am, resolved to apply this test, it is not for thee to permit me to reveal my weakness to another, and so imperil that honour thou art striving to keep me from losing; and if thine may not stand as high as it ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art paying court to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), that is of little or no importance, because ere long, on finding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) that constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) the plain truth as regards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) esteem; and as thou art venturing so little, and by the venture canst afford me so much satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even if further difficulties present themselves to thee; for, as I have said, if thou wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issue decided.
<p/>Lothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowing what further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) from it, and perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) threatened to confide his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) pernicious scheme to some one else, to avoid a greater evil resolved to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) and do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) asked, intending to manage the business so as to satisfy Anselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so in reply he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) not to communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) purpose to any other, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would undertake the task himself, and would begin it as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) pleased.
<p/>Anselmo embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) warmly and affectionately, and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) offer as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had bestowed some great favour upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>); and it was agreed between them to set about it the next day, Anselmo affording opportunity and time to Lothario to converse alone with Camilla, and furnishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) with money and jewels to offer and present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) suggested, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) should treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to music, and write verses in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) praise, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was unwilling to take the trouble of composing them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) offered to do it himself.
<p/>Lothario agreed to all with an intention very different from what Anselmo supposed, and with this understanding they returned to Anselmo's house, where they found Camilla awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband anxiously and uneasily, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was later than usual in returning that day.
<p/>Lothario repaired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) own house, and Anselmo remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), as well satisfied as Lothario was troubled in mind; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) could see no satisfactory way out of this ill-advised business.
<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) went to dine with his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) friend, and was welcomed by Camilla, who received and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) with great cordiality, knowing the affection her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>When dinner was over and the cloth removed, Anselmo told Lothario to stay there with Camilla while he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) attended to some pressing business, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would return in an hour and a half.
<p/>Camilla begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) not to go, and Lothario offered to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), but nothing could persuade Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had a matter of great importance to discuss with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>).
<p/>'' That night, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) thought of a plan by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) might deceive Anselmo without any injury to Camilla. At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) came back.
<p/>In short he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) contrived to put so good a face on the reason, or the folly, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) absence that no one could have suspected it was a pretence.
<p/>Anselmo took his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone at the table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner.
<p/>Lothario saw himself in the lists according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) friend's wish, and facing an enemy that could by her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed knights; judge whether he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had good reason to fear; but what he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) did was to lean his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) elbow on the arm of the chair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) cheek upon his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) hand, and, asking Camilla's pardon for his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) ill manners, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) wished to take a little sleep until Anselmo returned.
<p/>Camilla in reply said he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) could repose more at his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) ease in the reception-room than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) chair, and begged of him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to go in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) remained asleep until the return of Anselmo, who finding Camilla in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had stayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough for conversation and even for sleep, and was all impatience until Lothario should wake up, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) might go out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) and question him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) success.
<p/>Everything fell out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) wished; Lothario awoke, and the two at once left the house, and Anselmo asked what he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was anxious to know, and Lothario in answer told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had not thought it advisable to declare himself entirely the first time, and therefore had only extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) that all the city spoke of nothing else but her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) beauty and wit, for this seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) an excellent way of beginning to gain her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) good-will and render her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) disposed to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) with pleasure the next time, thus availing himself of the device the devil has recourse to when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) would deceive one who is on the watch; for he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) being the angel of darkness transforms himself into an angel of light, and, under cover of a fair seeming, discloses himself at length, and effects his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) purpose if at the beginning his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wiles are not discovered.
<p/>All this gave great satisfaction to Anselmo, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would afford the same opportunity every day, but without leaving the house, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would find things to do at home so that Camilla should not detect the plot.
<p/>Thus, then, several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a word to Camilla, reported to Anselmo that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had never been able to draw from her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) the slightest indication of consent to anything dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of hope; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband of it.
<p/>'' So far well,'' said Anselmo; <div class="bookquote">``Camilla has thus far resisted words; we must now see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) will resist deeds.
<p/>I will give you to-morrow two thousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even present, and as many more to buy jewels to lure her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), for women are fond of being becomingly attired and going gaily dressed, and all the more so if they are beautiful, however chaste they may be; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) resists this temptation, I will rest satisfied and will give you no more trouble.
<p/>Lothario replied that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had begun he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) would carry on the undertaking to the end, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) perceived he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was to come out of it wearied and vanquished.
<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) received the four thousand crowns, and with them four thousand perplexities, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) knew not what to say by way of a new falsehood; but in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) mind to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) that Camilla stood as firm against gifts and promises as against words, and that there was no use in taking any further trouble, for the time was all spent to no purpose.
<p/>But chance, directing things in a different manner, so ordered it that Anselmo, having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions, shut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen through the keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that for more than half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor would utter a word though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) were to be there for an age; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) came to the conclusion that what his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) friend had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) about the replies of Camilla was all invention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it were so
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Anselmo</b></font>)</div>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) came out, and calling Lothario aside asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) what news he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had and in what humour Camilla was.
<p/>Lothario replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was not disposed to go on with the business, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) so angrily and harshly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had no heart to say anything more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>).
<p/>Ah, Lothario, Lothario,'' said Anselmo, <div class="bookquote">``how ill dost thou meet thy obligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee!
<p/>I have been just now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou has not said a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former occasions thou hast not spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) either, and if this be so, as no doubt it is, why dost thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou by craft to deprive me of the means I might find of attaining my desire?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anselmo</b></font>)</div><p/>Anselmo said no more, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had said enough to cover Lothario with shame and confusion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), feeling as it were his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) honour touched by having been detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would from that moment devote himself to satisfying him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) without any deception, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had the curiosity to watch; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) need not take the trouble, for the pains he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would take to satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would remove all suspicions from his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Anselmo believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), and to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) an opportunity more free and less liable to surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) resolved to absent himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) house for eight days, betaking himself to that of a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) who lived in a village not far from the city; and, the better to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) departure to Camilla, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) so arranged it that the friend should send him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a very pressing invitation.
<p/>'' Unhappy, shortsighted Anselmo, what art thou doing, what art thou plotting, what art thou devising? Bethink thee thou art working against thyself, plotting thine own dishonour, devising thine own ruin.
<p/>Thy wife Camilla is virtuous, thou dost possess her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) in peace and quietness, no one assails thy happiness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) thoughts wander not beyond the walls of thy house,
<p/>thou art her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) heaven on earth, the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) wishes, the fulfilment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) desires, the measure wherewith she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) measures her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) will, making it conform in all things to thine and Heaven's.
<p/>If, then, the mine of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) honour, beauty, virtue, and modesty yields thee without labour all the wealth it contains and thou canst wish for, why wilt thou dig the earth in search of fresh veins, of new unknown treasure, risking the collapse of all, since it but rests on the feeble props of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) weak nature?
<p/>Bethink thee that from him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) who seeks impossibilities that which is possible may with justice be withheld, as was better expressed by a poet who said: 'Tis mine to seek for life in death, Health in disease seek I, I seek in prison freedom's breath,
<p/>So Fate that ever scorns to grant Or grace or boon to me, Since what can never be I want, Denies me what might be.
<p/>The next day Anselmo took his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) departure for the village, leaving instructions with Camilla that during his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) absence Lothario would come to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) house and to dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would himself.
<p/>Camilla was distressed, as a discreet and right-minded woman would be, at the orders her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband left her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) remember that it was not becoming that anyone should occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seat at the table during his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) absence, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) acted thus from not feeling confidence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would be able to manage his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) house, let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) try her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) this time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would find by experience that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was equal to greater responsibilities.
<p/>In traitors loyalty. Anselmo replied that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) pleasure to have it so, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had only to submit and obey.
<p/>Anselmo went, and the next day Lothario came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) house, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was received by Camilla with a friendly and modest welcome; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) never suffered Lothario to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) alone, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was always attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) men and women servants, especially by a handmaid of hers,
<p/>Leonela by name, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was much attached -LRB-for they had been brought up together from childhood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) father's house-RRB-, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had kept with her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) after her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) marriage with Anselmo.
<p/>The first three days Lothario did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) might have done so when they removed the cloth and the servants retired to dine hastily; for such were Camilla's orders; nay more, Leonela had directions to dine earlier than Camilla and never to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), however, having her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) thoughts fixed upon other things more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) taste, and wanting that time and opportunity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) own pleasures, did not always obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) mistress's commands, but on the contrary left them alone, as if they had ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to do so; but the modest bearing of Camilla, the calmness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) countenance, the composure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) aspect were enough to bridle the tongue of Lothario.
<p/>But the influence which the many virtues of Camilla exerted in imposing silence on Lothario's tongue proved mischievous for both of them, for if his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) tongue was silent his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) thoughts were busy, and could dwell at leisure upon the perfections of Camilla's goodness and beauty one by one, charms enough to warm with love a marble statue, not to say a heart of flesh.
<p/>Lothario gazed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) might have been speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), and thought how worthy of being loved she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was; and thus reflection began little by little to assail his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) allegiance to Anselmo, and a thousand times he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) thought of withdrawing from the city and going where Anselmo should never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) see Camilla.
<p/>Camilla said she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would do so, though against her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) will. But already the delight he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) found in gazing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) interposed and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) fast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) put a constraint upon himself, and struggled to repel and repress the pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) found in contemplating Camilla; when alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) blamed himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) weakness, called himself a bad friend, nay a bad Christian; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) argued the matter and compared himself with Anselmo; always coming to the conclusion that the folly and rashness of Anselmo had been worse than his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) faithlessness, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) could excuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) intentions as easily before God as with man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had no reason to fear any punishment for his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) offence.
<p/>In short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with the opportunity which the blind husband had placed in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands, overthrew the loyalty of Lothario; and giving heed to nothing save the object towards which his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) inclinations led him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), after Anselmo had been three days absent, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had been carrying on a continual struggle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) passion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) began to make love to Camilla with so much vehemence and warmth of language that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was overwhelmed with amazement, and could only rise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) place and retire to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) room without answering him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) a word.
<p/>But the hope which always springs up with love was not weakened in Lothario by this repelling demeanour; on the contrary his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) passion for Camilla increased, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) discovering in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had never expected, knew not what to do; and considering it neither safe nor right to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) the chance or opportunity of speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) resolved to send, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) did that very night, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) servants with a letter to Anselmo, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) addressed the following words to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>).
<p/>``It is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and a castle without its castellan, and I say that a young married woman looks still worse without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband unless there are very good reasons for it.
<p/>I find myself so ill at ease without you, and so incapable of enduring this separation, that unless you return quickly I shall have to go for relief to my parents' house, even if I leave yours without a protector; for the one you left me, if indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deserved that title, has, I think, more regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own pleasure than to what concerns you: as you are possessed of discernment I need say no more to you, nor indeed is it fitting
<p/>Anselmo received this letter, and from it he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) gathered that Lothario had already begun his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) task and that Camilla must have replied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) would have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) sent word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) not to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) house on any account, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) would very shortly return.
<p/>Camilla was astonished at Anselmo's reply, which placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) in greater perplexity than before, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) neither dared to remain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) own house, nor yet to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) parents'; for in remaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) virtue was imperilled, and in going she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was opposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband's commands.
<p/>Finally she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) decided upon what was the worse course for her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), to remain, resolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) might not give food for gossip to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) servants; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) now began to regret having written as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband, fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might imagine that Lothario had perceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) some lightness which had impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) to lay aside the respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>); but confident of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) rectitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) trust in God and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) own virtuous intentions, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) hoped to resist in silence all the solicitations of Lothario, without saying anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband so as not to involve him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) in any quarrel or trouble; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) even began to consider how to excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) should ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) what it was that induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to write that letter.
<p/>With these resolutions, more honourable than judicious or effectual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) remained the next day listening to Lothario, who pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) suit so strenuously that Camilla's firmness began to waver, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) virtue had enough to do to come to the rescue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) eyes and keep them from showing signs of a certain tender compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario had awakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE NOVEL OF <div class="bookquote">``THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I should say more. '' Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) all the more.
<p/>In short he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) felt that while Anselmo's absence afforded time and opportunity he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) must press the siege of the fortress, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) assailed her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) self-esteem with praises of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) beauty, for there is nothing that more quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair women's vanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery.
<p/>In fact with the utmost assiduity he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) undermined the rock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) purity with such engines that had Camilla been of brass she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) must have fallen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) wept, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) entreated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) promised, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) flattered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) importuned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) pretended with so much feeling and apparent sincerity, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) overthrew the virtuous resolves of Camilla and won the triumph he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) least expected and most longed for.
<p/>A clear proof to us that the passion of love is to be conquered only by flying from it, and that no one should engage in a struggle with an enemy so mighty; for divine strength is needed to overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) human power.
<p/>Camilla yielded, Camilla fell; but what wonder if the friendship of Lothario could not stand firm? Leonela alone knew of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) mistress's weakness, for the two false friends and new lovers were unable to conceal it.
<p/>Lothario did not care to tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view, nor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) the opportunity of attaining such a result, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) should undervalue his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) love and think that it was by chance and without intending it and not of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) own accord that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had made love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>).
<p/>A few days later Anselmo returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) house and did not perceive what it had lost, that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) so lightly treated and so highly prized.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) went at once to see Lothario, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) at home; they embraced each other, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) life or his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) death.
<p/>The tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend,'' said Lothario, <div class="bookquote">``are that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and crown of all good wives.
<p/>The words that I have addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were borne away on the wind, my promises have been despised, my presents have been refused, such feigned tears as I shed have been turned into open ridicule.
<p/>In short, as Camilla is the essence of all beauty, so is she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) the treasure-house where purity dwells, and gentleness and modesty
<p/>Take back thy money, my friend; here it is, and I have had no need to touch it, for the chastity of Camilla yields not to things so base as gifts or promises.
<p/>Be content, Anselmo, and refrain from making further proof; and as thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts and suspicions that are and may be entertained of women, seek not to plunge again into the deep ocean of new embarrassments, or with another pilot make trial of the goodness and strength of the bark that Heaven has granted thee for thy passage across the sea of this world; but reckon thyself now safe in port, moor thyself with the anchor of sound reflection, and rest in peace until thou art called upon to pay that debt which no nobility on earth can escape paying.
<p/>Anselmo was completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believed them as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) begged of him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) not to relinquish the undertaking, were it but for the sake of curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) need not make use of the same earnest endeavours as before; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to do was to write some verses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), praising her (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) under the name of Chloris, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) himself would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was in love with a lady to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had given that name to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to sing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) praises with the decorum due to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) modesty; and if Lothario were unwilling to take the trouble of writing the verses he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) would compose them himself.
<p/>That will not be necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lothario</b></font>)</div>said Lothario, <div class="bookquote">``for the muses are not such enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course of the year.
<p/>Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a pretended amour of mine; as for the verses will make them, and if not as good as the subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can produce.
<p/>An agreement to this effect was made between the friends, the ill-advised one and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) house asked Camilla the question she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) already wondered he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had not asked before--what it was that had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to write the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>).
<p/>Camilla replied that it had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) that Lothario looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) somewhat more freely than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had been at home; but that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was undeceived and believed it to have been only her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) own imagination, for Lothario now avoided seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), or being alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>).
<p/>Anselmo told her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) might be quite easy on the score of that suspicion, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) knew that Lothario was in love with a damsel of rank in the city whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) celebrated under the name of Chloris, and that even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) were not, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) fidelity and their great friendship left no room for fear.
<p/>Had not Camilla, however, been informed beforehand by Lothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) himself had told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes to give utterance to the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would have fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarned she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) received the startling news without uneasiness.
<p/>The next day as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to recite something of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had composed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) mistress Chloris; for as Camilla did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) might safely say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) liked.
<p/>Even did she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) know her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lothario</b></font>)</div>returned Lothario, <div class="bookquote">``I would hide nothing, for when a lover praises his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) lady's beauty, and charges her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with cruelty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) casts no imputation upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fair name; at any rate, all I can say is that yesterday I made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this Chloris, which goes thus:
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lothario</b></font>)</div>abide with all the virtues that can confer praise, honour, and happiness upon a woman. '' '' '' '' SONNET At midnight, in the silence,
<p/>when the eyes Of happier mortals balmy slumbers close, The weary tale of my unnumbered woes To Chloris and to Heaven is wont to rise.
<p/>The portals of the east with tints of rose, With undiminished force my sorrow flows In broken accents and in burning sighs.
<p/>And when the sun ascends his (<font color='blue'><b>mortals</b></font>) star-girt throne, And on the earth pours down his (<font color='blue'><b>mortals</b></font>) midday beams, Noon but renews my wailing and my tears; And with the night again goes up my moan.
<p/>And when the light of day returning dyes Yet ever in my agony it seems To me that neither Heaven nor Chloris hears.
<p/>The sonnet pleased Camilla, and still more Anselmo, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) praised it and said the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for sincerity so manifest.
<p/>As poets they do not tell the truth,'' replied Lothario; <div class="bookquote">``but as lovers they are not more defective in expression than they are truthful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lothario</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no doubt of that,'' observed Anselmo, anxious to support and uphold Lothario's ideas with Camilla, who was as regardless of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) design as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was deep in love with Lothario; and so taking delight in anything that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), and knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) thoughts and writings had her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) for their object, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) herself was the real Chloris, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) to repeat some other sonnet or verses if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) recollected any.
<p/>I do,'' replied Lothario, <div class="bookquote">``but I do not think it as good as the first one, or, more correctly speaking, less bad; but you can easily judge, for it is this.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lothario</b></font>)</div>On which Camilla said, <div class="bookquote">``Then all that love-smitten poets say is true?''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' SONNET I know that I am doomed; death is to me As certain as that thou, ungrateful fair
<p/>, Dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying, ere My heart repented of its love for thee. If buried in oblivion I should be, Bereft of life, fame, favour, even there
<p/>This like some holy relic do I prize To save me from the fate my truth entails, Truth that to thy hard heart its vigour owes.
<p/>It would be found that I thy image bear Deep graven in my breast for all to see. Alas for him (<font color='blue'><b>thee</b></font>)
<p/>Anselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had praised the first; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) went on adding link after link to the chain with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was binding himself and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) dishonour secure; for when Lothario was doing most to dishonour him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was most honoured; and thus each step that Camilla descended towards the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) abasement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) mounted, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) opinion, towards the summit of virtue and fair fame.
<p/>It so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) maid, Camilla said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, how lightly I have valued myself that I did not compel Lothario to purchase by at least some expenditure of time that full possession of me that I so quickly yielded him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) of my own free will.
<p/>I fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) will think ill of my pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible influence he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) brought to bear upon me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let not that trouble you, my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div>said Leonela, <div class="bookquote">``for it does not take away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to give it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized; nay, they are wont to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) who gives quickly gives twice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div><p/>that under lowering skies, In peril o'er a trackless ocean sails, Where neither friendly port nor pole-star shows. '' '' They say also,'' said Camilla, <div class="bookquote">``that what costs little is valued less.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Camilla</b></font>)</div><p/>That saying does not hold good in your case,'' replied Leonela, <div class="bookquote">``for love, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with this one it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it burns; some it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its desires, and at the same moment completes and ends it; in the morning it will lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, for there is no power that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, what do you fear, when the same must have befallen Lothario, love having chosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you?
<p/>and it was absolutely necessary to complete then what love had resolved upon, without affording the time to let Anselmo return and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) presence compel the work to be left unfinished; for love has no better agent for carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) designs than opportunity; and of opportunity he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) avails himself in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) feats, especially at the outset.
<p/>All this I know well myself, more by experience than by hearsay, and some day, senora, I will enlighten you on the subject, for I am of your flesh and blood too.
<p/>Moreover, lady Camilla, you did not surrender yourself or yield so quickly but that first you saw Lothario's whole soul in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) eyes, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) sighs, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) words, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) promises and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) gifts, and by it and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) good qualities perceived how worthy he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was of your love.
<p/>This, then, being the case, let not these scrupulous and prudish ideas trouble your imagination, but be assured that Lothario prizes you as you do him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), and rest content and satisfied that as you are caught in the noose of love it is one of worth and merit that has taken you, and one that has not only the four S's that they say true lovers ought to have, but a complete alphabet; only listen to me and you will see how I can repeat it by rote.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) is to my eyes and thinking, Amiable, Brave, Courteous, Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay, Honourable, Illustrious, Loyal, Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted, Rich, and the S's according to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious:
<p/>X does not suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>), for it is a rough letter; Y has been given already; and Z Zealous for your honour.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div>Camilla laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) maid's alphabet, and perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to be more experienced in love affairs than she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) said, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) admitted, confessing to Camilla that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had love passages with a young man of good birth of the same city.
<p/>Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest it might prove the means of endangering her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) honour, and asked whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) intrigue had gone beyond words, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) with little shame and much effrontery said it had; for certain it is that ladies' imprudences make servants shameless, who, when they see their mistresses make a false step, think nothing of going astray themselves, or of its being known.
<p/>All that Camilla could do was to entreat Leonela to say nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) doings to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) lover, and to conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) own affairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of Anselmo or of Lothario.
<p/>Leonela said she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would, but kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) word in such a way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) confirmed Camilla's apprehension of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) reputation through her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) means; for this abandoned and bold Leonela, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) mistress's demeanour was not what it was wont to be, had the audacity to introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) lover into the house, confident that even if her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) mistress saw him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would not dare to expose him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>);
<p/>for the sins of mistresses entail this mischief among others; they make themselves the slaves of their own servants, and are obliged to hide their laxities and depravities; as was the case with Camilla, who though she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) perceived, not once but many times, that Leonela was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) lover in some room of the house, not only did not dare to chide her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), but afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) opportunities for concealing him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) and removed all difficulties, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should be seen by her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was unable, however, to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) from being seen on one occasion, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sallied forth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was, at first took him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) for a spectre; but, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) hasten away, muffling his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) cloak and concealing himself carefully and cautiously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) rejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, which would have been the ruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy.
<p/>It did not occur to Lothario that this man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen issuing at such an untimely hour from Anselmo's house could have entered it on Leonela's account, nor
<p/>did he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) even remember there was such a person as Leonela; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) thought was that as Camilla had been light and yielding with him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had been with another; for this further penalty the erring woman's sin brings with it, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) honour is distrusted even by him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to whose overtures and persuasions she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) has yielded; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) believes her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to have surrendered more easily to others, and gives implicit credence to every suspicion that comes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) mind.
<p/>All Lothario's good sense seems to have failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) at this juncture; all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) prudent maxims escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) memory; for without once reflecting rationally, and without more ado, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) impatience and in the blindness of the jealous rage that gnawed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) heart, and dying to revenge himself upon Camilla, who had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) no wrong, before Anselmo had risen he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) hastened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), ``Know, Anselmo, that for several days past I have been struggling with myself, striving to withhold from thee what it is no longer possible or right that I should conceal from thee.
<p/>Know that Camilla's fortress has surrendered and is ready to submit to my will; and if I have been slow to reveal this fact to thee, it was in order to see if it were some light caprice of hers, or
<p/>if she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) sought to try me and ascertain if the love I began to make to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) with thy permission was made with a serious intention.
<p/>I thought, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) were what she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) ought to be, and what we both believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), would have ere this given thee information of my addresses; but
<p/>seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) delays, I believe the truth of the promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) has given me that the next time thou art absent from the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) will grant me an interview in the closet where thy jewels are kept -LRB-and it was true that Camilla used to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) there-RRB-; but I do not wish thee to rush precipitately to take vengeance, for the sin is as yet only committed in intention, and Camilla's may change perhaps between this and the appointed time, and repentance spring up in its place.
<p/>As hitherto thou hast always followed my advice wholly or in part, follow and observe this that I will give thee now, so that, without mistake, and with mature deliberation, thou mayest satisfy thyself as to what may seem the best course; pretend to absent thyself for two or three days as thou hast been wont to do on other occasions, and contrive to hide thyself in the closet; for the tapestries and other things there afford great facilities for thy concealment, and then thou wilt see with thine own eyes and I with mine what Camilla's purpose may be.
<p/>And if it be a guilty one, which may be feared rather than expected, with silence, prudence, and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of punishment for the wrong done thee.
<p/>Anselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and astounded at the words of Lothario, which came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) at a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) least expected to hear them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) now looked upon Camilla as having triumphed over the pretended attacks of Lothario, and was beginning to enjoy the glory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) victory.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) remained silent for a considerable time, looking on the ground with fixed gaze, and at length said, <div class="bookquote">``Thou hast behaved, Lothario, as I expected of thy friendship: I will follow thy advice in everything; do as thou wilt, and keep this secret as thou seest it should be kept in circumstances so unlooked for.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Lothario gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) word, but after leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) repented altogether of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), perceiving how foolishly he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had acted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) might have revenged himself upon Camilla in some less cruel and degrading way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) want of sense, condemned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) hasty resolution, and knew not what course to take to undo the mischief or find some ready escape from it.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) decided upon revealing all to Camilla, and, as there was no want of opportunity for doing so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) alone the same day; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had the chance of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), said, <div class="bookquote">``Lothario my friend, I must tell thee I have a sorrow in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready to burst; and it will be a wonder if it does not; for the audacity of Leonela has now reached such a pitch that every night she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) conceals a gallant of hers in this house and remains with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) till morning, at the expense of my reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyone to question it who may see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) quitting my house at such unseasonable hours; but what distresses me is that I cannot punish or chide her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent about hers, while I am dreading that some catastrophe will come of it.
<p/>As Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device to delude him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) into the idea that the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen going out was Leonela's lover and not hers; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw how she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) wept and suffered, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became convinced of the truth, and the conviction completed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confusion and remorse; however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told Camilla not to distress herself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would take measures to put a stop to the insolence of Leonela.
<p/>At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) what, driven by the fierce rage of jealousy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said to Anselmo, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had arranged to hide himself in the closet that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might there see plainly how little she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) fidelity to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) pardon for this madness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) advice as to how to repair it, and escape safely from the intricate labyrinth in which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imprudence had involved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Camilla was struck with alarm at hearing what Lothario said, and with much anger, and great good sense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) reproved him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) and rebuked his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) base design and the foolish and mischievous resolution he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had made; but as woman has by nature a nimbler wit than man for good and for evil, though it is apt to fail when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sets herself deliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of the moment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable, and told Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should conceal himself in the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) mentioned, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) hoped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) concealment to obtain the means of their enjoying themselves for the future without any apprehension; and without revealing her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) purpose to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) entirely she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) charged him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed, to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) when Leonela should call him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), and to all she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to answer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would have answered had he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) not known that Anselmo was listening.
<p/>Lothario pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) intention fully, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) might with more certainty and precaution take care to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) saw to be needful.
<p/>I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Camilla, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing to take care of except to answer me what I shall ask you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla</b></font>)</div>for she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) did not wish to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) beforehand what she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) meant to do, fearing lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) should be unwilling to follow out an idea which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) such a good one, and should try or devise some other less practicable plan.
<p/>Lothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo, under pretence of going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) friend's country house, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) departure, and then returned to conceal himself, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was able to do easily, as Camilla and Leonela took care to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) the opportunity; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) placed himself in hiding in the state of agitation that it may be imagined he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would feel who expected to see the vitals of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) honour laid bare before his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) eyes, and found himself on the point of losing the supreme blessing he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) possessed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) beloved Camilla.
<p/>Having made sure of Anselmo's being in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) hiding-place, Camilla and Leonela entered the closet, and the instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) set foot within it
<p/>dear Leonela, would it not be better, before I do what I am unwilling you should know lest you should seek to prevent it, that you should take Anselmo's dagger that I have asked of you and with it pierce this vile heart of mine?
<p/>'' '' '' '' Camilla said, with a deep sigh, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! But no ; there is no reason why I should suffer the punishment of another's fault.
<p/>I will first know what it is that the bold licentious eyes of Lothario have seen in me that could have encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) to reveal to me a design so base as that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) has disclosed regardless of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) friend and of my honour.
<p/>Go to the window, Leonela, and call him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), for no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) is in the street waiting to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) vile project; but mine, cruel it may be, but honourable, shall be carried out first.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div>said the crafty Leonela, who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) part, <div class="bookquote">``what is it you want to do with this dagger?
<p/>Can it be that you mean to take your own life, or Lothario's? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead to the loss of your reputation and good name.
<p/>It is better to dissemble your wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the house now and finding us alone; consider, senora, we are weak women and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a man, and determined, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes with such a base purpose, blind and urged by passion, perhaps before you can put yours into execution he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may do what will be worse for you than taking your life.
<p/>And supposing you kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), senora, as I suspect you mean to do, what shall we do with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is dead?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div><p/>'' replied Camilla, ``we shall leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for Anselmo to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>); for in reason it will be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) a light labour to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) own infamy under ground.
<p/>Summon him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), make haste, for all the time I delay in taking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against the loyalty I owe my husband.
<p/>Anselmo was listening to all this, and every word that Camilla uttered made him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) change his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) mind; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) heard that it was resolved to kill Lothario his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) first impulse was to come out and show himself to avert such a disaster; but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) anxiety to see the issue of a resolution so bold and virtuous
<p/>Ill betide my master, Anselmo, for giving such authority in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) house to this shameless fellow! <div class="bookquote">``What, my friend? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) restrained himself, intending to come forth in time to prevent the deed.
<p/>At this moment Camilla, throwing herself upon a bed that was close by, swooned away, and Leonela began to weep bitterly, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Woe is me!
<p/>that I should be fated to have dying here in my arms the flower of virtue upon earth, the crown of true wives, the pattern of chastity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div>with more to the same effect, so that anyone who heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) for the most tender-hearted and faithful handmaid in the world, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) mistress for another persecuted Penelope.
<p/>Camilla was not long in recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) fainting fit and on coming to herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) said, ``Why do you not go, Leonela, to call hither that friend, the falsest to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) friend the sun ever shone upon or night concealed?
<p/>lest the fire of my wrath burn itself out with delay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for melt away in menaces and maledictions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am just going to call him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div>said Leonela; <div class="bookquote">``but you must first give me that dagger, lest while I am gone
<p/>Away, run, haste, speed! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div>you should by means of it give cause to all who love you to weep all their lives.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla</b></font>)</div>said Camilla, <div class="bookquote">``for rash and foolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my honour, I am not going to be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed herself without having done anything wrong, and without having first killed him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) on whom the guilt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) misfortune lay.
<p/>I shall die, if I am to die; but it must be after full vengeance upon him (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) who has brought me here to weep over audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Camilla</b></font>)</div><p/>Leonela required much pressing before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) would go to summon Lothario, but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) went, and while awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) return Camilla continued, as if speaking to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Good God!
<p/>would it not have been more prudent to have repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before, than to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile, even for the short time I must wait until I undeceive him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>)?
<p/>No doubt it would have been better; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of my husband vindicated, should he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) find so clear and easy an escape from the strait into which his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) depravity has led him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Let the traitor pay with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life for the temerity of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanton wishes, and let the world know -LRB-if haply it shall ever come to know-RRB- that Camilla not only preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) allegiance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband, but avenged him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of the man who dared to wrong him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>But then I have called his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) attention to it in the letter I wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in the country, and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did nothing to prevent the mischief I there pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), I suppose it was that from pure goodness of heart and trustfulness he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not and could not believe that any thought against his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) honour could harbour in the breast of so stanch a friend; nor indeed did I myself believe it for many days, nor should I have ever believed it if his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) insolence had not gone so far as to make it manifest by open presents, lavish promises, and ceaseless tears.
<p/>Still, I think it might be better to disclose this to Anselmo. But why do I argue thus? Does a bold determination stand in need of arguments?
<p/>Surely not. Then traitors avaunt! Vengeance to my aid! Let the false one come, approach, advance, die, yield up his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) life, and then befall what may.
<p/>Pure I came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) whom Heaven bestowed upon me, pure I shall leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>); and at the worst bathed in my own chaste blood and in the foul blood of the falsest friend that friendship ever saw in the world;''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla</b></font>)</div>and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) uttered these words she (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) paced the room holding the unsheathed dagger, with such irregular and disordered steps, and such gestures that one would have supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to have lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) senses, and taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) for some violent desperado instead of a delicate woman.
<p/>Anselmo, hidden behind some tapestries where he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had concealed himself, beheld and was amazed at all, and already felt that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had seen and heard was a sufficient answer to even greater suspicions; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would have been now well pleased if the proof afforded by Lothario's coming were dispensed with, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) feared some sudden mishap; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was on the point of showing himself and coming forth to embrace and undeceive his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) paused as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) saw Leonela returning, leading Lothario.
<p/>Camilla when she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), drawing a long line in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) on the floor with the dagger, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), ``Lothario, pay attention to what I say to thee: if by any chance thou darest to cross this line thou seest, or even approach it, the instant I see thee attempt it that same instant will I pierce my bosom with this dagger that I hold in my hand; and before thou answerest me a word desire thee to listen to a few from me, and afterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee.
<p/>First, I desire thee to tell me, Lothario, if thou knowest my husband Anselmo, and in what light thou regardest him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>); and secondly I desire to know if thou knowest me too.
<p/>Answer me this, without embarrassment or reflecting deeply what thou wilt answer, for they are no riddles I put to thee.
<p/>Lothario was not so dull but that from the first moment when Camilla directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) to make Anselmo hide himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) understood what she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) intended to do, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) fell in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) idea so readily and promptly that between them they made the imposture look more true than truth; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) thus: <div class="bookquote">``I did not think, fair Camilla, that thou wert calling me to ask questions so remote from the object with which I come; but if it is to defer the promised reward thou art doing so, thou mightst have put it off still longer, for the longing for happiness gives the more distress the nearer comes the hope of gaining it; but lest thou shouldst say that I do not answer thy questions, I say that I know thy husband Anselmo, and that we have known each other from our earliest years; I will not speak of what thou too knowest, of our friendship, that I may not compel myself to testify against the wrong that love, the mighty excuse for greater errors, makes me inflict upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>).
<p/>so I had not for a lesser prize acted in opposition to what I owe to my station and the holy laws of true friendship, now broken and violated by me through that powerful enemy, love.
<p/>If thou dost confess that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>returned Camilla, <div class="bookquote">``mortal enemy of all that rightly deserves to be loved, with what face dost thou dare to come before one whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) is reflected on whom thou shouldst look to see how unworthily thou him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>)?
<p/>But, woe is me, I now comprehend what has made thee give so little heed to what thou owest to thyself; it must have been some freedom of mine, for I will not call it immodesty, as it did not proceed from any deliberate intention, but from some heedlessness such as women are guilty of through inadvertence when they think they have no occasion for reserve.
<p/>But tell me, traitor, when did I by word or sign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken in thee a shadow of hope of attaining thy base wishes?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla</b></font>)</div>Thee I know and hold in the same estimation as he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) does, for were it not '' '' When were not thy professions of love sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked?
<p/>But as I am persuaded that no one can long persevere in the attempt to win love unsustained by some hope, I am willing to attribute to myself the blame of thy assurance, for no doubt some thoughtlessness of mine has all this time fostered thy hopes; and therefore will I punish myself and inflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt deserves.
<p/>When were thy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted? And that thou mayest see that being so relentless to myself
<p/>I cannot possibly be otherwise to thee, I have summoned thee to be a witness of the sacrifice I mean to offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband, wronged by thee with all the assiduity thou wert capable of, and by me too through want of caution in avoiding every occasion, if I have given any, of encouraging and sanctioning thy base designs.
<p/>Once more I say the suspicion in my mind that some imprudence of mine has engendered these lawless thoughts in thee, is what causes me most distress and what I desire most to punish with my own hands, for were any other instrument of punishment employed my error might become perhaps more widely known; but before I do so, in my death I mean to inflict death, and take with me one that will fully satisfy my longing for the revenge I hope for and have; for I shall see, wheresoever it may be that I go, the penalty awarded by inflexible, unswerving justice on him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) who has placed me in a position so desperate.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) uttered these words, with incredible energy and swiftness she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) flew upon Lothario with the naked dagger, so manifestly bent on burying it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) breast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was almost uncertain whether these demonstrations were real or feigned, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was obliged to have recourse to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) skill and strength to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) from striking him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>); and with such reality did she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) act this strange farce and mystification that, to give it a colour of truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) determined to stain it with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own blood; for perceiving, or pretending, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not wound Lothario, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Fate, it seems, will not grant my just desire complete satisfaction, but it will not be able to keep me from satisfying it partially at least;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and making an effort to free the hand with the dagger which Lothario held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) grasp, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) released it, and directing the point to a place where it could not inflict a deep wound, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) plunged it into her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) left side high up close to the shoulder, and then allowed herself to fall to the ground as if in a faint.
<p/>Leonela and Lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe, and seeing Camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) blood they were still uncertain as to the true nature of the act.
<p/>Lothario, terrified and breathless, ran in haste to pluck out the dagger; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) saw how slight the wound was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was relieved of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) fears and once more admired the subtlety, coolness, and ready wit of the fair Camilla; and the better to support the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had to play he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) began to utter profuse and doleful lamentations over her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) body as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) were dead, invoking maledictions not only on himself but also on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) who had been the means of placing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) in such a position: and knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) friend Anselmo heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) spoke in such a way as to make a listener feel much more pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) than for Camilla, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) dead.
<p/>Leonela took her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) arms and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) on the bed, entreating Lothario to go in quest of some one to attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) wound in secret, and at the same time asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) advice and opinion as to what they should say to Anselmo about his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) lady's wound if he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) should chance to return before it was healed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) replied they might say what they liked, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was not in a state to give advice that would be of any use; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was to try and stanch the blood, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was going where he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) should never more be seen; and with every appearance of deep grief and sorrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) left the house; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) found himself alone, and where there was nobody to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) crossed himself unceasingly, lost in wonder at the adroitness of Camilla and the consistent acting of Leonela.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) reflected how convinced Anselmo would be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had a second Portia for a wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) looked forward anxiously to meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) in order to rejoice together over falsehood and truth the most craftily veiled that could be imagined.
<p/>Leonela, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>), stanched her (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) lady's blood, which was no more than sufficed to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) deception; and washing the wound with a little wine she (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) bound it up to the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) skill, talking all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) was tending her (<font color='blue'><b>Portia</b></font>) in a strain that, even if nothing else had been said before, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had in Camilla a model of purity.
<p/>To Leonela's words Camilla added her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) own, calling herself cowardly and wanting in spirit, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had not enough at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had most need of it to rid herself of the life she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) so much loathed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) attendant's advice as to whether or not she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) ought to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) beloved husband of all that had happened, but the other bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) say nothing about it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would lay upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the obligation of taking vengeance on Lothario, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) could not do but at great risk to himself; and it was the duty of a true wife not to give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband provocation to quarrel, but, on the contrary, to remove it as far as possible from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Camilla replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was right and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) advice, but at any rate it would be well to consider how she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was to explain the wound to Anselmo, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) could not help seeing it; to which Leonela answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) did not know how to tell a lie even in jest.
<p/>How then can I know, my dear?'' said Camilla, ``for I should not dare to forge or keep up a falsehood if my life depended on it.
<p/>If we can think of no escape from this difficulty, it will be better to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) the plain truth than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) should find us out in an untrue story.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be not uneasy, senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div>said Leonela; <div class="bookquote">``between this and to-morrow I will think of what we must say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), and perhaps the wound being where it is it can be hidden from his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) sight, and Heaven will be pleased to aid us in a purpose so good and honourable.
<p/>Compose yourself, senora, and endeavour to calm your excitement lest my lord find you agitated; and leave the rest to my care and God's, who always supports good intentions.
<p/>Anselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out the tragedy of the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) honour, which the performers acted with such wonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had become the realities of the parts they played.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) longed for night and an opportunity of escaping from the house to go and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) good friend Lothario, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) give vent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) joy over the precious pearl he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had gained in having established his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) wife's purity.
<p/>Both mistress and maid took care to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) time and opportunity to get away, and taking advantage of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) escape, and at once went in quest of Lothario, and it would be impossible to describe how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), and the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) in the joy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) heart, and the praises he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) bestowed upon Camilla; all which Lothario listened to without being able to show any pleasure, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) could not forget how deceived his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) friend was, and how dishonourably he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>); and though Anselmo could see that Lothario was not glad, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) imagined it was only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had left Camilla wounded and had been himself the cause of it; and so among other things he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) not to be distressed about Camilla's accident, for, as they had agreed to hide it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), the wound was evidently trifling; and that being so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) had no cause for fear, but should henceforward be of good cheer and rejoice with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>), seeing that by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) means and adroitness he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) found himself raised to the greatest height of happiness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) could have ventured to hope for, and desired no better pastime than making verses in praise of Camilla that would preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) name for all time to come.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Lothario commended his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) purpose, and promised on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) own part to aid him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) in raising a monument so glorious.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) himself, persuaded he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was conducting the instrument of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) glory, led home by the hand of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) who had been the utter destruction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) good name; whom Camilla received with averted countenance, though with smiles in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) heart.
<p/>The deception was carried on for some time, until at the end of a few months Fortune turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) wheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) life the penalty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) ill-advised curiosity.
<p/>And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be in the world. CHAPTER XXXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE
<p/>There remained but little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho Panza burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixote was lying, shouting,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in the thick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on.
<p/>By the living God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the Princess Micomicona, such a slash that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has sliced his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head clean off as if it were a turnip.
<p/>What are you talking about, brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the curate, pausing as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was about to read the remainder of the novel.
<p/>HAD WITH CERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS THE NOVEL OF <div class="bookquote">``THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>TO A CLOSE '' '' ''
<p/>Are you in your senses, Sancho? How the devil can it be as you say, when the giant is two thousand leagues away?
<p/>Here they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shouting out, <div class="bookquote">``Stand, thief, brigand, villain; now I have got thee, and thy scimitar shall not avail thee!
<p/>Don't stop to listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but go in and part them or help my master: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giant is dead by this time and giving account to God of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) past wicked life; for I saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and fallen on one side, and it is as big as a large wine-skin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I die,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the landlord at this, <div class="bookquote">``if Don Quixote or Don Devil has not been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bed's head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes for blood;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went into the room and the rest after him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and there they found Don Quixote in the strangest costume in the world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thighs completely and was six fingers shorter behind; his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) legs were very long and lean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) left arm
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for reasons best known to himself, owed a grudge, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) right hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) unsheathed sword, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was slashing about on all sides, uttering exclamations as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) were actually fighting some giant: and
<p/>'' '' And then it seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) were slashing vigorously at the wall. '' the best of it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes were not open, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was fast asleep, and
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) imagination was so wrought upon by the adventure he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was going to accomplish, that it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) dream he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had already reached the kingdom of Micomicon, and was engaged in combat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) enemy; and believing he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was laying on the giant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had given so many sword cuts to the skins that the whole room was full of wine.
<p/>On seeing this the landlord was so enraged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fell on Don Quixote, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) clenched fist began to pummel him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in such a way, that if Cardenio and the curate had not dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have brought the war of the giant to an end.
<p/>But in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke until the barber brought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung it with one dash all over his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) body, on which Don Quixote woke up, but not so completely as to understand what was the matter.
<p/>Dorothea, seeing how short and slight his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) attire was, would not go in to witness the battle between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) champion and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) opponent.
<p/>As for Sancho, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went searching all over the floor for the head of the giant, and not finding it he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I see now that it's all enchantment in this house; for the last time, on this very spot where I am now, I got ever so many thumps without knowing who gave them to me, or being able to see anybody; and now this head is not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut off with my own eyes and the blood running from the body as if from a fountain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>dreaming that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was doing battle with the giant. <div class="bookquote">``What blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saints?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord.
<p/>Don't you see, you thief, that the blood and the fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and the red wine swimming all over the room?--and
<p/>'' I wish I saw the soul of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that stabbed them swimming in hell. '' <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``all I know is it will be my bad luck that through not finding this head my county will melt away like salt in water;'' (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>--for
<p/>The landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and the mischievous doings of the master, and swore it should not be like the last time when they went without paying; and that their privileges of chivalry should not hold good this time to let one or other of them off without paying, even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be put to the damaged wine-skins.
<p/>The curate was holding Don Quixote's hands, who, fancying he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of the Princess Micomicona, knelt before the curate and said, <div class="bookquote">``Exalted and beauteous lady, your highness may live from this day forth fearless of any harm this base being could do you; and I too from this day forth am released from the promise I gave you, since by the help of God on high and by the favour of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by whom I live and breathe, I have fulfilled it so successfully.
<p/>Sancho awake was worse than his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master asleep, so much had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's promises addled his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wits. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did not I say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho on hearing this.
<p/>You see I wasn't drunk; there you see my master has already salted the giant; there's no doubt about the bulls; my county is all right!
<p/>And laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed himself; but at length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrived with no small trouble to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fell asleep with every appearance of excessive weariness.
<p/>They left him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to sleep, and came out to the gate of the inn to console Sancho Panza on not having found the head of the giant; but much more work had they to appease the landlord, who was furious at the sudden death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) wine-skins; and said the landlady half scolding, half crying, <div class="bookquote">``At an evil moment and in an unlucky hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) came into my house,
<p/>this knight-errant--would that I had never set eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), for dear he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) has cost me; the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) went off with the overnight score against him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) for supper, bed, straw, and barley, for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) squire and a hack and an ass, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was a knight adventurer--God send unlucky adventures to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and all the adventurers in the world--and therefore not bound to pay anything, for it was so settled by the knight-errantry tariff: and then, all because of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), came the other gentleman and carried off my tail, and gives it back more than two cuartillos the worse, all stripped of its hair, so that it is no use for my husband's purpose; and then, for a finishing touch to all, to burst my wine-skins and spill my wine!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the giant</b></font>)</div>'' Who could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master and man? I wish I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own blood spilt!
<p/>But let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) not deceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and the shade of my mother, they shall pay me down every quarts; or my name is not what it is, and I am not my father's daughter.
<p/>'' All this and more to the same effect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) good maid Maritornes backed her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) up, while the daughter held her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) peace and smiled from time to time.
<p/>The curate smoothed matters by promising to make good all losses to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) power, not only as regarded the wine-skins but also the wine, and above all the depreciation of the tail which they set such store by.
<p/>Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pledged herself, as soon as it should appear certain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master had decapitated the giant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) found herself peacefully established in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) kingdom, to bestow upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the best county there was in it.
<p/>With this Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princess she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) might rely upon it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had seen the head of the giant, and more by token it had a beard that reached to the girdle, and that if it was not to be seen now it was because everything that happened in that house went by enchantment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) himself had proved the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had lodged there.
<p/>Dorothea said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fully believed it, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) need not be uneasy, for all would go well and turn out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wished.
<p/>All therefore being appeased, the curate was anxious to go on with the novel, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw there was but little more left to read.
<p/>Dorothea and the others begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to finish it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was willing to please them, and enjoyed reading it himself, continued the tale in these words:
<p/>The result was, that from the confidence Anselmo felt in Camilla's virtue, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) lived happy and free from anxiety, and Camilla purposely looked coldly on Lothario, that Anselmo might suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) feelings towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to be the opposite of what they were; and the better to support the position, Lothario begged to be excused from coming to the house, as the displeasure with which Camilla regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) presence was plain to be seen.
<p/>But the befooled Anselmo said he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would on no account allow such a thing, and so in a thousand ways he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) became the author of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) own dishonour, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was insuring his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) happiness.
<p/>Meanwhile the satisfaction with which Leonela saw herself empowered to carry on her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) amour reached such a height that, regardless of everything else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) inclinations unrestrainedly, feeling confident that her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) mistress would screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), and even show her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) how to manage it safely.
<p/>At last one night Anselmo heard footsteps in Leonela's room, and on trying to enter to see who it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) found that the door was held against him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) all the more determined to open it; and exerting his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) strength he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) forced it open, and entered the room in time to see a man leaping through the window into the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) ran quickly to seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) or discover who he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was unable to effect either purpose, for Leonela flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) crying, ``Be calm, senor; do not give way to passion or follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) who has escaped from this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) belongs to me, and in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) is my husband.
<p/>Anselmo would not believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger and threatened to stab Leonela, bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) tell the truth or he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) would kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) fear, not knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was saying, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Do not kill me, senor, for I can tell you things more important than any you can imagine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It would be impossible for me now,'' said Leonela, <div class="bookquote">``I am so agitated: leave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fill you with astonishment; but rest assured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) who leaped through the window is a young man of this city, who has given me his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) promise to become my husband.
<p/>Anselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) never expected to hear anything against Camilla, so satisfied and sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) virtue was he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>); and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) quitted the room, and left Leonela locked in, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) should not come out until she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) all she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had to make known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) went at once to see Camilla, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) did, all that had passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) handmaid, and the promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) matters of serious importance.
<p/>There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for so great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had good reason to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) knew of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) faithlessness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had not the courage to wait and see if her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) suspicions were confirmed; and that same night, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) thought that Anselmo was asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) packed up the most valuable jewels she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had and some money, and without being observed by anybody escaped from the house and betook herself to Lothario's, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) related what had occurred, imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) to convey her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to some place of safety or fly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) where they might be safe from Anselmo.
<p/>The state of perplexity to which Camilla reduced Lothario was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was unable to utter a word in reply, still less to decide upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) should do.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) resolved to conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to a convent of which a sister of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) was prioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with the speed which the circumstances demanded, Lothario took her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to the convent and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) there, and then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lothario</b></font>) departure.
<p/>As soon as daylight came Anselmo, without missing Camilla from his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) side, rose eager to learn what Leonela had to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), and hastened to the room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had locked her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) opened the door, entered, but found no Leonela; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) found was some sheets knotted to the window, a plain proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had let herself down from it and escaped.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) returned, uneasy, to tell Camilla, but not finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) in bed or anywhere in the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was lost in amazement.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonela</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell me then at once or thou diest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anselmo</b></font>)</div>said Anselmo. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) asked the servants of the house about her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), but none of them could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) any explanation.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was going in search of Camilla it happened by chance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) boxes were lying open, and that the greater part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) jewels were gone; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) became fully aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) disgrace, and that Leonela was not the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) misfortune; and, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was, without delaying to dress himself completely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) repaired, sad at heart and dejected, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) friend Lothario to make known his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) sorrow to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>); but
<p/>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) failed to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) and the servants reported that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had been absent from his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) house all night and had taken with him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) all the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) were losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) senses; and to make all complete on returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) own house he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) found it deserted and empty, not one of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) servants, male or female, remaining in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) knew not what to think, or say, or do, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) reason seemed to be deserting him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) little by little.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) reviewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) position, and saw himself in a moment left without wife, friend, or servants, abandoned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) felt, by the heaven above him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), and more than all robbed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) honour, for in Camilla's disappearance he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) own ruin.
<p/>After long reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) resolved at last to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) friend's village, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had been staying when he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) afforded opportunities for the contrivance of this complication of misfortune.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) locked the doors of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) house, mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) horse, and with a broken spirit set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) journey; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had hardly gone half-way when, harassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) reflections, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had to dismount and tie his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) horse to a tree, at the foot of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) threw himself, giving vent to piteous heartrending sighs; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) remained till nearly nightfall, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) observed a man approaching on horseback from the city, of whom, after saluting him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) asked what was the news in Florence.
<p/>The citizen replied, <div class="bookquote">``The strangest that have been heard for many a day; for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the wealthy Anselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last night Camilla, the wife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared.
<p/>All this has been told by a maid-servant of Camilla's, whom the governor found last night lowering herself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo's house.
<p/>I know not indeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I know is that the whole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no one could have expected a thing of the kind, seeing the great and intimate friendship that existed between them, so great, they say, that they were called `The Two Friends.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>The citizen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it known at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anselmo</b></font>)</div>said Anselmo, <div class="bookquote">``what road Lothario and Camilla took? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Anselmo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>the citizen</b></font>)</div>said the citizen, <div class="bookquote">``though the governor has been very active in searching for them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the citizen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God speed you, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anselmo</b></font>)</div>said Anselmo. '' God be with you,'' said the citizen and went his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) way. This disastrous intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) senses but of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) got up as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was able and reached the house of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) friend, who as yet knew nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) misfortune, but seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) come pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was suffering some heavy affliction.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) wish was complied with and he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was left lying down and alone, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) desired this, and even that the door should be locked.
<p/>Finding himself alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) so took to heart the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) misfortune that by the signs of death he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) felt within him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>)
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) knew well his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) life was drawing to a close, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) resolved to leave behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) a declaration of the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) strange end.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) began to write, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had put down all he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) meant to say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) breath failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) yielded up his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) life, a victim to the suffering which his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) ill-advised curiosity had entailed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>).
<p/>The master of the house observing that it was now late and that Anselmo did not call, determined to go in and ascertain if his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) indisposition was increasing, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) body partly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) lay with the written paper open and the pen still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Having first called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) without receiving any answer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) host approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) was dead.
<p/>Greatly surprised and distressed he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) summoned the household to witness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) read the paper, the handwriting of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) recognised as his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), and which contained these words: <div class="bookquote">``A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life.
<p/>If the news of my death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) know that I forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to have required her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) to perform them; and since I have been the author of my own dishonour, there is no reason why-
<p/>So far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) could finish what he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) had to say, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) life came to an end.
<p/>The next day his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) friend sent intelligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) death to his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) relatives, who had already ascertained his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) misfortune, as well as the convent where Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) husband on that inevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) death, but because of those she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) received of her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) lover's departure.
<p/>Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) saw herself a widow, it is said she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) refused either to quit the convent or take the veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) that Lothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de Lautrec had been recently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova in the kingdom of Naples, whither her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) too late repentant lover had repaired.
<p/>Anselmo at once begged to be allowed to retire to rest, and to be given writing materials. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>On learning this Camilla took the veil, and shortly afterwards died, worn out by grief and melancholy.
<p/>I like this novel,'' said the curate; <div class="bookquote">``but I cannot persuade myself of its truth; and if it has been invented, the author's invention is faulty, for it is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as to try such a costly experiment as Anselmo's.
<p/>If it had been represented as occurring between a gallant and his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) mistress it might pass; but between husband and wife there is something of an impossibility about it.
<p/>This was the end of all three, an end that came of a thoughtless beginning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>As to the way in which the story is told, however, I have no fault to find.
<p/>'' CHAPTER XXXVI. WHICH TREATS OF MORE CURIOUS INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED AT THE INN Just at that instant the landlord, who was standing at the gate of the inn, exclaimed,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes a fine troop of guests; if they stop here we may say gaudeamus. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What are they?'' said Cardenio.
<p/>Four men,'' said the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``riding a la jineta, with lances and bucklers, and all with black veils, and with them there is a woman in white on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two attendants on foot.
<p/>Hearing this Dorothea covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face, and Cardenio retreated into Don Quixote's room, and they hardly had time to do so before the whole party the host had described entered the inn, and the four that were on horseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted, and came forward to take down the woman who rode on the side-saddle, and one of them taking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arms placed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a chair that stood at the entrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself.
<p/>All this time neither she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word, only on sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms fall like one that was ill and weak.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Are they very near?''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate. '' So near,'' answered the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``that here they come. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The attendants</b></font>)</div>The attendants on foot then led the horses away to the stable.
<p/>Observing this the curate, curious to know who these people in such a dress and preserving such silence were, went to where the servants were standing and put the question to one of them, who answered him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).
<p/>Faith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to be people of distinction, particularly he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) who advanced to take the lady you saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) arms; and I say so because all the rest show him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) respect, and nothing is done except what he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) directs and orders.''
<p/>That I cannot tell you either,'' said the servant, <div class="bookquote">``for I have not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face all the way: I have indeed heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sigh many times and utter such groans that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seems to be giving up the ghost every time; but it is no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as my comrade
<p/>and I have only been in their company two days, for having met us on the road they begged and persuaded us to accompany them to Andalusia, promising to pay us well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' And the lady, who is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?'' asked the curate. '' '' And have you heard any of them called by his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) name?'' asked the curate.
<p/>No, indeed,'' replied the servant; <div class="bookquote">``they all preserve a marvellous silence on the road, for not a sound is to be heard among them except the poor lady's sighs and sobs, which make us pity her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and we feel sure that wherever it is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is going, it is against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will, and as far as one can judge from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a nun or, what is more likely, about to become one; and perhaps it is because taking the vows is not of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own free will, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is so unhappy as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seems to be.
<p/>That may well be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>said the curate, and leaving them he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) returned to where Dorothea was, who, hearing the veiled lady sigh, moved by natural compassion drew near to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and said, ``What are you suffering from, senora?
<p/>If it be anything that women are accustomed and know how to relieve, I offer you my services with all my heart.
<p/>To this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) offers more earnestly she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) still kept silence, until the gentleman with the veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest, approached and said to Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``Do not give yourself the trouble, senora, of making any offers to that woman, for it is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way to give no thanks for anything that is done for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and do not try to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answer unless you want to hear some lie from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never told a lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was the immediate reply of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who had been silent until now; ``on the contrary, it is because I am so truthful and so ignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition; and this I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth that has made you false and a liar.
<p/>Cardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close to the speaker, for there was only the door of Don Quixote's room between them, and the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did so, uttering a loud exclamation he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Good God!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Startled at the voice the lady turned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head; and not seeing the speaker she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood up and attempted to enter the room; observing which the gentleman held her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back, preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from moving a step.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) agitation and sudden movement the silk with which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had covered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable and marvellous beauty, but pale and terrified; for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kept turning her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, everywhere she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could direct her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gaze, with an eagerness that made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) senses, and so marked that it excited the pity of Dorothea and all who beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), though they knew not what caused it.
<p/>The gentleman grasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully occupied with holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) back, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was unable to put a hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who was holding the lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) arms, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) who likewise held her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, Don Fernando.
<p/>The instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fell backwards fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have fallen completely to the ground.
<p/>The curate at once hastened to uncover her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face and throw water on it, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) did so Don Fernando, for he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) it was who held the other in his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) arms, recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) grasp of Luscinda, for it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) that was struggling to release herself from his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) hold, having recognised Cardenio by his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) had recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>).
<p/>Cardenio also heard Dorothea's cry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fell fainting, and imagining that it came from his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) Luscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) arms.
<p/>Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them.
<p/>They gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, Don Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio.
<p/>'' '' '' '' '' what is this I hear? What voice is this that has reached my ears? The first to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressed Don Fernando:
<p/>``Leave me, Senor Don Fernando, for the sake of what you owe to yourself; if no other reason will induce you, leave me to cling to the wall of which I am the ivy, to the support from which neither your importunities, nor your threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts have been able to detach me.
<p/>See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden from our sight, has brought me face to face with my true husband; and well you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be able to efface him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) from my memory.
<p/>May this plain declaration, then, lead you, as you can do nothing else, to turn your love into rage, your affection into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it up in the presence of my beloved husband
<p/>it well bestowed; it may be by my death he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will be convinced that I kept my faith to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to the last moment of life.
<p/>Meanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda's words, by means of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) divined who she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was; but seeing that Don Fernando did not yet release her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) or reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), summoning up her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) resolution as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) could she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) rose and knelt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) feet, and with a flood of bright and touching tears addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) thus: ``If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine arms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen by this time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt have it so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea.
<p/>I am that lowly peasant girl whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst raise high enough to call herself thine; I am she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who in the seclusion of innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thy importunity, and thy true and tender passion, as it seemed, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) opened the gates of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liberty; a gift received by thee but thanklessly, as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place where thou dost find me, and by thy appearance under the circumstances in which I see thee.
<p/>Nevertheless, I would not have thee suppose that I have come here driven by my shame; it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by thee that have led me.
<p/>It was thy will to make me thine, and thou didst so follow thy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou canst not help being mine.
<p/>Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable affection I bear thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou wouldst desert me.
<p/>Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda's because thou art mine, nor can she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) be thine because she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) is Cardenio's; and it will be easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee, than to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now.
<p/>Thou didst address thyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wert not ignorant of my station,
<p/>well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to thy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and if it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a gentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy at last as thou didst at first?
<p/>And if thou wilt not have me for what I am, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave, for so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate.
<p/>Do not by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the streets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal services they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not deserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy blood to mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or no nobility in the world that has not travelled the same road, and that in illustrious lineages it is not the woman's blood that is of account; and, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if thou art wanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou owest me, then even I have higher claims to nobility than thine.
<p/>whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thy wife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to be false, if thou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me; witness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, which thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and if all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its silent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of what I say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment.
<p/>All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest feeling and such tears that all present, even those who came with Don Fernando, were constrained to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in them.
<p/>Don Fernando listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) gave way to such sobs and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not softened by the sight of so great sorrow.
<p/>Luscinda stood regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) with no less compassion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) sufferings than admiration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) intelligence and beauty, and would have gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) to say some words of comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), but was prevented by Don Fernando's grasp which held her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) fast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment, after regarding Dorothea for some moments with a fixed gaze, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) arms, and, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed: ``Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is impossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many truths.
<p/>Luscinda in her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground when Don Fernando released her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), but Cardenio, who stood near, having retreated behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside and regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), and said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) arms, ``If Heaven in its compassion is willing to let thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant, and fair, nowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that now receive thee, and received thee before when fortune permitted me to call thee mine.
<p/>At these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) voice and then satisfying herself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) eyes that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), and hardly knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) did, and heedless of all considerations of decorum, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) arms around his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) neck and pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) face close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), said, ``Yes, my dear lord, you are the true master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose again, and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.
<p/>A strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around, filled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for.
<p/>Dorothea fancied that Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) meant to take vengeance on Cardenio, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) sword; and the instant the idea struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
<p/>with wonderful quickness she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) round the knees, and kissing them and holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) so as to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) moving, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tears continued to flow, <div class="bookquote">``What is it thou wouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event?
<p/>Thou hast thy wife at thy feet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whom thou wouldst have for thy wife is in the arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband: reflect whether it will be right for thee, whether it will be possible for thee to undo what Heaven has done, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be thy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) truth and constancy, is before thine eyes, bathing with the tears of love the face and bosom of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lawful husband.
<p/>I count ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>To make an end, senor, these are my last words to thee: '' '' '' '' For God's sake I entreat of thee, for thine own I implore thee
<p/>, let not this open manifestation rouse thy anger; but rather so calm it as to allow these two lovers to live in peace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as Heaven permits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of thy lofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that with thee reason has more influence than passion.
<p/>All the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) held Luscinda in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arms, never took his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist as best he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could all who might assail him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), though it should cost him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life.
<p/>But now Don Fernando's friends, as well as the curate and the barber, who had been present all the while, not forgetting the worthy Sancho Panza, ran forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) to have regard for the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) reasonable hopes to be disappointed, since, as they firmly believed, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said was but the truth; and bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) observe that it was not, as it might seem, by accident, but by a special disposition of Providence that they had all met in a place where no one could have expected a meeting.
<p/>that even if some sword were to separate them they would think their death most happy; and that in a case that admitted of no remedy his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) wisest course was, by conquering and putting a constraint upon himself, to show a generous mind, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) own accord suffer these two to enjoy the happiness Heaven had granted them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), too, turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) eyes upon the beauty of Dorothea and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) would see that few if any could equal much less excel her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); while to that beauty should be added her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) modesty and the surpassing love she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>).
<p/>But besides all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could not do otherwise than keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) plighted word; and that in doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would obey God and meet the approval of all sensible people, who know and recognised it to be the privilege of beauty, even in one of humble birth, provided virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself to the level of any rank, without any slur upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) who places it upon an equality with himself; and furthermore that when the potent sway of passion asserts itself, so long as there be no mixture of sin in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is not to be blamed who gives way to it.
<p/>To be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don Fernando's manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, was touched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) wished it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) could not gainsay; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) submission, and acceptance of the good advice that had been offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), by stooping down and embracing Dorothea, saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Rise, dear lady, it is not right that what I hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if until now I have shown no sign of what I own, it may have been by Heaven's decree in order that, seeing the constancy with which you love me, I may learn to value you as you deserve.
<p/>What I entreat of you is that you reproach me not with my transgression and grievous wrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make you mine impelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this, turn and look at the eyes of the now happy Luscinda, and you will see in them an excuse for all my errors: and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) has found and gained the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) desires, and I have found in you what satisfies all my wishes, may she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) live in peace and contentment as many happy years with her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) Cardenio, as on my knees
<p/>I pray Heaven to allow me to live with my Dorothea;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and with these words he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) once more embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) face to hers with so much tenderness that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had to take great heed to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) tears from completing the proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) love and repentance in the sight of all.
<p/>Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and almost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own happiness, some at that of the others
<p/>'' And the curate bade him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) remember that only death could part Luscinda from Cardenio; , that one would have supposed a heavy calamity had fallen upon them all.
<p/>Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) only wept because he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) saw that Dorothea was not as he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) expected such great favours.
<p/>Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) thanks for the favour he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had rendered them in language so grateful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) then asked Dorothea how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had managed to reach a place so far removed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in a few fitting words told all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) misadventures.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) in the city after he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had found in Luscinda's bosom the paper in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was Cardenio's wife, and never could be his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>).
<p/>had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) not been prevented by her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) parents, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer.
<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) learned that Luscinda had disappeared from her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) father's house, and that no one could tell whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) had gone.
<p/>Finally, at the end of some months he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) ascertained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was in a convent and meant to remain there all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) life, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) were not to share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had learned this, taking these three gentlemen as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) companions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) arrived at the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was, but avoided speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), fearing that if it were known he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent; and watching a time when the porter's lodge was open he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) left two to guard the gate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) and the other entered the convent in quest of Luscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of the nuns, and carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) off without giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) time to resist, they reached a place with her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) where they provided themselves with what they required for taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) away; all which they were able to do in complete safety, as the convent was in the country at a considerable distance from the city.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) added that when Luscinda found herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) power she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) lost all consciousness, and after returning to herself did nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in silence and tears
<p/>they reached that inn, which for him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was reaching heaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) meant to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), and would have done so CHAPTER XXXVII. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA,
<p/>listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how the fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into Don Fernando, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious of all that had come to pass.
<p/>Dorothea was unable to persuade herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar state of mind, and Luscinda's thoughts ran in the same direction.
<p/>Don Fernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had been brought so near the destruction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) good name and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business.
<p/>The curate as a sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour was the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had given her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) to pay for all the losses and damage she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had sustained through Don Quixote's means.
<p/>Sancho, as has been already said, was the only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long face he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went in to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, who had just awoke, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>): ``Sir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as you like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for I have had the most prodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember having had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke-swish!--I brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth from him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like red wine, your worship had better say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for I would have you know, if you don't know it, that the dead giant is a hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and the devil take it all.
<p/>WITH OTHER DROLL ADVENTURES To all this Sancho ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' What art thou talking about, fool? '' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``art thou in thy senses?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let your worship get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``and you will see the nice business you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see the queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things that will astonish you, if you understand them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote; ``for if thou dost remember the last time we were here
<p/>I told thee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it would be no wonder if it were the same now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could believe all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``if my blanketing was the same sort of thing also; only it wasn't, but real and genuine; for I saw the landlord, Who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no enchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, well, God will give a remedy,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``hand me my clothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and things thou speakest of.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Sancho fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) clothes; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was dressing, the curate gave Don Fernando and the others
<p/>present an account of Don Quixote's madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) from that Pena Pobre where he (<font color='blue'><b>Pobre</b></font>) fancied himself stationed because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pobre</b></font>) lady's scorn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pobre</b></font>) described to them also nearly all the adventures that Sancho had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little, thinking it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be capable of.
<p/>But now, the curate said, that the lady Dorothea's good fortune prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) from proceeding with their purpose, it would be necessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) home.
<p/>Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested that Luscinda would act and support Dorothea's part sufficiently well.
<p/>No,'' said Don Fernando, <div class="bookquote">``that must not be, for I want Dorothea to follow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman's village is not very far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) relief.
<p/>Even if it were more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Fernando/Fernando/Senor Don Fernando</b></font>)</div>said Don Fernando, ``I would gladly travel so far for the sake of doing so good a work.
<p/>At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino's helmet, all dinted as it was, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm, and leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) staff or pike.
<p/>The strange figure he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) presented filled Don Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) lean yellow face half a league long, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) deportment.
<p/>They stood silent waiting to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) would say, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) eyes on the fair Dorothea, addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with great gravity and composure: <div class="bookquote">``I am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has been annihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady of high degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a private maiden.
<p/>If this has been done by the command of the magician king your father, through fear that I should not afford you the aid you need and are entitled to, I may tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know and does not know half the mass, and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had read and gone through them as attentively and deliberately as I have, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have found at every turn that knights of less renown than mine have accomplished things more difficult: it is no great matter to kill a whelp of a giant, however arrogant he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may be; for it is not many hours since I myself was engaged with one, and-I will not speak of it, that they may not say I am lying; time, however, that reveals all, will tell the tale when we least expect it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Fernando/Fernando/Senor Don Fernando</b></font>)</div>said the landlord at this; but Don Fernando told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) tongue and on no account interrupt Don Quixote, who continued, ``I say in conclusion, high and disinherited lady, that if your father has brought about this metamorphosis in your person for the reason I have mentioned, you ought not to attach any importance to it; for there is no peril on earth through which my sword will not force a way, and with it, before many days are over, I will bring your enemy's head to the ground and place on yours the crown of your kingdom.
<p/>Don Quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princess, who aware of Don Fernando's determination to carry on the deception until Don Quixote had been conveyed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) home, with great ease of manner and gravity made answer, ``Whoever told you, valiant Knight of the Rueful Countenance, that I had undergone any change or transformation did not tell you the truth, for I am the same as I was yesterday.
<p/>It is true that certain strokes of good fortune, that have given me more than I could have hoped for, have made some alteration in me; but I have not therefore ceased to be what I was before, or to entertain the same desire I have had all through of availing myself of the might of your valiant and invincible arm.
<p/>And so, senor, let your goodness reinstate the father that begot me in your good opinion, and be assured that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a wise and prudent man, since by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) craft he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found out such a sure and easy way of remedying my misfortune; for I believe, senor, that had it not been for you
<p/>I should never have lit upon the good fortune I now possess; and in this I am saying what is perfectly true; as most of these gentlemen who are present can fully testify.
<p/>All that remains is to set out on our journey to-morrow, for to-day we could not make much way; and for the rest of the happy result I am looking forward to, I trust to God and the valour of your heart.
<p/>So said the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) Don Quixote turned to Sancho, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), with an angry air, <div class="bookquote">``I declare now, little Sancho, thou art the greatest little villain in Spain.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``It is not more than two days' journey from this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate. '' '' '' '' Say, thief and vagabond, hast thou

<p/>Many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed between Don Quixote and Don Fernando; but they were brought to an end by a traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) attire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors, for he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with half-sleeves and without a collar; his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) breeches were also of blue cloth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) cap of the same colour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) wore yellow buskins and had a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) breast.
<p/>Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>), mounted upon an ass, there came a woman dressed in Moorish fashion, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face veiled and a scarf on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, and wearing a little brocaded cap, and a mantle that covered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulders to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet.
<p/>The man was of a robust and well-proportioned frame, in age a little over forty, rather swarthy in complexion, with long moustaches and a full beard, and, in short, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance was such that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been well dressed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been taken for a person of quality and good birth.

<p/>Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) daughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirely new costume, gathered round her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); and Dorothea, who was always kindly, courteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and the man who had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Do not be put out, senora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here, for it is the way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you will be pleased to share our lodging with us -LRB-pointing to Luscinda-RRB- perhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your journey.
<p/>To this the veiled lady made no reply; all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did was to rise from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seat, crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bosom, bowing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head and bending her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) body as a sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) returned thanks.

<p/>At this moment the captive came up, having been until now otherwise engaged, and seeing that they all stood round his (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) companion and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made no reply to what they addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Ladies, this damsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but that of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) own country, for which reason she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) does not and cannot answer what has been asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There has been no opportunity for that,'' replied the captive, ``since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) left Algiers, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) native country and home; and up to the present she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) has not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to make it necessary to baptise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) has been instructed in all the ceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere long she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) which is higher than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dress or mine indicates.
<p/>By these words he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) excited a desire in all who heard him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), to know who the Moorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just then, seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest themselves than for questioning them about their lives.
<p/>Dorothea took the Moorish lady by the hand and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to a seat beside herself, requested her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) veil.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) has not been baptised?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luscinda/Lady Luscinda</b></font>)</div>returned Luscinda. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) looked at the captive as if to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) what they meant and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) was to do.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) in Arabic that they asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) to take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) veil, and thereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) removed it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) seemed more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful than Dorothea, and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it was the Moorish lady's, and there were even those who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference.
<p/>And as it is the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and secure good-will, all forthwith became eager to show kindness and attention to the lovely Moor.
<p/>Don Fernando asked the captive what her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) replied that it was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Lela</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lela</b></font>) guessed what the Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and energy, <div class="bookquote">``No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!''

<p/>These words, and the touching earnestness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) uttered them, drew more than one tear from some of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature tender-hearted and compassionate.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Luscinda embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) affectionately, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, Maria, Maria,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luscinda/Lady Luscinda</b></font>)</div>to which the Moor replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, Maria; Zoraida macange,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Moor</b></font>)</div>which means ``not Zoraida.
<p/>Night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied Don Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the best supper that was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) power.
<p/>The hour therefore having arrived they all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one, for round or square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of honour at the head of it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was for refusing it, they assigned to Don Quixote, who desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) side, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) protector.
<p/>Luscinda and Zoraida took their places next her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), opposite to them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the captive and the other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the curate and the barber.
<p/>And so they supped in high enjoyment, which was increased when they observed Don Quixote leave off eating, and, moved by an impulse like that which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) deliver himself at such length when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) supped with the goatherds, begin to address them:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the things they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry.
<p/>Say, what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this castle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or imagine us to be what we are?
<p/>Who would say that this lady who is beside me was the great queen that we all know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to be, or that I am that Knight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of Fame?
<p/>Now, there can be no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the more deserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril.
<p/>Away with those who assert that letters have the preeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that they know not what they say.
<p/>For the reason which such persons commonly assign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the labours of the mind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give employment to the body alone; as if the calling were a porter's trade, for which nothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we who profess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for the execution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of the warrior, when he (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) has an army, or the defence of a city under his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) care, did not exert itself as much by mind as by body.
<p/>Nay; see whether by bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of the enemy, his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off impending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them the body has no share whatever.
<p/>Since, therefore, arms have need of the mind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two minds
<p/>, that of the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object.
<p/>The end and goal of letters--I am not speaking now of divine letters, the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end
<p/>the end of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every man that which is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and see and take care that good laws are observed: an end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not such as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their end and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this life.
<p/>The first good news the world and mankind received was that which the angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in the air, `Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of good-will;' and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and earth taught his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) disciples and chosen followers when they entered any house, was to say, `Peace be on this house;' and many other times he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) said to them, `My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace be with you;' a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand: a jewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in heaven.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>so infinite no other can be compared--I speak of human letters, This peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name for arms.
<p/>This, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, and that so far it has the advantage of the end of letters, let us turn to the bodily labours of the man of letters, and those of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who follows the profession of arms, and see which are the greater.
<p/>Don Quixote delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) discourse in such a manner and in such correct language, that for the time being he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made it impossible for any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hearers to consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a madman; on the contrary, as they were mostly gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with great pleasure as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) continued: ``Here, then, I say is what the student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all are poor, but to put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) endures poverty, I think nothing more need be said about his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) hard fortune, for he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) who is poor has no share of the good things of life.
<p/>This poverty he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or nakedness, or all together; but for all that it is not so extreme but that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) gets something to eat, though it may be at somewhat unseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the greatest misery of the student is what they themselves call `going out for soup,' and there is always some neighbour's brazier or hearth for them, which, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them, and lastly, they sleep comfortably at night under a roof.
<p/>I will not go into other particulars, as for example want of shirts, and no superabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorging themselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck has treated them to a banquet of some sort.
<p/>By this road that I have described, rough and hard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up again to fall again, they reach the rank they desire, and that once attained, we have seen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and Charybdises, as if borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we have seen them, I say, ruling and governing the world from a chair, their hunger turned into satiety, their cold into comfort, their nakedness into fine raiment, their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask, the justly earned reward of their virtue; but, contrasted and compared with what the warrior undergoes, all they have undergone falls far short of it, as I am now about to show.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) discourse Don Quixote said: <div class="bookquote">``As we began in the student's case with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if the soldier is richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no one poorer; for he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) is dependent on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) miserable pay, which comes late or never, or else on what he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) can plunder, seriously imperilling his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) life and conscience; and sometimes his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) nakedness will be so great that a slashed doublet serves him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) for uniform and shirt, and in the depth of winter he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) has to defend himself against the inclemency of the weather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) mouth, which I need not say, coming from an empty place, must come out cold, contrary to the laws of nature.
<p/>To be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) looks forward to the approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed that awaits him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), which, unless by some fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), never sins by being over narrow, for he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) can easily measure out on the ground as he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) likes, and roll himself about in it to his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) heart's content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>).
<p/>Then, after all this, suppose the day and hour for taking his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) degree in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) calling to have come; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when they invest him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) with the doctor's cap made of lint, to mend some bullet-hole, perhaps, that has gone through his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) temples, or left him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) with a crippled arm or leg.
<p/>Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven watches over him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) and keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) safe and sound, it may be he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) will be in the same poverty he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was in before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) must go through more engagements and more battles, and come victorious out of all before he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) betters himself; but miracles of that sort are seldom seen.
<p/>For tell me, sirs, if you have ever reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by war fall short of the number of those who have perished in it?
<p/>No doubt you will reply that there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot be numbered, while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with three figures.
<p/>All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters; for by skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of support; so that though the soldier has more to endure, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) reward is much less.
<p/>But against all this it may be urged that it is easier to reward two thousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by giving them places, which must perforce be conferred upon men of their calling, while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very property of the master they serve; but this impossibility only strengthens my argument.
<p/>Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which it is difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of arms over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments put forward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters say that without them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too, has its laws and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of letters and men of letters.
<p/>To this arms make answer that without them laws cannot be maintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdoms preserved, cities protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates; and, in short, if it were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies, cities, ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and confusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is free to make use of its privileges and powers.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER XXXVIII. WHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS AND LETTERS Continuing '' And then it is plain that whatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most.
<p/>To attain to eminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness, headaches, indigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which I have already referred to.
<p/>But for a man to come in the ordinary course of things to be a good soldier costs him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) all the student suffers, and in an incomparably higher degree, for at every step he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) runs the risk of losing his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) life.
<p/>For what dread of want or poverty that can reach or harass the student can compare with what the soldier feels, who finds himself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin or cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post where he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly from the imminent danger that threatens him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)?
<p/>All he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) can do is to inform his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) captain of what is going on so that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) may try to remedy it by a counter-mine, and then stand his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) ground in fear and expectation of the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into the deep against his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) will.
<p/>And if this seems a trifling risk, let us see whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys stem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one with the other, when the soldier has no more standing room than two feet of the plank of the spur; and yet, though he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) sees before him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) threatening him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) as many ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>), not a lance length from his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) body, and sees too that with the first heedless step he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) will go down to visit the profundities of Neptune's bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that nerves him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) makes himself a target for all that musketry, and struggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy's ship.
<p/>And what is still more marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) will never rise from till the end of the world, than another takes his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) place; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) too falls into the sea that waits for him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) like an enemy, another and another will succeed him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) without a moment's pause between their deaths: courage and daring the greatest that all the chances of war can show.
<p/>Happy the blest ages that knew not the dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>) diabolical invention, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>) made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life of a gallant gentleman; and that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows not how or whence, in the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave hearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one who fled in terror at the flash when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fired off his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) accursed machine, which in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life of one who deserved to live for ages to come.
<p/>And thus when I reflect on this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having adopted this profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we live in now; for though no peril can make me fear, still it gives me some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the opportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword.
<p/>But Heaven's will be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more honoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of yore exposed themselves to.
<p/>All this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others supped, forgetting to raise a morsel to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lips, though Sancho more than once told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) supper, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have time enough afterwards to say all he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wanted.
<p/>It excited fresh pity in those who had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to see a man of apparently sound sense, and with rational views on every subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wretched unlucky chivalry was in question.
<p/>The curate told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was quite right in all he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had said in favour of arms, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself, though a man of letters and a graduate, was of the same opinion.
<p/>They finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the hostess, her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La Mancha's garret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be quartered by themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the captive to tell them the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) life, for it could not fail to be strange and interesting, to judge by the hints he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had let fall on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) arrival in company with Zoraida.
<p/>To this the captive replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) would very willingly yield to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) request, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) feared his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) tale would not give them as much pleasure as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) wished; nevertheless, not to be wanting in compliance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) would tell it.
<p/>said there was no occasion ask, where a command had such weight, and added, <div class="bookquote">``If your worships will give me your attention you will hear a true story which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and studied art cannot come up to.
<p/>These words made them settle themselves in their places and preserve a deep silence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) seeing them waiting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) words in mute expectation, began thus in a pleasant quiet voice.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The curate others</b></font>)</div>The curate and the others thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) and added their entreaties, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) finding himself so pressed '' CHAPTER XXXIX.
<p/>My family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, and nature had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though in the general poverty of those communities my father passed for being even a rich man; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been so in reality
<p/>WHEREIN THE CAPTIVE RELATES HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) LIFE AND ADVENTURES had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been as clever in preserving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) property as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in spending it.
<p/>This tendency of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be liberal and profuse he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had acquired from having been a soldier in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youth, for the soldier's life is a school in which the niggard becomes free-handed and the free-handed prodigal; and if any soldiers are to be found who are misers, they are monsters of rare occurrence.
<p/>My father went beyond liberality and bordered on prodigality, a disposition by no means advantageous to a married man who has children to succeed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name and position.
<p/>Finding, then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unable to resist his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) propensity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolved to divest himself of the instrument and cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of wealth, without which Alexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and so calling us all three aside one day into a room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) addressed us in words somewhat to the following effect: <div class="bookquote">``My sons, to assure you that I love you, no more need be known or said than that you are my sons; and to encourage a suspicion that I do not love you, no more is needed than the knowledge that I have no self-control as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned; therefore, that you may for the future feel sure that I love you like a father, and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to do with you what I have for some time back meditated, and after mature deliberation decided upon.
<p/>You are now of an age to choose your line of life or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour and profit when you are older; and what I have resolved to do is to divide my property into four parts; three I will give to you, to each his (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>) portion without making any difference, and the other I will retain to live upon and support myself for whatever remainder of life
<p/>My father had three, all sons, and all of sufficient age to make choice of a profession. Heaven may be pleased to grant me.
<p/>But I wish each of you on taking possession of the share that falls to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to follow one of the paths I shall indicate.
<p/>In this Spain of ours there is a proverb, to my mind very true--as they all are, being short aphorisms drawn from long practical experience--and the one I refer to says, `The church, or the sea, or the king's house;' as much as to say, in plainer language, whoever wants to flourish and become rich, let him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) follow the church, or go to sea, adopting commerce as his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) calling, or go into the king's service in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) household, for they say, `Better a king's crumb than a lord's favour.'
<p/>I say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you should follow letters, another trade, and the third serve the king in the wars, for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) service in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) household, and if war does not bring much wealth it confers great distinction and fame.
<p/>Eight days hence I will give you your full shares in money, without defrauding you of a farthing, as you will see in the end.
<p/>Now tell me if you are willing to follow out my idea and advice as I have laid it before you.
<p/>Having called upon me as the eldest to answer, I, after urging him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) not to strip himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) property but to spend it all as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) pleased, for we were young men able to gain our living, consented to comply with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wishes, and said that mine were to follow the profession of arms and thereby serve God and my king.
<p/>My second brother having made the same proposal, decided upon going to the Indies, embarking the portion that fell to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in trade.
<p/>The youngest, and in my opinion the wisest, said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would rather follow the church, or go to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) studies at Salamanca.
<p/>As soon as we had come to an understanding, and made choice of our professions, my father embraced us all, and in the short time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mentioned carried into effect all he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had promised; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had given to each his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) share, which as well as I remember was three thousand ducats apiece in cash -LRB-for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid for it down, not to let it go out of the family-RRB-, we all three on the same day took leave of our good father; and at the same time, as it seemed to me inhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old age, I induced him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to take two of my three thousand ducats, as the remainder would be enough to provide me with all a soldier needed.
<p/>My two brothers, moved by my example, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) each a thousand ducats, so that there was left for my father four thousand ducats in money, besides three thousand, the value of the portion that fell to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) preferred to retain in land instead of selling it.
<p/>Finally, as I said, we took leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and of our uncle whom I have mentioned, not without sorrow and tears on both sides, they charging us to let them know whenever an opportunity offered how we fared, whether well or ill.
<p/>We promised to do so, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had embraced us and given us his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blessing, one set out for Salamanca, the other for Seville, and I for Alicante, where I had heard there was a Genoese vessel taking in a cargo of wool for Genoa.
<p/>It is now some twenty-two years since I left my father's house, and all that time, though I have written several letters, I have had no news whatever of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) or of my brothers; my own adventures during that period I will now relate briefly.
<p/>I embarked at Alicante, reached Genoa after a prosperous voyage, and proceeded thence to Milan, where I provided myself with arms and a few soldier's accoutrements; thence it was my intention to go and take service in Piedmont, but as I was already on the road to Alessandria della Paglia, I learned that the great Duke of Alva was on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) way to Flanders.
<p/>I changed my plans, joined him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), served under him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) in the campaigns he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) made, was present at the deaths of the Counts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to be ensign under a famous captain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name.
<p/>Some time after my arrival in Flanders news came of the league that his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) Holiness Pope Pius V of happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the common enemy, the Turk, who had just then with his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) fleet taken the famous island of Cyprus, which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable and disastrous.
<p/>It was known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of Austria, natural brother of our good king Don Philip, was coming as commander-in-chief of the allied forces, and rumours were abroad of the vast warlike preparations which were being made, all which stirred my heart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign which was expected; and though I had reason to believe, and almost certain promises, that on the first opportunity that presented itself I should be promoted to be captain
<p/>, I preferred to leave all and betake myself, as I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John had just arrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian fleet, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) afterwards did at Messina.
<p/>I may say, in short, that I took part in that glorious expedition, promoted by this time to be a captain of infantry, to which honourable charge my good luck rather than my merits raised me; and that day--so fortunate for Christendom, because then all the nations of the earth were disabused of the error under which they lay in imagining the Turks to be invincible on sea-on that day, I say, on which the Ottoman pride and arrogance were broken, among all that were there made happy -LRB-for the Christians who died that day were happier than those who remained alive and victorious-RRB-
<p/>had it been in Roman times, on the night that followed that famous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my hands.
<p/>It happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a daring and successful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltese galley -LRB-only three knights being left alive in it, and they badly wounded-RRB-, the chief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and my company were placed, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to do in such a case, I leaped on board the enemy's galley, which, sheering off from that which had attacked it, prevented my men from following me, and so I found myself alone in the midst of my enemies, who were in such numbers that I was unable to resist; in short I was taken, covered with wounds; El Uchali, as you know, sirs, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) escape with his (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) entire squadron, and I was left a prisoner in his (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) power, the only sad being among so many filled with joy, and the only captive among so many free; for there were fifteen thousand Christians, all at the oar in the Turkish fleet, that regained their longed-for liberty that day.
<p/>They carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made my master general at sea for having done his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) duty in the battle and carried off as evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) bravery the standard of the Order of Malta.
<p/>The following year, which was the year seventy-two, I found myself at Navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three lanterns.
<p/>There I saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the whole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all the marines and janizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to be attacked inside the very harbour, and had their kits and pasamaques, or shoes, ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed, in so great fear
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I alone was miserable; for, instead of some naval crown that I might have expected did they stand of our fleet.
<p/>But Heaven ordered it otherwise, not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded on our side, but for the sins of Christendom, and because it was God's will and pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishment to chastise us.
<p/>As it was, El Uchali took refuge at Modon, which is an island near Navarino, and landing forces fortified the mouth of the harbour and waited quietly until Don John retired.
<p/>It was taken by the chief Neapolitan galley called the She-wolf, commanded by that thunderbolt of war, that father of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) men, that successful and unconquered captain Don Alvaro de Bazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and
<p/>On this expedition was taken the galley called the Prize, whose captain was a son of the famous corsair Barbarossa. I cannot help telling you what took place at the capture of the Prize.
<p/>The son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) slaves so badly, that, when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley was bearing down upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once dropped their oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end of the gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) on from bench to bench, from the poop to the prow, they so bit him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) that before he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had got much past the mast his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) soul had already got to hell; so great, as I said, was the cruelty with which he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) treated them, and the hatred with which they hated him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>).
<p/>We returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three, it became known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdom from the Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end to the hopes which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in the world, entertained of returning to reign there.
<p/>The Grand Turk took the loss greatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) race possess, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) made peace with the Venetians -LRB-who were much more eager for it than he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) was-RRB-, and the following year, seventy-four, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) attacked the Goletta and the fort which Don John had left half built near Tunis.
<p/>While all these events were occurring, I was labouring at the oar without any hope of freedom; at least I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, for I was firmly resolved not to write to my father telling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) of my misfortunes.
<p/>At length the Goletta fell, and the fort fell, before which places there were seventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers, and more than four hundred thousand Moors and Arabs from all parts of Africa, and in the train of all this great host such munitions and engines of war, and so many pioneers that with their hands they might have covered the Goletta and the fort with handfuls of earth.
<p/>The first to fall was the Goletta, until then reckoned impregnable, and it fell, not by any fault of its defenders, who did all that they could and should have done, but because experiment proved how easily entrenchments could be made in the desert sand there; for water used to be found at two palms depth, while the Turks found none at two yards; and so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised their works so high that they commanded the walls of the fort, sweeping them as if from a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand or maintain the defence.
<p/>It was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up in the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the landing-place; but those who say so talk at random and with little knowledge of such matters; for if in the Goletta and in the fort there were barely seven thousand soldiers, how could such a small number, however resolute, sally out and hold their own against numbers like those of the enemy?
<p/>And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country?
<p/>But many thought, and I thought so too, that it was special favour and mercy which Heaven showed to Spain in permitting the destruction of that source and hiding place of mischief, that devourer, sponge, and moth of countless money, fruitlessly wasted there to no other purpose save preserving the memory of its capture by the invincible Charles V; as if to make that eternal, as it is and will be, these stones were needed to support it.
<p/>The fort also fell; but the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldiers who defended it fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the enemy killed in twenty-two general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand.
<p/>Of three hundred that remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clear and manifest proof of their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdily they had defended themselves and held their post.
<p/>A small fort or tower which was in the middle of the lagoon under the command of Don Juan Zanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous soldier, capitulated upon terms.
<p/>They took prisoner Don Pedro Puertocarrero, commandant of the Goletta, who had done all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) power to defend his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) fortress, and took the loss of it so much to heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) died of grief on the way to Constantinople, where they were carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) a prisoner.
<p/>They also took the commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a Milanese gentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier.
<p/>In these two fortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria, knight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as was shown by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) extreme liberality to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother, the famous John Andrea Doria; and what made his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) death the more sad was that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was slain by some Arabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entrusted himself, and who offered to conduct him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in the disguise of a Moor to Tabarca, a small fort or station on the coast held by the Genoese employed in the coral fishery.
<p/>These Arabs cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) head and carried it to the commander of the Turkish fleet, who proved on them the truth of our Castilian proverb, that <div class="bookquote">``though the treason may please, the traitor is hated;''  (<font color='red'><b>the commander</b></font>)</div>for they say he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) ordered those who brought him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) the present to be hanged for not having brought him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) alive.
<p/>Among the Christians who were taken in the fort was one named Don Pedro de Aguilar, a native of some place, I know not what, in Andalusia, who had been ensign in the fort, a soldier of great repute and rare intelligence, who had in particular a special gift for what they call poetry.
<p/>I say so because his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) fate brought him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) to my galley and to my bench, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) a slave to the same master; and before we left the port this gentleman composed two sonnets by way of epitaphs, one on the Goletta and the other on the fort; indeed, I may as well repeat them, for I have them by heart, and I think they will be liked rather than disliked.
<p/>The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, Don Fernando looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) companions and they all three smiled; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) came to speak of the sonnets one of them said, <div class="bookquote">``Before your worship proceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that Don Pedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.
<p/>All I know is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied the captive, <div class="bookquote">``that after having been in Constantinople two years, he (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, in company with a Greek spy; but whether he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) regained his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) liberty or not I cannot tell, though I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) did, because a year afterwards I saw the Greek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) what the result of the journey was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the captive</b></font>)</div><p/>Well then, you are right,'' returned the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``for that Don Pedro is my brother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is now in our village in good health, rich, married, and with three children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Thanks be to God for all the mercies he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has shown him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),'' said the captive; <div class="bookquote">``for to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with recovering lost liberty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the captive</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' '' And what is more,'' said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``I know the sonnets my brother made. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then let your worship repeat them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captive</b></font>)</div>said the captive, <div class="bookquote">``for you will recite them better than I can.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the captive</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman; <div class="bookquote">``that on the Goletta runs thus. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XL. IN WHICH THE STORY OF THE CAPTIVE IS CONTINUED.
<p/>, Above this lowly orb of ours abide Made heirs of heaven and immortality, With noble rage and ardour glowing ye
<p/>Your strength, while strength was yours, in battle plied, And with your own blood and the foeman's dyed The sandy soil and the encircling sea.
<p/>SONNET <div class="bookquote">``Blest souls, that, from this mortal husk set free, In guerdon of brave deeds beatified It was the ebbing life-blood first that failed The weary arms; the stout hearts never quailed.
<p/>Though vanquished, yet ye earned the victor's crown: Though mourned, yet still triumphant was your fall For there ye won, between the sword and wall,
<p/>Well then, that on the fort,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman shell</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, ``if my memory serves me, goes thus: SONNET <div class="bookquote">``Up from this wasted soil, this shattered shell, Whose walls and towers here in ruin lie, Three thousand soldier souls took wing on high,
<p/>In Heaven glory and on earth renown. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is it exactly, according to my recollection,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captive</b></font>)</div>said the captive. '' In the bright mansions of the blest to dwell.
<p/>The onslaught of the foeman to repel By might of arm all vainly did they try, And when at length 'twas left them but to die, Wearied and few the last defenders fell.
<p/>And this same arid soil hath ever been A haunt of countless mournful memories, As well in our day as in days of yore.
<p/>But never yet to Heaven it sent, I ween, From its hard bosom purer souls than these, Or braver bodies on its surface bore.
<p/>The sonnets were not disliked, and the captive was rejoiced at the tidings they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) comrade, and continuing his (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) tale, he (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) went on to say:
<p/>The Goletta and the fort being thus in their hands, the Turks gave orders to dismantle the Goletta--for the fort was reduced to such a state that there was nothing left to level--and to do the work more quickly and easily they mined it in three places; but nowhere were they able to blow up the part which seemed to be the least strong, that is to say, the old walls, while all that remained standing of the new fortifications that the Fratin had made came to the ground with the greatest ease.
<p/>, otherwise Uchali Fartax, which means in Turkish <div class="bookquote">``the scabby renegade;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for that he (<font color='blue'><b>renegade</b></font>) was; it is the practice with the Turks to name people from some defect or virtue they may possess; the reason being that there are among them only four surnames belonging to families tracing their descent from the Ottoman house, and the others, as I have said, take their names and surnames either from bodily blemishes or moral qualities.
<p/>This <div class="bookquote">``scabby one''  (<font color='red'><b>a slave</b></font>)</div>rowed at the oar as a slave of the Grand Signor's for fourteen years, and when over thirty-four years of age, in resentment at having been struck by a Turk while at the oar, turned renegade and renounced his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) faith in order to be able to revenge himself; and such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) valour that, without owing his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) advancement to the base ways and means by which most favourites of the Grand Signor rise to power, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) came to be king of Algiers, and afterwards general-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the realm.
<p/>'' Finally the fleet returned victorious and triumphant to Constantinople, and a few months later died my master, El Uchali He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a Calabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slaves with great humanity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had three thousand of them, and after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death they were divided, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directed by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will, between the Grand Signor -LRB-who is heir of all who die and shares with the children of the deceased-RRB- and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) renegades.
<p/>I fell to the lot of a Venetian renegade who, when a cabin boy on board a ship, had been taken by Uchali and was so much beloved by him (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) became one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) most favoured youths.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) came to be the most cruel renegade I ever saw: his (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) name was Hassan Aga, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) grew very rich and became king of Algiers.
<p/>With him (<font color='blue'><b>Uchali</b></font>) I went there from Constantinople, rather glad to be so near Spain, not that I intended to write to anyone about my unhappy lot, but to try if fortune would be kinder to me in Algiers than in Constantinople, where I had attempted in a thousand ways to escape without ever finding a favourable time or chance; but in Algiers I resolved to seek for other means of effecting the purpose I cherished so dearly; for the hope of obtaining my liberty never deserted me; and when in my plots and schemes and attempts the result did not answer my expectations, without giving way to despair
<p/>I immediately began to look out for or conjure up some new hope to support me, however faint or feeble it might be.
<p/>In this way I lived on immured in a building or prison called by the Turks a bano in which they confine the Christian captives, as well those that are the king's as those belonging to private individuals, and also what they call those of the Almacen, which is as much as to say the slaves of the municipality, who serve the city in the public works and other employments; but captives of this kind recover their liberty with great difficulty, for, as they are public property and have no particular master, there is no one with whom to treat for their ransom, even though they may have the means.
<p/>To these banos, as I have said, some private individuals of the town are in the habit of bringing their captives, especially when they are to be ransomed; because there they can keep them in safety and comfort until their ransom arrives.
<p/>The king's captives also, that are on ransom, do not go out to work with the rest of the crew, unless when their ransom is delayed; for then, to make them write for it more pressingly, they compel them to work and go for wood, which is no light labour.
<p/>I, however, was one of those on ransom, for when it was discovered that I was a captain, although I declared my scanty means and want of fortune, nothing could dissuade them from including me among the gentlemen and those waiting to be ransomed.
<p/>They put a chain on me, more as a mark of this than to keep me safe, and so I passed my life in that bano with several other gentlemen and persons of quality marked out as held to ransom; but though at times, or rather almost always, we suffered from hunger and scanty clothing, nothing distressed us so much as hearing and seeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard-of cruelties my master inflicted upon the Christians.
<p/>Every day he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hanged a man, impaled one, cut off the ears of another; and all with so little provocation, or so entirely without any, that the Turks acknowledged he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did it merely for the sake of doing it, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was by nature murderously disposed towards the whole human race.
<p/>The only one that fared at all well with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a Spanish soldier, something de Saavedra by name, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Saavedra</b></font>) never gave a blow himself, or ordered a blow to be given, or addressed a hard word, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Saavedra</b></font>) had done things that will dwell in the memory of the people there for many a year, and all to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Saavedra</b></font>) liberty; and for the least of the many things he (<font color='blue'><b>Saavedra</b></font>) did we all dreaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Saavedra</b></font>) would be impaled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Saavedra</b></font>) himself was in fear of it more than once; and only that time does not allow, I could tell you now something of what that soldier did, that would interest and astonish you much more than the narration of my own tale.
<p/>To go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison was overlooked by the windows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of high position; and these, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather loopholes than windows, and besides were covered with thick and close lattice-work.
<p/>It so happened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of our prison with three other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far we could leap with our chains, we being alone, for all the other Christians had gone out to work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and from one of these little closed windows I saw a reed appear with a cloth attached to the end of it, and it kept waving to and fro, and moving as if making signs to us to come and take it.
<p/>We watched it, and one of those who were with me went and stood under the reed to see whether they would let it drop, or what they would do, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) did so the reed was raised and moved from side to side, as if they meant to say <div class="bookquote">``no''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by a shake of the head.
<p/>Another of my comrades went, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) the same happened as with the first, and then the third went forward, but with the same result as the first and second.
<p/>I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as I came under the reed it was dropped and fell inside the bano at my feet.
<p/>I hastened to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in this were ten cianis, which are coins of base gold, current among the Moors, and each worth ten reals of our money.
<p/>It is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was not less than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune could have come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness to drop the reed for any
<p/>The Christian came back, and it was again lowered, making the same movements as before. Seeing this but me showed that it was for me the favour was intended.
<p/>I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to the terrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out that opened and shut very quickly.
<p/>From this we gathered or fancied that it must be some woman living in that house that had done us this kindness, and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams after the fashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and crossing the arms on the breast.
<p/>This sign led us to believe that some Christian woman was a captive in the house, and that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who had been so good to us; but the whiteness of the hand and the bracelets we had perceived made us dismiss that idea, though we thought it might be one of the Christian renegades whom their masters very often take as lawful wives, and gladly, for they prefer them to the women of their own nation.
<p/>In all our conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that time forward our sole occupation was watching and gazing at the window where the cross had appeared to us, as if it were our pole-star; but at least fifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand, or any other sign
<p/>and though meanwhile we endeavoured with the utmost pains to ascertain who it was that lived in the house, and whether there were any Christian renegade in it, nobody could ever tell us anything more than that he (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) who lived there was a rich Moor of high position, Hadji Morato by name, formerly alcaide of La Pata, an office of high dignity among them.
<p/>But when we least thought it was going to rain any more cianis from that quarter, we saw the reed suddenly appear with another cloth tied in a larger knot attached to it, and this at a time when, as on the former occasion, the bano was deserted and unoccupied.
<p/>We made trial as before, each of the same three going forward before I did; but the reed was delivered to none but me, and on my approach it was let drop.
<p/>I untied the knot and I found forty Spanish gold crowns with a paper written in Arabic, and at the end of the writing there was a large cross drawn.
<p/>I kissed the cross, took the crowns and returned to the terrace, and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared, I made signs that I would read the paper, and then the window was closed.
<p/>We were all puzzled, though filled with joy at what had taken place; and as none of us understood Arabic, great was our curiosity to know what the paper contained, and still greater the difficulty of finding some one to read it.
<p/>At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, a native of Murcia, who professed a very great friendship for me, and had given pledges that bound him (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) to keep any secret I might entrust to him (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>); for it is the custom with some renegades, when they intend to return to Christian territory, to carry about them certificates from captives of mark testifying, in whatever form they can, that such and such a renegade is a worthy man who has always shown kindness to Christians, and is anxious to escape on the first opportunity that may present itself.
<p/>Some obtain these testimonials with good intentions, others put them to a cunning use; for when they go to pillage on Christian territory, if they chance to be cast away, or taken prisoners, they produce their certificates and say that from these papers may be seen the object they came for, which was to remain on Christian ground, and that it was to this end they joined the Turks in their foray.
<p/>In this way they escape the consequences of the first outburst and make their peace with the Church before it does them any harm, and then when they have the chance they return to Barbary to become what they were before.
<p/>Shortly afterwards at the same window a small cross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. Others, however, there are who procure these papers and make use of them honestly, and remain on Christian soil.
<p/>This friend of mine, then, was one of these renegades that I have described; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had certificates from all our comrades, in which we testified in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) favour as strongly as we could; and if the Moors had found the papers they would have burned him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) alive.
<p/>I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) understood Arabic very well, and could not only speak but also write it; but before I disclosed the whole matter to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to read for me this paper which I had found by accident in a hole in my cell.
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) understood it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did perfectly well, and that if I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to tell me its meaning word for word, I must give him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pen and ink that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might do it more satisfactorily.
<p/>We at once gave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) required, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) set about translating it bit by bit, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had done he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said: ``All that is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, and you must bear in mind that when it says `Lela Marien' it means `Our Lady the Virgin Mary.'
<p/>We read the paper and it ran thus: <div class="bookquote">``When I was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray the Christian prayer in my own language, and told me many things about Lela Marien.
<p/>The Christian died, and I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) did not go to the fire, but to Allah, because since then I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) twice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) told me to go to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who had great love for me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) opened it and remained some time examining it and muttering to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) translated it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I know not how to go.
<p/>I have seen many Christians, but except thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young and beautiful, and have plenty of money to take with me.
<p/>See if thou canst contrive how we may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband there, and if thou wilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marien will find me some one to marry me.
<p/>I myself have written this: have a care to whom thou givest it to read: trust no Moor, for they are all perfidious.
<p/>I am greatly troubled on this account, for I would not have thee confide in anyone, because if my father knew it he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would at once fling me down a well and cover me with stones.
<p/>I will put a thread to the reed; tie the answer to it, and if thou hast no one to write for thee in Arabic, tell it to me by signs, for Lela Marien will make me understand thee.
<p/>Judge, sirs, whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words of this paper; and both one and the other were so great, that the renegade perceived that the paper had not been found by chance, but had been in reality addressed to some one of us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) begged us, if what he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) suspected were the truth, to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) all, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) would risk his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) life for our freedom; and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) took out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) breast a metal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God the image represented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) truly and faithfully believed, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we chose to reveal to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought and almost foresaw that by means of her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) who had written that paper, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and all of us would obtain our liberty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) himself obtain the object he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) so much desired, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) restoration to the bosom of the Holy Mother Church, from which by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own sin and ignorance he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was now severed like a corrupt limb.
<p/>The renegade said this with so many tears and such signs of repentance, that with one consent we all agreed to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the whole truth of the matter, and so we gave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a full account of all, without hiding anything from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>We pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the window at which the reed appeared, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) by that means took note of the house, and resolved to ascertain with particular care who lived in it.
<p/>We agreed also that it would be advisable to answer the Moorish lady's letter, and the renegade without a moment's delay took down the words I dictated to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), which were exactly what I shall tell you, for nothing of importance that took place in this affair has escaped my memory, or ever will while life lasts.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and Allah and this cross, which I often kiss as the captive bade me, protect thee. '' This, then, was the answer returned to the Moorish lady:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The true Allah protect thee, Lady, and that blessed Marien who is the true mother of God, and who has put it into thy heart to go to the land of the Christians, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) loves thee.
<p/>Entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) be pleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) gives thee, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) will, such is her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) goodness.
<p/>On my own part, and on that of all these Christians who are with me, I promise to do all that we can for thee, even to death.
<p/>Fail not to write to me and inform me what thou dost mean to do, and I will always answer thee; for the great Allah has given us a Christian captive who can speak and write thy language well, as thou mayest see by this paper; without fear, therefore, thou canst inform us of all thou wouldst.
<p/>As to what thou sayest, that if thou dost reach the land of the Christians thou wilt be my wife, I give thee my promise upon it as a good Christian; and know that the Christians keep their promises better than the Moors.
<p/>The paper being written and folded I waited two days until the bano was empty as before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the terrace to see if there were any sign of the reed, which was not long in making its appearance.
<p/>As soon as I saw it, although I could not distinguish who put it out, I showed the paper as a sign to attach the thread, but it was already fixed to the reed, and to it I tied the paper; and shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearance with the white flag of peace, the little bundle.
<p/>It was dropped, and I picked it up, and found in the cloth, in gold and silver coins of all sorts, more than fifty crowns, which fifty times more strengthened our joy and doubled our hope of gaining our liberty.
<p/>That very night our renegade returned and said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had learned that the Moor we had been told of lived in that house, that his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) name was Hadji Morato, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was enormously rich, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had one only daughter the heiress of all his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wealth, and that it was the general opinion throughout the city that she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) was the most beautiful woman in Barbary, and that several of the viceroys who came there had sought her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) for a wife, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) had been always unwilling to marry; and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had learned, moreover, that she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) had a Christian slave who was now dead; all which agreed with the contents of the paper.
<p/>We immediately took counsel with the renegade as to what means would have to be adopted in order to carry off the Moorish lady and bring us all to Christian territory; and in the end it was agreed that for the present we should wait for a second communication from Zoraida -LRB-for that was the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) who now desires to be called Maria-RRB-, because we saw clearly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) and no one else could find a way out of all these difficulties.
<p/>When we had decided upon this the renegade told us not to be uneasy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) life or restore us to liberty.
<p/>For four days the bano was filled with people, for which reason the reed delayed its appearance for four days, but at the end of that time, when the bano was, as it generally was, empty, it appeared with the cloth so bulky that it promised a happy birth.
<p/>Reed and cloth came down to me, and I found another paper and a hundred crowns in gold, without any other coin.
<p/>Allah and Marien his (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) mother watch over thee, my Lady. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>The renegade was present, and in our cell we gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) the paper to read, which was to this effect:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think of a plan, senor, for our going to Spain, nor has Lela Marien shown me one, though I have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>).
<p/>With it ransom yourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land of the Christians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) will find me in my father's garden, which is at the Babazon gate near the seashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father and my servants.
<p/>All that can be done is for me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. You can carry me away from there by night without any danger, and bring me to the vessel.
<p/>If thou canst not trust anyone to go for the vessel, ransom thyself and do thou go, for I know thou wilt return more surely than any other, as thou art a gentleman and a Christian.
<p/>Endeavour to make thyself acquainted with the garden; and when I see thee walking yonder I shall know that the bano is empty and I will give thee abundance of money.
<p/>And remember thou art to be my husband, else I will pray to Marien to punish thee. Allah protect thee, senor.
<p/>These were the words and contents of the second paper, and on hearing them, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, and promised to go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too made the same offer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) would not on any account consent to one being set free before all went together, as experience had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) how ill those who have been set free keep promises which they made in captivity; for captives of distinction frequently had recourse to this plan, paying the ransom of one who was to go to Valencia or Majorca with money to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) to arm a bark and return for the others who had ransomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>), but who never came back; for recovered liberty and the dread of losing it again efface from the memory all the obligations in the world.
<p/>And to prove the truth of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) told us briefly what had happened to a certain Christian gentleman almost at that very time, the strangest case that had ever occurred even there, where astonishing and marvellous things are happening every instant.
<p/>what could and ought to be done was to give the money intended for the ransom of one of us Christians to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) might with it buy a vessel there in Algiers under the pretence of becoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the coast; and when master of the vessel, it would be easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to hit on some way of getting us all out of the bano and putting us on board; especially if the Moorish lady gave, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, money enough to ransom all, because once free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark even in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do not allow any renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vessel for going on roving expeditions, because they are afraid that anyone who buys a small vessel, especially if he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) be a Spaniard, only wants it for the purpose of escaping to Christian territory.
<p/>This however he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could get over by arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) in the purchase of the vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; and under cover of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) could become master of the vessel, in which case he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) looked upon all the rest as accomplished.
<p/>But though to me and my comrades it had seemed a better plan to send to Majorca for the vessel, as the Moorish lady suggested, we did not dare to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>), fearing that if we did not do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) would denounce us, and place us in danger of losing all our lives if he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) were to disclose our dealings with Zoraida, for whose life we would have all given our own.
<p/>We therefore resolved to put ourselves in the hands of God and in the renegade's; and at the same time an answer was given to Zoraida, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) that we would do all she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) recommended, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) had given as good advice as if Lela Marien had delivered it, and that it depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) alone whether we were to defer the business or put it in execution at once.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ended by saying that I renewed my promise to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) husband; and thus the next day that the bano chanced to be empty
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) at different times gave us by means of the reed and cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) said that the next Juma, that is to say Friday, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) was going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) father's garden, but that before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) went she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) would give us more money; and if it were not enough we were to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) know, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) would give us as much as we asked, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) father had so much he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not miss it, and besides she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) kept all the keys.
<p/>We at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, and with eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencian merchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, and who had me released on his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first ship from Valencia he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) would pay my ransom; for if he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) had given the money at once it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been for a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) own advantage
<p/>In fact my master was so difficult to deal with that I dared not on any account pay down the money at once.
<p/>The Thursday before the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the garden she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) gave us a thousand crowns more, and warned us of her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) departure, begging me, if I were ransomed, to find out her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father's garden at once, and by all means to seek an opportunity of going there to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>).
<p/>I answered in a few words that I would do so, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) must remember to commend us to Lela Marien with all the prayers the captive had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>).
<p/>This having been done, steps were taken to ransom our three comrades, so as to enable them to quit the bano, and lest, seeing me ransomed and themselves not, though the money was forthcoming, they should make a disturbance about it and the devil should prompt them to do something that might injure Zoraida; for though their position might be sufficient to relieve me from this apprehension, nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk in the matter; and so I had them ransomed in the same way as I was, handing over all the money to the merchant so that he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) might with safety and confidence give security; without, however, confiding our arrangement and secret to him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>), which might have been dangerous.
<p/>Before fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an excellent vessel with room for more than thirty persons; and to make the transaction safe and lend a colour to it, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) thought it well to make, as he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) did, a voyage to a place called Shershel, twenty leagues from Algiers on the Oran side, where there is an extensive trade in dried figs.
<p/>kept it secret. CHAPTER XLI. IN WHICH THE CAPTIVE STILL CONTINUES HIS (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) ADVENTURES Two or three times he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) made this voyage in company with the Tagarin already mentioned.
<p/>The Moors of Aragon are called Tagarins in Barbary, and those of Granada Mudejars; but in the Kingdom of Fez they call the Mudejars Elches, and they are the people the king chiefly employs in war.
<p/>To proceed: every time he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) passed with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) vessel he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) anchored in a cove that was not two crossbow shots from the garden where Zoraida was waiting; and there the renegade, together with the two Moorish lads that rowed, used purposely to station himself, either going through his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) prayers, or else practising as a part what he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) meant to perform in earnest.
<p/>And thus he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) would go to Zoraida's garden and ask for fruit, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father gave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), not knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); but though, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) afterwards told me, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sought to speak to Zoraida, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) who he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, and that by my orders he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) to the land of the Christians, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) might feel satisfied and easy, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never been able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow themselves to be seen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid them: with Christian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and communication, even more than might be considered proper.
<p/>But for my part I should have been sorry if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>), for perhaps it might have alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) affairs talked of by renegades.
<p/>But God, who ordered it otherwise, afforded no opportunity for our renegade's well-meant purpose; and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), seeing how safely he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could go to Shershel and return, and anchor when and how and where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) liked, and that the Tagarin his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) partner had no will but his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and that, now I was ransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to row, told me to look out for any I should be willing to take with me, over and above those who had been ransomed, and to engage them for the next Friday, which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fixed upon for our departure.
<p/>On this I spoke to twelve Spaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave the city; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, because there were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the rowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not that their master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order to finish a galliot that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had upon the stocks.
<p/>To these men I said nothing more than that the next Friday in the evening they were to come out stealthily one by one and hang about Hadji Morato's garden, waiting for me there until I came.
<p/>These directions I gave each one separately, with orders that if they saw any other Christians there they were not to say anything to them except that I had directed them to wait at that spot.
<p/>This preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step had to be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) might be prepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surprise if we were suddenly to seize upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) thought the Christians' vessel could have returned.
<p/>I determined, therefore, to go to the garden and try if I could speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>); and the day before my departure I went there under the pretence of gathering herbs.
<p/>The first person I met was her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father, who addressed me in the language that all over Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium between captives and Moors, and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any other nation, but a mixture of all languages, by means of which we can all understand one another.
<p/>In this sort of language, I say, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked me what I wanted in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) garden, and to whom I belonged.
<p/>I replied that I was a slave of the Arnaut Mami -LRB-for I knew as a certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was a very great friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)-RRB-, and that I wanted some herbs to make a salad.
<p/>While these questions and answers were proceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some time before, came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women are by no means particular about letting themselves be seen by Christians, or, as I have said before, at all coy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) had no hesitation in coming to where her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father stood with me; moreover her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) approaching slowly, called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) to come.
<p/>It would be beyond my power now to describe to you the great beauty, the high-bred air, the brilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) presented herself before my eyes.
<p/>I will content myself with saying that more pearls hung from her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) fair neck, her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) ears, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) hair than she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) had hairs on her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) head.
<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) ankles, which as is customary were bare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) had carcajes -LRB-for so bracelets or anklets are called in Morisco-RRB- of the purest gold, set with so many diamonds that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) told me afterwards her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father valued them at ten thousand doubloons, and those she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) wrists were worth as much more.
<p/>The pearls were in profusion and very fine, for the highest display and adornment of the Moorish women is decking themselves with rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of these there are therefore more among the Moors than among any other people.
<p/>Zoraida's father had to the reputation of possessing a great number, and the purest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than two hundred thousand Spanish crowns; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>), who is now mistress of me only, was mistress of all this.
<p/>Whether thus adorned she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would have been beautiful or not, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) must have been in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) prosperity, may be imagined from the beauty remaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) after so many hardships; for, as everyone knows, the beauty of some women has its times and its seasons, and is increased or diminished by chance causes; and naturally the emotions of the mind will heighten or impair it, though indeed more frequently they totally destroy it.
<p/>In a word she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) presented herself before me that day attired with the utmost splendour, and supremely beautiful; at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) seemed to me the most beautiful object I had ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) I felt as though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me relief and happiness.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) father told her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own language that I was a captive belonging to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come for salad.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mami</b></font>) took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have spoken of she (<font color='blue'><b>Mami</b></font>) asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not ransomed.
<p/>I answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might be seen what value my master set on me, as I had given one thousand five hundred zoltanis for me; to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mami</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Hadst thou been my father's, I can tell thee, I would not have let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) part with thee for twice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and make yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked me then whether I were on ransom or not, and what my master demanded for me. '' That may be, lady,'' said I;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but indeed I dealt truthfully with my master, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>To-morrow, I think,'' said I, ``for there is a vessel here from France which sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it not be better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zoraida</b></font>)</div>said Zoraida, <div class="bookquote">``to wait for the arrival of ships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not your friends?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Zoraida</b></font>)</div><p/>And when dost thou go?'' said Zoraida. '' '' '' No,'' said I; <div class="bookquote">``though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now coming from Spain
<p/>I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to return to my country and to those I love is so great that it will not allow me to wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if it be delayed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt thou art married in thine own country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zoraida</b></font>)</div>said Zoraida, <div class="bookquote">``and for that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.
<p/>it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it is more likely ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zoraida</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not married,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, <div class="bookquote">``but
<p/>I have given my promise to marry on my arrival there.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?'' said Zoraida.
<p/>'' So beautiful,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``that, to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) worthily and tell thee the truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) is very like thee. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>At this her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father laughed very heartily and said, ``By Allah, Christian, she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) must be very beautiful if she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) is like my daughter, who is the most beautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) well and thou wilt see I am telling the truth.
<p/>Zoraida's father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of these words and phrases, for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) spoke the bastard language, that, as I have said, is employed there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) meaning more by signs than by words.
<p/>While we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came running up, exclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the garden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe.
<p/>The old man was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so to speak, instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of the soldiers, who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who are under their power that they treat them worse than if they were their slaves.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father said to Zoraida, ``Daughter, retire into the house and shut thyself in while I go and speak to these dogs; and thou, Christian, pick thy herbs, and go in peace, and Allah bring thee safe to thy own country.
<p/>I bowed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone with Zoraida, who made as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) were about to retire as her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>); but
<p/>the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was concealed by the trees of the garden, turning to me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) eyes full of tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) said, ``Tameji, cristiano, tameji?
<p/>I made answer, ``Yes, lady, but not without thee, come what may: be on the watch for me on the next Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seest us; for most surely we shall go to the land of the Christians.
<p/>I said in such a way that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) understood perfectly all that passed between us, and throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm round my neck she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began with feeble steps to move towards the house; but as fate would have it -LRB-and it might have been very unfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise ordered it-RRB-, just as we were moving on in the manner and position I have described, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm round my neck, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) returned after having sent away the Turks, saw how we were walking and we perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw us; but Zoraida, ready and quickwitted, took care not to remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) arm from my neck, but on the contrary drew closer to me and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) head on my breast, bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) knees a little and showing all the signs and tokens of fainting, while I at the same time made it seem as though I were supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) against my will.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father came running up to where we were, and seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter in this state asked what was the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>), however, giving no answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) has fainted in alarm at the entrance of those dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) from mine he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own breast, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) sighing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) eyes still wet with tears, said again, <div class="bookquote">``Ameji, cristiano, ameji'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--``Go, Christian, go.
<p/>To this her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father replied, <div class="bookquote">``There is no need, daughter, for the Christian to go, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) has done thee no harm, and the Turks have now gone; feel no alarm, there is nothing to hurt thee, for as I say, the Turks at my request have gone back the way they came.''
 (<font color='red'><b>this father</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' that is to say, <div class="bookquote">``Art thou going, Christian, art thou going? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' This '' <div class="bookquote">``It was they who terrified her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>), as thou hast said, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I to her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father;
<p/>``but since she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) tells me to go, I have no wish to displease her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>): peace be with thee, and with thy leave I will come back to this garden for herbs if need be, for my master
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come back for any thou hast need of,''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>replied Hadji Morato; ``for my daughter does not speak thus because she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is displeased with thee or any Christian: she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) only meant that the Turks should go, not thou; or that it was time for thee to look for thy herbs.
<p/>With this I at once took my leave of both; and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), looking as though her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heart were breaking, retired with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father.
<p/>While pretending to look for herbs I made the round of the garden at my ease, and studied carefully all the approaches and outlets, and the fastenings of the house and everything that could be taken advantage of to make our task easy.
<p/>Having done so I went and gave an account of all that had taken place to the renegade and my comrades, and looked forward with impatience to the hour when, all fear at an end, I should find myself in possession of the prize which fortune held out to me in the fair and lovely Zoraida.
<p/>The time passed at length, and the appointed day we so longed for arrived; and, all following out the arrangement and plan which, after careful consideration and many a long discussion, we had decided upon, we succeeded as fully as we could have wished; for on the Friday following the day upon which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, the renegade anchored his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) vessel at nightfall almost opposite the spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) was.
<p/>The Christians who were to row were ready and in hiding in different places round about, all waiting for me, anxious and elated, and eager to attack the vessel they had before their eyes; for they did not know the renegade's plan, but expected that they were to gain their liberty by force of arms and by killing the Moors who were on board the vessel.
<p/>As soon, then, as I and my comrades made our appearance, all those that were in hiding seeing us came and joined us.
<p/>It was now the time when the city gates are shut, and there was no one to be seen in all the space outside.
<p/>When we were collected together we debated whether it would be better first to go for Zoraida, or to make prisoners of the Moorish rowers who rowed in the vessel; but while we were still uncertain our renegade came up asking us what kept us, as it was now the time, and all the Moors were off their guard and most of them asleep.
<p/>We told him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) why we hesitated, but he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) said it was of more importance first to secure the vessel, which could be done with the greatest ease and without any danger, and then we could go for Zoraida.
<p/>We all approved of what he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) said, and so without further delay, guided by him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) we made for the vessel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) leaping on board first, drew his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) cutlass and said in Morisco, ``Let no one stir from this if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) does not want it to cost him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) life.
<p/>By this almost all the Christians were on board, and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearing their captain speak in this way, were cowed, and without any one of them taking to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) arms -LRB-and indeed they had few or hardly any-RRB- they submitted without saying a word to be bound by the Christians, who quickly secured them, threatening them that if they raised any kind of outcry they would be all put to the sword.
<p/>This having been accomplished, and half of our party being left to keep guard over them, the rest of us, again taking the renegade as our guide, hastened towards Hadji Morato's garden, and as good luck would have it, on trying the gate it opened as easily as if it had not been locked; and so, quite quietly and in silence, we reached the house without being perceived by anybody.
<p/>The lovely Zoraida was watching for us at a window, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) perceived that there were people there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) asked in a low voice if we were <div class="bookquote">``Nizarani,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as much as to say or ask if we were Christians.
<p/>says there are nowhere better herbs for salad then here. '' '' '' I answered that we were, and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) to come down.
<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) recognised me she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) did not delay an instant, but without answering a word came down immediately, opened the door and presented herself before us all, so beautiful and so richly attired that I cannot attempt to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>).
<p/>I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) hand and kissed it, and the renegade and my two comrades did the same; and the rest, who knew nothing of the circumstances, did as they saw us do, for it only seemed as if we were returning thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>), and recognising her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) as the giver of our liberty.
<p/>The moment I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) The renegade asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) in the Morisco language if her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father was in the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was asleep.
<p/>Then it will be necessary to waken him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with us,'' said the renegade, ``and everything of value in this fair mansion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``my father must not on any account be touched, and there is nothing in the house except what I shall take, and that will be quite enough to enrich and satisfy all of you; wait a little and you shall see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and so saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) went in, telling us she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) would return immediately and bidding us keep quiet making any noise.
<p/>I asked the renegade what had passed between them, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me, I declared that nothing should be done except in accordance with the wishes of Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full of gold crowns that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) could scarcely carry it.
<p/>Unfortunately her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father awoke while this was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came to the window, and at once perceiving that all those who were there were Christians, raising a prodigiously loud outcry, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began to call out in Arabic, <div class="bookquote">``Christians, Christians!
<p/>by which cries we were all thrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; but the renegade seeing the danger we were in and how important it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to effect his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) purpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmost quickness to where Hadji Morato was, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>) went some of our party; I, however, did not dare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen almost fainting in my arms.
<p/>To be brief, those who had gone upstairs acted so promptly that in an instant they came down, carrying Hadji Morato with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>) hands bound and a napkin tied over his (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>) mouth, which prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>) from uttering a word, warning him (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>) at the same time that to attempt to speak would cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>) life.
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>) daughter caught sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) covered her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) eyes so as not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Morato</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father was horror-stricken, not knowing how willingly she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had placed herself in our hands.
<p/>But it was now most essential for us to be on the move, and carefully and quickly we regained the vessel, where those who had remained on board were waiting for us in apprehension of some mishap having befallen us.
<p/>It was barely two hours after night set in when we were all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from the hands of Zoraida's father, and the napkin from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mouth; but the renegade once more told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not to utter a word, or they would take his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and still more when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) perceived that I held her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) closely embraced and that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing any reluctance; nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remained silent lest they should carry into effect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Finding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with the oars, Zoraida, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father there, and the other Moors bound, bade the renegade ask me to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) the favour of releasing the Moors and setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father at liberty, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) would rather drown herself in the sea than suffer a father that had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) so dearly to be carried away captive before her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) eyes and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) account.
<p/>The renegade repeated this to me, and I replied that I was very willing to do so; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied that it was not advisable, because if they were left there they would at once raise the country and stir up the city, and lead to the despatch of swift cruisers in pursuit, and our being taken, by sea or land, without any possibility of escape; and that all that could be done was to set them free on the first Christian ground we reached.
<p/>On this point we all agreed; and Zoraida, to whom it was explained, together with the reasons that prevented us from doing at once what she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) desired, was satisfied likewise; and then in glad silence and with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took his (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) oar, and commending ourselves to God with all our hearts, we began to shape our course for the island of Majorca, the nearest Christian land.
<p/>Owing, however, to the Tramontana rising a little, and the sea growing somewhat rough, it was impossible for us to keep a straight course for Majorca, and we were compelled to coast in the direction of Oran, not without great uneasiness on our part lest we should be observed from the town of Shershel, which lies on that coast, not more than sixty miles from Algiers.
<p/>Moreover we were afraid of meeting on that course one of the galliots that usually come with goods from Tetuan; although each of us for himself and all of us together felt confident that, if we were to meet a merchant galliot, so that it were not a cruiser, not only should we not be lost, but that we should take a vessel in which we could more safely accomplish our voyage.
<p/>As we pursued our course Zoraida kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) head between my hands so as not to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father, and I felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) was praying to Lela Marien to help us.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' thieves, thieves! '' We might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some three musket-shots off the land, which seemed to us deserted, and without anyone to see us.
<p/>For all that, however, by hard rowing we put out a little to sea, for it was now somewhat calmer, and having gained about two leagues the word was given to row by batches, while we ate something, for the vessel was well provided; but the rowers said it was not a time to take any rest; let food be served out to those who were not rowing, but they would not leave their oars on any account.
<p/>This was done, but now a stiff breeze began to blow, which obliged us to leave off rowing and make sail at once and steer for Oran, as it was impossible to make any other course.
<p/>All this was done very promptly, and under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without any fear, except that of coming across some vessel out on a roving expedition.
<p/>We gave the Moorish rowers some food, and the renegade comforted them by telling them that they were not held as captives, as we should set them free on the first opportunity.
<p/>The same was said to Zoraida's father, who replied, ``Anything else, Christian, I might hope for or think likely from your generosity and good behaviour, but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will give me my liberty; for you would have never exposed yourselves to the danger of depriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously, especially as you know who I am and the sum you may expect to receive on restoring it; and if you will only name that, I here offer you all you require for myself and for my unhappy daughter there; or else for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) alone, for she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is the greatest and most precious part of my soul.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said this he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) began to weep so bitterly that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) filled us all with compassion and forced Zoraida to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) weeping
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) was so moved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) rose from my feet and ran to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) face to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
<p/>, they both gave way to such an outburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keep them company.
<p/>But when her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) in full dress and with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) jewels about her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own language, <div class="bookquote">``What means this, my daughter?
<p/>Last night, before this terrible misfortune in which we are plunged befell us, I saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments; and now, without having had time to attire thyself, and without my bringing thee any joyful tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and bedecking thyself, I see thee arrayed in the finest attire it would be in my power to give thee when fortune was most kind to us.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Answer me this ; for it causes me greater anxiety and surprise than even this misfortune itself. '' The renegade interpreted to us what the Moor said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) daughter; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), however, returned him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) no answer.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) observed in one corner of the vessel the little trunk in which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) used to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) jewels, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) well knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) had left in Algiers and had not brought to the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was still more amazed, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) how that trunk had come into our hands, and what there was in it.
<p/>To which the renegade, without waiting for Zoraida to reply, made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Do not trouble thyself by asking thy daughter Zoraida so many questions, senor, for the one answer I will give thee will serve for all; I would have thee know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) is a Christian, and that it is she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) who has been the file for our chains and our deliverer from captivity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) is here of her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) own free will, as glad, I imagine, to find herself in this position as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) who escapes from darkness into the light, from death to life, and from suffering to glory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Zoraida</b></font>)</div><p/>That thou art in truth a Christian,'' said the old man, ``and that thou hast given thy father into the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) enemies?
<p/>To which Zoraida made answer, <div class="bookquote">``A Christian I am, but it is not I who have placed thee in this position, for it never was my wish to leave thee or do thee harm, but only to do good to myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Zoraida</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Daughter, is this true, what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Moor</b></font>)</div>cried the Moor. '' It is,'' replied Zoraida. '' '' '' And what good hast thou done thyself, daughter?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>).
<p/>Ask thou that,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``of Lela Marien, for she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) can tell thee better than I.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The Moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous quickness he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) flung himself headforemost into the sea, where no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) would have been drowned had not the long and full dress he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) wore held him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) up for a little on the surface of the water.
<p/>Zoraida cried aloud to us to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>), and we all hastened to help, and seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) robe we drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) in half drowned and insensible, at which Zoraida was in such distress that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) wept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) as piteously and bitterly as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) were already dead.
<p/>We turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) face and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) voided a great quantity of water, and at the end of two hours came to himself.
<p/>Meanwhile, the wind having changed we were compelled to head for the land, and ply our oars to avoid being driven on shore; but it was our good fortune to reach a creek that lies on one side of a small promontory or cape, called by the Moors that of the <div class="bookquote">``Cava rumia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Moors</b></font>)</div>which in our language means <div class="bookquote">``the wicked Christian woman;''  (<font color='red'><b>the Moors</b></font>)</div>for it is a tradition among them that La Cava, through whom Spain was lost, lies buried at that spot; <div class="bookquote">``cava''  (<font color='red'><b>La Cava</b></font>)</div>in their language meaning <div class="bookquote">``wicked woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>La Cava</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``rumia''  (<font color='red'><b>La Cava</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Christian;''
 (<font color='red'><b>La Cava</b></font>)</div><p/>For us, however, it was not the resting-place of the wicked woman but a haven of safety for our relief, so much had the sea now got up.
<p/>We posted a look-out on shore, and never let the oars out of our hands, and ate of the stores the renegade had laid in, imploring God and Our Lady with all our hearts to help and protect us, that we might give a happy ending to a beginning so prosperous.
<p/>At the entreaty of Zoraida orders were given to set on shore her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father and the other Moors who were still bound, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) could not endure, nor could her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) tender heart bear to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father in bonds and her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) fellow-countrymen prisoners before her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>We promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) to do this at the moment of departure, for as it was uninhabited we ran no risk in releasing them at that place.
<p/>Our prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by Heaven, for after a while the wind changed in our favour, and made the sea calm, inviting us once more to resume our voyage with a good heart.
<p/>Seeing this we unbound the Moors, and one by one put them on shore, at which they were filled with amazement; but when we came to land Zoraida's father, who had now completely recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) senses, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Why is it, think ye, Christians, that this wicked woman is rejoiced at your giving me my liberty?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>moreover, they count it unlucky to anchor there when necessity compels them, and they never do so otherwise. Think ye
<p/>it is because of the affection she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bears me? Nay verily, it is only because of the hindrance my presence offers to the execution of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) base designs.
<p/>And think not that it is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belief that yours is better than ours that has led her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to change her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) religion; it is only because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knows that immodesty is more freely practised in your country than in ours.
<p/>Then turning to Zoraida, while I and another of the Christians held him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fast by both arms, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should do some mad act, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Infamous girl, misguided maiden, whither in thy blindness and madness art thou going in the hands of these dogs, our natural enemies?
<p/>But seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not likely soon to cease I made haste to put him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) on shore, and thence he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) maledictions and lamentations aloud; calling on Mohammed to pray to Allah to destroy us, to confound us, to make an end of us; and when, in consequence of having made sail, we could no longer hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) said we could see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) did
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Cursed be the hour when I begot thee! Cursed the luxury and indulgence in which I reared thee!'' ; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) plucked out his (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) beard and tore his (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) hair and lay writhing on the ground.
<p/>``Come back, dear daughter, come back to shore; I forgive thee all; let those men have the money, for it is theirs now, and come back to comfort thy sorrowing father, who will yield up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life on this barren strand if thou dost leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>All this Zoraida heard, and heard with sorrow and tears, and all she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) could say in answer was, <div class="bookquote">``Allah grant that Lela Marien, who has made me become a Christian, give thee comfort in thy sorrow, my father.
<p/>Allah knows that I could not do otherwise than I have done, and that these Christians owe nothing to my will; for even had I wished not to accompany them, but remain at home, it would have been impossible for me, so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this purpose, which I feel to be as righteous as to thee, dear father, it seems wicked.
<p/>But once he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice to such a pitch that we were able to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>But neither could her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father hear her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nor we see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said this; and so, while I consoled Zoraida, we turned our attention to our voyage, in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we made sure of finding ourselves off the coast of Spain on the morrow by daybreak.
<p/>But, as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed, without being attended or followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock to it, our fortune, or perhaps the curses which the Moor had hurled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) daughter -LRB-for whatever kind of father they may come from these are always to be dreaded-RRB-, brought it about that when we were now in mid-sea, and the night about three hours spent, as we were running with all sail set and oars lashed, for the favouring breeze saved us the trouble of using them, we saw by the light of the moon, which shone brilliantly, a square-rigged vessel in full sail close to us, luffing up and standing across our course, and so close that we had to strike sail to avoid running foul of her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>), while they too put the helm hard up to let us pass.
<p/>They came to the side of the ship to ask who we were, whither we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked this in French our renegade said, <div class="bookquote">``Let no one answer, for no doubt these are French corsairs who plunder all comers.
<p/>Acting on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone a little ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly they fired two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for with one they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into the sea, and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball into our vessel amidships, staving her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) in completely, but without doing any further damage.
<p/>We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to shout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill.
<p/>They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as many as a dozen Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their matches burning, got into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we were, and that our vessel was going down, they took us in, telling us that this had come to us through our incivility in not giving them an answer.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>renegade</b></font>)</div>Our renegade took the trunk containing Zoraida's wealth and dropped it into the sea without anyone perceiving what he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did.
<p/>In short we went on board with the Frenchmen, who, after having ascertained all they wanted to know about us, rifled us of everything we had, as if they had been our bitterest enemies, and from Zoraida they took even the anklets she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) wore on her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) feet; but the distress they caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) did not distress me so much as the fear I was in that from robbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) rich and precious jewels they would proceed to rob her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) of the most precious jewel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) valued more than all.
<p/>The desires, however, of those people do not go beyond money, but of that their covetousness is insatiable, and on this occasion it was carried to such a pitch that they would have taken even the clothes we wore as captives if they had been worth anything to them.
<p/>It was the advice of some of them to throw us all into the sea wrapped up in a sail; for their purpose was to trade at some of the ports of Spain, giving themselves out as Bretons, and if they brought us alive they would be punished as soon as the robbery was discovered; but the captain -LRB-who was the one who had plundered my beloved Zoraida-RRB- said he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was satisfied with the prize he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had got, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would not touch at any Spanish port, but pass the Straits of Gibraltar by night, or as best he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) could, and make for La Rochelle, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had sailed.
<p/>So they agreed by common consent to give us the skiff belonging to their ship and all we required for the short voyage that remained to us, and this they did the next day on coming in sight of the Spanish coast, with which, and the joy we felt, all our sufferings and miseries were as completely forgotten as if they had never been endured by us, such is the delight of recovering lost liberty.
<p/>It may have been about mid-day when they placed us in the boat, giving us two kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain, moved by I know not what compassion, as the lovely Zoraida was about to embark, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) some forty gold crowns, and would not permit his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) men to take from her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) those same garments which she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) has on now.
<p/>They stood out to sea, steering for the straits; we, without looking to any compass save the land we had before us, set ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so near that
<p/>We got into the boat, returning them thanks for their kindness to us, and showing ourselves grateful rather than indignant. we might easily, we thought, land before the night was far advanced.
<p/>But as the moon did not show that night, and the sky was clouded, and as we knew not whereabouts we were, it did not seem to us a prudent thing to make for the shore, as several of us advised, saying we ought to run ourselves ashore even if it were on rocks and far from any habitation, for in this way we should be relieved from the apprehensions we naturally felt of the prowling vessels of the Tetuan corsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfall and are on the Spanish coast by daybreak, where they commonly take some prize, and then go home to sleep in their own houses.
<p/>But of the conflicting counsels the one which was adopted was that we should approach gradually, and land where we could if the sea were calm enough to permit us.
<p/>This was done, and a little before midnight we drew near to the foot of a huge and lofty mountain, not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space on which to land conveniently.
<p/>We ran our boat up on the sand, and all sprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of joyful satisfaction returned thanks to God our Lord for all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) incomparable goodness to us on our voyage.
<p/>We took out of the boat the provisions it contained, and drew it up on the shore, and then climbed a long way up the mountain, for even there we could not feel easy in our hearts, or persuade ourselves that it was Christian soil that was now under our feet.
<p/>The dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have wished; we completed the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation or any shepherds' huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as we might, neither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could we perceive.
<p/>However, we determined to push on farther, as it could not but be that ere long we must see some one who could tell us where we were.
<p/>But what distressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot over that rough ground; for though I once carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) on my shoulders, she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) was more wearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) would never again allow me to undergo the exertion, and went on very patiently and cheerfully, while I led her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) by the hand.
<p/>We had gone rather less than a quarter of a league when the sound of a little bell fell on our ears,
<p/>a clear proof that there were flocks hard by, and looking about carefully to see if any were within view, we observed a young shepherd tranquilly and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) knife at the foot of a cork tree.
<p/>We called to him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), raising his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) head, sprang nimbly to his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) feet, for, as we afterwards learned, the first who presented themselves to his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) sight were the renegade and Zoraida, and seeing them in Moorish dress he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) imagined that all the Moors of Barbary were upon him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>); and plunging with marvellous swiftness into the thicket in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) began to raise a prodigious outcry, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``The Moors--the Moors have landed!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We were all thrown into perplexity by these cries, not knowing what to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd would raise the country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once to see what was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) Turkish garments and put on a captive's jacket or coat which one of our party gave him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) at once, though he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) himself was reduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) shirt; and so commending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we saw the shepherd take, expecting every moment that the coast-guard would be down upon us.
<p/>Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had not passed when, coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, we perceived some fifty mounted men swiftly approaching us at a hand-gallop.
<p/>As soon as we saw them we stood still, waiting for them; but as they came close and, instead of the Moors they were in quest of, saw a set of poor Christians, they were taken aback, and one of them asked if it could be we who were the cause of the shepherd having raised the call to arms.
<p/>I said <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and as I was about to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) what had occurred, and whence we came and who we were, one of the Christians of our party recognised the horseman who had put the question to us, and before I could say anything more he (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) exclaimed:
<p/>``Thanks be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, if I do not deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malaga unless, indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable to recollect that you, senor, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante, my uncle.
<p/>The Christian captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horseman threw himself off his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying: <div class="bookquote">``Nephew of my soul and life!
<p/>I recognise thee now; and long have I mourned thee as dead, I, and my sister, thy mother, and all thy kin that are still alive, and whom God has been pleased to preserve that they may enjoy the happiness of seeing thee.
<p/>We knew long since that thou wert in Algiers, and from the appearance of thy garments and those of all this company, I conclude that ye have had a miraculous restoration to liberty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as the horsemen understood that we were Christian captives, they dismounted from their horses, and each offered his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to carry us to the city of Velez Malaga, which was a league and a half distant.
<p/>Some of them went to bring the boat to the city, we having told them where we had left it; others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was placed on the horse of the young man's uncle.
<p/>The whole town came out to meet us, for they had by this time heard of our arrival from one who had gone on in advance.
<p/>They were not astonished to see liberated captives or captive Moors, for people on that coast are well used to see both one and the other; but they were astonished at the beauty of Zoraida, which was just then heightened, as well by the exertion of travelling as by joy at finding herself on Christian soil, and relieved of all fear of being lost; for this had brought such a glow upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) face, that unless my affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) were deceiving me, I would venture to say that there was not a more beautiful creature in the world--at least, that I had ever seen.
<p/>We went straight to the church to return thanks to God for the mercies we had received, and when Zoraida entered it she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) said there were faces there like Lela Marien's.
<p/>We told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) they were her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) images; and as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could the renegade explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) what they meant, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) might adore them as if each of them were the very same Lela Marien that had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>), having great intelligence and a quick and clear instinct, understood at once all he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marien</b></font>) about them.
<p/>Thence they took us away and distributed us all in different houses in the town; but as for the renegade, Zoraida, and myself, the Christian who came with us brought us to the house of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) parents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune, and treated us with as much kindness as they did their own son.
<p/>We remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, having informed himself of all that was requisite for him (<font color='blue'><b>Velez</b></font>) to do, set out for the city of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the Church through the medium of the Holy Inquisition.
<p/>The other released captives took their departures, each the way that seemed best to him (<font color='blue'><b>Velez</b></font>), and Zoraida and I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns which the courtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of which I bought the beast on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) rides; and, I for the present attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) father and squire and not as her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) husband, we are now going to ascertain if my father is living, or if any of my brothers has had better fortune than mine has been; though, as Heaven has made me the companion of Zoraida
<p/>To arms, to arms! '' <div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the young man, <div class="bookquote">``and by-and-by we will tell you all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>, I think no other lot could be assigned to me, however happy, that I would rather have.
<p/>The patience with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) endures the hardships that poverty brings with it, and the eagerness she (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) shows to become a Christian, are such that they fill me with admiration, and bind me to serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) all my life; though the happiness I feel in seeing myself hers, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) mine, is disturbed and marred by not knowing whether I shall find any corner to shelter her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) in my own country, or whether time and death may not have made such changes in the fortunes and lives of my father and brothers, that I shall hardly find anyone who knows me, if they are not alive.
<p/>I have no more of my story to tell you, gentlemen; whether it be an interesting or a curious one let your better judgments decide; all I can say is I would gladly have told it to you more briefly; although my fear of wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance.
<p/>With these words the captive held his (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) peace, and Don Fernando said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``In truth, captain, the manner in which you have related this remarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and strangeness of the matter.
<p/>The whole story is curious and uncommon, and abounds with incidents that fill the hearers with wonder and astonishment; and so great is the pleasure we have found in listening to it that we should be glad if it were to begin again, even though to-morrow were to find us still occupied with the same tale.
<p/>And while he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) said this Cardenio and the rest of them offered to be of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) in any way that lay in their power, and in words and language so kindly and sincere that the captain was much gratified by their good-will.
<p/>In particular Don Fernando offered, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) would go back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptism of Zoraida, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) own part to provide him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) with the means of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) appearance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) own country with the credit and comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) was entitled to.
<p/>CHAPTER XLII. WHICH TREATS OF WHAT FURTHER TOOK PLACE IN THE INN, AND OF SEVERAL OTHER THINGS WORTH KNOWING ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>For all this the captive returned thanks very courteously, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) would not accept any of their generous offers.
<p/>By this time night closed in, and as it did, there came up to the inn a coach attended by some men on horseback, who demanded accommodation; to which the landlady replied that there was not a hand's breadth of the whole inn unoccupied.
<p/>Still, for all that,'' said one of those who had entered on horseback, ``room must be found for his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) lordship the Judge here.
<p/>At this name the landlady was taken aback, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, the fact is I have no beds; but if his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) lordship the Judge carries one with him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), as no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) does, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) come in and welcome; for my husband
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very good, so be it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>said the squire; but in the meantime a man had got out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and post he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) held, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) wore showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was, as his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) servant said, a Judge of appeal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) led by the hand a young girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen years of age, and of such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so graceful, that all were filled with admiration when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appearance, and but for having seen Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida, who were there in the inn, they would have fancied that a beauty like that of this maiden's would have been hard to find.
<p/>Don Quixote was present at the entrance of the Judge with the young lady, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Your worship may with confidence enter and take your ease in this castle; for though the accommodation be scanty and poor, there are no quarters so cramped or inconvenient that they cannot make room for arms and letters; above all if arms and letters have beauty for a guide and leader, as letters represented by your worship have in this fair maiden, to whom not only ought castles to throw themselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks should rend themselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves down to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) a reception.
<p/>Enter, your worship, I say, into this paradise, for here you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven your worship brings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme excellence, and beauty in its highest perfection.
<p/>The Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) figure than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) talk; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) could find words to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had a fresh surprise, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) saw opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) Luscinda, Dorothea, and Zoraida, who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the young lady, had come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the curate, however, greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) in a more intelligible and polished style.
<p/>In short, the Judge made his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) entrance in a state of bewilderment, as well with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) saw as what he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) heard, and the fair ladies of the inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcome.
<p/>On the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) could perceive that all who were there were people of quality; but with the figure, countenance, and bearing of Don Quixote he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wits' end; and all civilities having been exchanged, and the accommodation of the inn inquired into, it was settled, as it had been before settled, that all the women should retire to the garret that has been already mentioned, and that the men should remain outside as if to guard them; the Judge, therefore, was very well pleased to allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) daughter, for such the damsel was, to go with the ladies, which she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) did very willingly; and with part of the host's narrow bed and half of what the Judge had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), they made a more comfortable arrangement for the night than they had expected.
<p/>The captive, whose heart had leaped within him (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) saw the Judge, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) somehow that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) brother, asked one of the servants who accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) what his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) name was, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) knew from what part of the country he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) came.
<p/>The servant replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was called the Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had heard it said he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) came from a village in the mountains of Leon.
<p/>From this statement, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) himself had seen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) felt convinced that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) brother who had adopted letters by his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) father's advice; and excited and rejoiced, he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) called Don Fernando and Cardenio and the curate aside, and told them how the matter stood, assuring them that the judge was his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) brother.
<p/>The servant had further informed him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was now going to the Indies with the appointment of Judge of the Supreme Court of Mexico; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had learned, likewise, that the young lady was his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) daughter, whose mother had died in giving birth to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) with the daughter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) asked their advice as to what means he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) should adopt to make himself known, or to ascertain beforehand whether, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had made himself known, his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) brother, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) so poor, would be ashamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), or would receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) with a warm heart.
<p/>Leave it to me to find out that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the curate; <div class="bookquote">``though there is no reason for supposing, senor captain, that you will not be kindly received, because the worth and wisdom that your brother's bearing shows him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to possess do not make it likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will prove haughty or insensible, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will not know how to estimate the accidents of fortune at their proper value.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>'' and I will give up our room to accommodate his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) worship. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>said the captain, <div class="bookquote">``I would not make myself known abruptly, but in some indirect way.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have told you already,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, ``that I will manage it in a way to satisfy us all.
<p/>By this time supper was ready, and they all took their seats at the table, except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves in their own room.
<p/>In the middle of supper the curate said: <div class="bookquote">``I had a comrade of your worship's name, Senor Judge, in Constantinople, where I was a captive for several years, and that same comrade was one of the stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole Spanish infantry; but he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) had as large a share of misfortune as he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) had of gallantry and courage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,'' replied the curate, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was born in a village in the mountains of Leon; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) mentioned a circumstance connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) brothers which, had it not been told me by so truthful a man as he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) was, I should have set down as one of those fables the old women tell over the fire in winter; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) father had divided his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) property among his (<font color='blue'><b>Leon</b></font>) three sons and had addressed words of advice to them sounder than any of Cato's.
<p/>But I can say this much, that the choice he (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) made of going to the wars was attended with such success, that by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) gallant conduct and courage, and without any help save his (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) own merit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) rose in a few years to be captain of infantry, and to see himself on the high-road and in position to be given the command of a corps before long; but Fortune was against him (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>), for where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) might have expected her (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) favour he (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) lost it, and with it his (<font color='blue'><b>Cato</b></font>) liberty, on that glorious day when so many recovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>'' And how was the captain called, senor?'' asked the Judge. '' I lost mine at the Goletta, and after a variety of adventures we found ourselves comrades at Constantinople.
<p/>Thence he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) went to Algiers, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) met with one of the most extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the world.
<p/>Here the curate went on to relate briefly his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) brother's adventure with Zoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) never before had been so much of a hearer.
<p/>The curate, however, only went so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were in the boat, and the poverty and distress in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) comrade and the fair Moor were left, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had not been able to learn what became of them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to France by the Frenchmen.
<p/>The captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all the curate said, and watching every movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) brother, who, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) perceived the curate had made an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) story, gave a deep sigh and said with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) eyes full of tears, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, senor, if you only knew what news you have given me and how it comes home to me, making me show how I feel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all my worldly wisdom and self-restraint!
<p/>That brave captain that you speak of is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than my other brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of arms, which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as your comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was telling you.
<p/>I followed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised me to the position in which you see me.
<p/>My second brother is in Peru, so wealthy that with what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has sent to my father and to me he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has fully repaid the portion he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and has even furnished my father's hands with the means of gratifying his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) natural generosity, while I too have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming and creditable fashion, and so to attain my present standing.
<p/>My father is still alive, though dying with anxiety to hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eldest son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) prays God unceasingly that death may not close his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes until he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has looked upon those of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) son; but with regard to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) what surprises me is, that having so much common sense as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should have neglected to give any intelligence about himself, either in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) troubles and sufferings, or in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) prosperity, for if his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father or any of us had known of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) condition he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) need not have waited for that miracle of the reed to obtain his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ransom; but what now disquiets me is the uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to liberty, or murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to hide the robbery.
<p/>All this will make me continue my journey, not with the satisfaction in which I began it, but in the deepest melancholy and sadness.
<p/>that I only knew where thou art now, and I would hasten to seek thee out and deliver thee from thy sufferings, though it were to cost me suffering myself!
<p/>, even wert thou the deepest dungeon of Barbary; for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wealth and my brother's and mine would rescue thee thence!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>Oh dear brother! Oh that I could bring news to our old father that thou art alive Oh beautiful and generous Zoraida, that I could repay thy good goodness to a brother!
<p/>That I could be present at the new birth of thy soul, and at thy bridal that would give us all such happiness!
<p/>All this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had received of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) brother that all who heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) shared in it, showing their sympathy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) sorrow.
<p/>The curate, seeing, then, how well he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had succeeded in carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) purpose and the captain's wishes, had no desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) rose from the table and going into the room where Zoraida was he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) by the hand, Luscinda, Dorothea, and the Judge's daughter following her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>).
<p/>The captain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where the Judge and the other gentlemen were and said, <div class="bookquote">``Let your tears cease to flow, Senor Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire, for you have before you your worthy brother and your good sister-in-law.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) whom you see here is the Captain Viedma, and this is the fair Moor who has been so good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>).
<p/>The Frenchmen I told you of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you may show the generosity of your kind heart.
<p/>The captain ran to embrace his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) brother, who placed both hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) breast so as to have a good look at him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), holding him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) a little way off but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had fully recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) arms so closely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those present could not but join in them.
<p/>The words the brothers exchanged, the emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less put down in writing.
<p/>They told each other in a few words the events of their lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all its strength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) possessed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Zoraida</b></font>) disposal; then he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) daughter embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and the fair Christian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye.
<p/>And there was Don Quixote observing all these strange proceedings attentively without uttering a word, and attributing the whole to chimeras of knight-errantry.
<p/>Then they agreed that the captain and Zoraida should return with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) brother to Seville, and send news to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) father of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) having been delivered and found, so as to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to come and be present at the marriage and baptism of Zoraida, for it was impossible for the Judge to put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) journey, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was informed that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from Seville for New Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a great inconvenience to him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>).
<p/>In short, everybody was well pleased and glad at the captive's good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night were past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it.
<p/>Don Quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the great treasure of beauty the castle contained.
<p/>Those who understood him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) returned him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) thanks for this service, and they gave the Judge an account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) extraordinary humour, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was not a little amused.
<p/>Sancho Panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to rest; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) of all was the one that made himself most comfortable, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) stretched himself on the trappings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ass, which, as will be told farther on, cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) so dear.
<p/>The ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others having disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don Quixote sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had promised.
<p/>It happened, however, that a little before the approach of dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it forced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea, who had been awake, and by whose side Dona Clara de Viedma, for so the Judge's daughter was called, lay sleeping.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>'' No one could imagine who it was that sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument.
<p/>At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were all attention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, ``Listen, whoever is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer's voice that enchants as it chants.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are listening to it already, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/DOROTHEA</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea; on which Cardenio went away; and Dorothea, giving all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) attention to it, made out the words of the song to be these: CHAPTER XLIII.
<p/>'' WHEREIN IS RELATED THE PLEASANT STORY OF THE MULETEER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER STRANGE THINGS THAT CAME TO PASS IN THE INN
<p/>Ah me, Love's mariner am I On Love's deep ocean sailing ; I know not where the haven lies, I dare not hope to gain it.
<p/>One solitary distant star Is all I have to guide me, A brighter orb than those of old That Palinurus lighted.
<p/>And vaguely drifting am I borne, I know not where it leads me; I fix my gaze on it alone, Of all beside it heedless.
<p/>But over-cautious prudery, And coyness cold and cruel, When most I need it, these, like clouds, Its longed-for light refuse me.
<p/>Bright star, goal of my yearning eyes As thou above me beamest, When thou shalt hide thee from my sight I'll know that death is near me.
<p/>The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair to let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) from side to side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) woke her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), saying: <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest have the pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps, in all thy life.
<p/>Clara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what Dorothea said, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) what it was; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) repeated what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had said, and Clara became attentive at once; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had hardly heard two lines, as the singer continued, when a strange trembling seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) were suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) arms round Dorothea
<p/>The greatest kindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as neither to see or hear that unhappy musician.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, dear lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>What art thou talking about, child?'' said Dorothea.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) is the lord of many places,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dona Clara/Clara</b></font>)</div>replied Clara, ``and that one in my heart which he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) holds so firmly shall never be taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>), unless he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) be willing to surrender it.
<p/>Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed to be far beyond such experience of life as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tender years gave any promise of, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``You speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Senora Clara; explain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are saying about hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you?
<p/>But do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I get from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports, for I perceive he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>), in Heaven's name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dona Clara/Clara</b></font>)</div>returned Clara; and not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) stopped both ears with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) hands, at which Dorothea was again surprised; but turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) attention to the song she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) found that it ran in this fashion:
<p/>'' Why, they say this singer is a muleteer!'' '' Sweet Hope, my stay, That onward to the goal of thy intent
<p/>Dost make thy way, Heedless of hindrance or impediment, Have thou no fear If at each step thou findest death is near.
<p/>No victory, No joy of triumph doth the faint heart know; Unblest is he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) That a bold front to Fortune dares not show, But soul and sense
<p/>If Love his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) wares Do dearly sell, his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) right must be contest; What gold compares With that whereon his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) stamp he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) hath imprest?
<p/>In bondage yieldeth up to indolence. And all men know What costeth little that we rate but low. Love resolute Knows not the word <div class="bookquote">``impossibility;
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And though my suit Beset by endless obstacles I see, Yet no despair Shall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there.
<p/>Here the voice ceased and Clara's sobs began afresh, all which excited Dorothea's curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so sweet and weeping so bitter, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) again asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) what it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was going to say before.
<p/>On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>), winding her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) arms tightly round Dorothea put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mouth so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could speak without fear of being heard by anyone else, and said: <div class="bookquote">``This singer, dear senora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord of two villages, who lives opposite my father's house at Madrid; and though my father had curtains to the windows of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house in winter, and lattice-work in summer, in some way--I know not how--this gentleman, who was pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) studies, saw me, whether in church or elsewhere, I cannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave me to know it from the windows of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) house, with so many signs and tears that I was forced to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and even to love him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), without knowing what it was he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wanted of me.
<p/>One of the signs he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) used to make me was to link one hand in the other, to show me he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wished to marry me; and though I should have been glad if that could be, being alone and motherless
<p/>I knew not whom to open my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) no favour, except when my father, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too, were from home, to raise the curtain or the lattice a little and let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) see me plainly, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would show such delight that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were going mad.
<p/>Meanwhile the time for my father's departure arrived, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) became aware of, but not from me, for I had never been able to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fell sick, of grief I believe, and so the day we were going away I could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to take farewell of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), were it only with the eyes.
<p/>But after we had been two days on the road, on entering the posada of a village a day's journey from this, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at the inn door in the dress of a muleteer, and so well disguised, that if I did not carry his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) image graven on my heart it would have been impossible for me to recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>But I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and I was surprised, and glad; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) watched me, unsuspected by my father, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always hides himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) crosses my path on the road, or in the posadas where we halt; and, as I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is, and reflect that for love of me he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) makes this journey on foot in all this hardship, I am ready to die of sorrow; and where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sets foot there I set my eyes.
<p/>I know not with what object he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has come; or how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could have got away from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) beyond measure, having no other heir, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) deserves it, as you will perceive when you see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>for I have heard them say he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a great scholar and poet; and what is more, every time I see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) or hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sing I tremble all over, and am terrified lest my father should recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and come to know of our loves.

<p/>This, dear senora, is all I have to tell you about the musician whose voice has delighted you so much; and from it alone you might easily perceive he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) is no muleteer, but a lord of hearts and towns, as I told you already.''

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) such a mere boy ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Dona Clara spoke. ''
<p/>The only persons not asleep were the landlady's daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) servant Maritornes, who, knowing the weak point of Don Quixote's humour, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on horseback, resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), or at any rate to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) nonsense.
<p/>As it so happened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwards except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through which they used to throw out the straw.
<p/>At this hole the two demi-damsels posted themselves, and observed Don Quixote on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pike and from time to time sending forth such deep and doleful sighs, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seemed to pluck up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) soul by the roots with each of them; and they could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), too, saying in a soft, tender, loving tone,
<p/>``Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, perfection of all beauty, summit and crown of discretion, treasure house of grace, depositary of virtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good, honourable, and delectable in this world!
<p/>Art thou, perchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own free will hath exposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee?
<p/>With this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all through the inn. What is thy grace doing now? Give me tidings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>),
<p/>Perhaps at this moment, envious of hers, thou art regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>), either as she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) paces to and fro some gallery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) sumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony, meditating how, whilst preserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) purity and greatness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) may mitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) sake, what glory should recompense my sufferings, what repose my toil, and lastly what death my life, and what reward my services?
<p/>And thou, oh sun, that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise betimes and come forth to see my lady; when thou seest her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
<p/>I entreat of thee to salute her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on my behalf: but have a care, when thou shalt see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and salute her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), that thou kiss not her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face; for I shall be more jealous of thee than thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that made thee sweat and run so on the plains of Thessaly, or on the banks of the Peneus -LRB-for I do not exactly recollect where it was thou
<p/>Don Quixote had got so far in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pathetic speech when the landlady's daughter began to signal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), saying, ``Senor, come over here, please.
<p/>At these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head and saw by the light of the moon, which then was in its full splendour, that some one was calling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to be a window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately suggested itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) imagination that, as on the former occasion, the fair damsel, the daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), was once more endeavouring to win his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) affections; and with this idea, not to show himself discourteous, or ungrateful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) turned Rocinante's head and approached the hole, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) perceived the two wenches he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your thoughts of love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a return can be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle birth, for which you must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapable of submission to any other than her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whom, the first moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made absolute mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) soul.
<p/>Forgive me, noble lady, and retire to your apartment, and do not, by any further declaration of your passion, compel me to show myself more ungrateful; and if, of the love you bear me, you should find that there is anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you, provided it be not love itself, demand it of me; for I swear to you by that sweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant, though it be that you require of me a lock of Medusa's hair, which was all snakes, or even the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>oh luminary of the three faces! didst run on that occasion-RRB- in thy jealousy and love. '' '' '' My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,'' said Maritornes at this.
<p/>Only one of your fair hands,'' said Maritornes, ``to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to vent over it the great passion which has brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to this loophole, so much to the risk of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) honour; for if the lord her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) father had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), the least slice he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would cut off her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would be her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) ear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see that tried,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had better beware of that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) does not want to meet the most disastrous end that ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs of a love-stricken daughter.
<p/>Maritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had asked, and making up her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mind what to do, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) got down from the hole and went into the stable, where she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) took the halter of Sancho Panza's ass, and in all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had planted himself standing on Rocinante's saddle in order to reach the grated window where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of the evil-doers of the earth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand of woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of my entire body.
<p/>I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that you may observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of the muscles, the breadth and capacity of the veins, whence you may infer what must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we shall see presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maritornes</b></font>)</div>said Maritornes, and making a running knot on the halter, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed it over his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) wrist and coming down from the hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw-loft.
<p/>Don Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wrist, exclaimed, ``Your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat it not so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution has given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part; remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so cruelly.
<p/>But there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote's, for as soon as Maritornes had tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>)
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and the other made off, ready to die with laughing, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fastened in such a way that it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to release himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was, as has been said, standing on Rocinante, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm passed through the hole and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wrist tied to the bolt of the door, and in mighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinante were to stir one side or the other; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not dare to make the least movement, although from the patience and imperturbable disposition of Rocinante, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had good reason to expect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would stand without budging for a whole century.
<p/>Finding himself fast, then, and that the ladies had retired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began to fancy that all this was done by enchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same castle that enchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) cursed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) heart his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the castle again, after having come off so badly the first time; it being a settled point with knights-errant that when they have tried an adventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is a sign that it is not reserved for them but for others, and that therefore they need not try it again.
<p/>Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) arm to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) could release himself, but it had been made so fast that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) efforts were in vain.
<p/>It is true he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) pulled it gently lest Rocinante should move, but try as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) might to seat himself in the saddle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) had nothing for it but to stand upright or pull his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) hand off.
<p/>Then it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) wished for the sword of Amadis, against which no enchantment whatever had any power; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) ill fortune; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) magnified the loss the world would sustain by his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) absence while he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) remained there enchanted, for that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was beyond all doubt; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) once more took to thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) beloved Dulcinea del Toboso; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) called to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) worthy squire Sancho Panza, who, buried in sleep and stretched upon the pack-saddle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) ass, was oblivious, at that moment, of the mother that bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>); then he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) called upon the sages Lirgandeo and Alquife to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) aid; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) invoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) good friend Urganda to succour him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>); and then, at last, morning found him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was bellowing like a bull, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) had no hope that day would bring any relief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) suffering, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) believed would last for ever, inasmuch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was enchanted; and of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was convinced by seeing that Rocinante never stirred, much or little, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) felt persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) horse were to remain in this state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until the malign influence of the stars was overpast, or until some other more sage enchanter should disenchant him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had hardly begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback, well equipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their saddle-bows.
<p/>They called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn, which was still shut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was, did not forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and imperious tone, <div class="bookquote">``Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no right to knock at the gates of this castle; for it is plain enough that they who are within are either asleep, or else are not in the habit of throwing open the fortress until the sun's rays are spread over the whole surface of the earth.
<p/>Withdraw to a distance, and wait till it is broad daylight, and then we shall see whether it will be proper or not to open to you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>sentinel</b></font>)</div>What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?'' replied Don Quixote. '' '' '' '' '' '' What the devil fortress or castle is this,'' said one, <div class="bookquote">``to make us stand on such ceremony?
<p/>If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us; we are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we are in haste.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>devil</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' I don't know what you look like,'' replied the other;
<p/>A castle it is,'' returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``nay, more, one of the best in this whole province, and it has within it people who have had the sceptre in the hand and the crown on the head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be better if it were the other way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller sceptre crown</b></font>)</div>said the traveller, ``the sceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, may be there is within some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to have those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as this, and where such silence is kept, I do not believe any people entitled to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I know that you are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``You know but little of the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote, ``since you are ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry.
<p/>But the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with Don Quixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that the host, and not only he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) got up to ask who knocked.
<p/>It happened at this moment that one of the horses of the four who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante, who melancholy, dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless, supporting his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sorely stretched master; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was, after all, flesh, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) were made of wood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not help giving way and in return smelling the one who had come to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) attentions.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had hardly moved at all when Don Quixote lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) footing; and slipping off the saddle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have come to the ground, but for being suspended by the arm, which caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) such agony that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) believed either his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wrist would be cut through or his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm torn off; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hung so near the ground that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could just touch it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet, which was all the worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); for, finding how little was wanted to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to plant his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet firmly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) struggled and stretched himself as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could to gain a footing; just like those undergoing the torture of the strappado, when they are fixed at <div class="bookquote">``touch and no touch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>who aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to stretch themselves, deceived by the hope which makes them fancy that with a very little more they will reach the ground.
<p/>So loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlord opening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran to see who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>), untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and down he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers, who approaching asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what was the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shouted so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) without replying a word took the rope off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wrist, and rising to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a half-gallop exclaiming: ``Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided my lady
<p/>the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the lie, challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and defy him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to single combat.
<p/>The newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote; but the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was, and not to mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) senses.
<p/>They then asked the landlord if by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn, one dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an appearance, describing that of Dona Clara's lover.
<p/>The landlord replied that there were so many people in the inn he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had not noticed the person they were inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which the Judge had come, said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) is here no doubt, for this is the coach he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) is following: let one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>); or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the inn, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) should escape over the wall of the yard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Judge</b></font>)</div><p/>So be it,'' said another; and while two of them went in, one remained at the gate and the other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which, the landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all these precautions, though he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) understood they were looking for the youth whose description they had given him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>).
<p/>It was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as in consequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and up, but particularly Dona Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to sleep
<p/>but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lover so near her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), the other from curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>).
<p/>Don Quixote, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) or replied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had plighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) word and faith not to involve himself in any until he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had made an end of the one to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was pledged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have attacked the whole of them, and would have made them return an answer in spite of themselves.
<p/>But considering that it would not become him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), nor be right, to begin any new emprise until he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had established Micomicona in her (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) kingdom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was constrained to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the proceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thought of anyone coming in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), much less finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>The man laid hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the arm, saying, ``It becomes you well indeed, Senor Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed in which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you.
<p/>The youth rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) who held him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>), but presently recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) father's servants, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) was so taken aback that for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) could not find or utter a word; while the servant went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``There is nothing for it now, Senor Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless it is your wish that my lord, your father, should take his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) departure for the other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is in at your absence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/>'' CHAPTER XLIV. IN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURES OF THE INN '' '' '' '' But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress?'' said Don Luis.
<p/>It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,'' answered the servant, <div class="bookquote">``that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) saw your father suffer on missing you; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) therefore despatched four of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) servants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, better pleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Luis/Senor Don Luis</b></font>)</div>returned Don Luis. '' What can you please or heaven order,'' said the other, ``except to agree to go back?
<p/>All this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at whose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) went to report what had taken place to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this time dressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth as <div class="bookquote">``Don,''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>and what words had passed, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) father, which the youth was unwilling to do.
<p/>With this, and what they already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), they all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) was, and even to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) if it was attempted to employ force against him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>); so they hastened to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) was still talking and arguing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) servant.
<p/>Dorothea at this instant came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) room, followed by Dona Clara all in a tremor; and calling Cardenio aside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) in a few words the story of the musician and Dona Clara, and he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) at the same time told her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) what had happened, how his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) father's servants had come in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>); but in telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) so, he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) did not speak low enough but that Dona Clara heard what he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) said, at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was so much agitated that had not Dorothea hastened to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have fallen to the ground.
<p/>Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) would endeavour to make the whole matter right, and they did as he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) desired.
<p/>All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>), urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) to return and console his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) father at once and without a moment's delay.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) could not do so on any account until he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) had concluded some business in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) life, honour, and heart were at stake.
<p/>The servants pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>), saying that most certainly they would not return without him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>), and that they would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) away whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) liked it or not.
<p/>You shall not do that,'' replied Don Luis, <div class="bookquote">``unless you take me dead; though however you take me, it will be without life.
<p/>By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) companions, the Judge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) now considered there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer.
<p/>Cardenio being already acquainted with the young man's story, asked the men who wanted to take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away, what object they had in seeking to carry off this youth against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will.
<p/>Our object,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Luis/Senor Don Luis</b></font>)</div>said one of the four, ``is to save the life of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman's disappearance.
<p/>Upon this Don Luis exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``There is no need to make my affairs public here; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none of you shall compel me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Luis/Senor Don Luis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Reason will compel your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, ``and if it has no power over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for, and what it is our duty to do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hear what the whole affair is about,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Judge</b></font>)</div>said the Judge at this; but the man, who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a neighbour of theirs, replied, ``Do you not know this gentleman, Senor Judge?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) is the son of your neighbour, who has run away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) father's house in a dress so unbecoming his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) rank, as your worship may perceive.
<p/>The judge on this looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) more carefully and recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), and embracing him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What folly is this, Senor Don Luis, or what can have been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this way, and in this dress, which so ill becomes your condition?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Tears came into the eyes of the young man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unable to utter a word in reply to the Judge, who told the four servants not to be uneasy, for all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking Don Luis by the hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) aside and asked the reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) having come there.
<p/>But while he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) was questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) they heard a loud outcry at the gate of the inn, the cause of which was that two of the guests who had passed the night there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the four men wanted, had conceived the idea of going off without paying what they owed; but the landlord, who minded his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) own affairs more than other people's, caught them going out of the gate and demanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) reckoning, abusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) drove them to reply with their fists, and so they began to lay on him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) in such a style that the poor man was forced to cry out, and call for help.
<p/>The landlady and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) daughter could see no one more free to give aid than Don Quixote, and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the daughter said, <div class="bookquote">``Sir knight, by the virtue God has given you, help my poor father, for two wicked men are beating him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to a mummy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div>To which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied, <div class="bookquote">``Fair damsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for I am debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought to a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that which I can do for you is what I will now mention: run and tell your father to stand his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ground as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can in this battle, and on no account to allow himself to be vanquished, while I go and request permission of the Princess Micomicona to enable me to succour him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) distress; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) grants it, rest assured I will relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Sinner that I am,'' exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; <div class="bookquote">``before you have got your permission my master will be in the other world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maritornes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me leave, senora, to obtain the permission I speak of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``and if I get it, it will matter very little if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is in the other world; for I will rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thence in spite of all the same world can do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those who shall have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) there that you will be more than moderately satisfied;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and without saying anything more he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went and knelt before Dorothea, requesting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be pleased to grant him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) permission to aid and succour the castellan of that castle, who now stood in grievous jeopardy.
<p/>The princess granted it graciously, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) at once, bracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword, hastened to the inn-gate, where the two guests were still handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) reached the spot he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stopped short and stood still, though Maritornes and the landlady asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hesitated to help their master and husband.
<p/>I hesitate,'' said Don Quixote, ``because it is not lawful for me to draw sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire Sancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) affair and business.
<p/>Thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively exchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord and to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) daughter, who were furious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the hard treatment their master, husband and father was undergoing.
<p/>But let us leave him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) there; for he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will surely find some one to help him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and if not, let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) suffer and hold his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tongue who attempts more than his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) strength allows him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to do; and let us go back fifty paces to see what Don Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) privately as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed.
<p/>To which the youth, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) hand in a way that showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) heart was troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made answer: <div class="bookquote">``Senor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when, through heaven's will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Dona Clara, your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the mistress of my will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no impediment, this very day she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shall become my wife.
<p/>Anything else is impossible. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' For her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) I left my father's house, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) I assumed this disguise, to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whithersoever
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows nothing more of my passion than what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may have learned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes were filled with tears.
<p/>You know already, senor, the wealth and noble birth of my parents, and that I am their sole heir; if this be a sufficient inducement for you to venture to make me completely happy, accept me at once as your son; for if my father, influenced by other objects of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself, time has more power to alter and change things, than human will.
<p/>With this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, after hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at the manner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) heart, as at the position in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) found himself, not knowing what course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected.
<p/>All the answer, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) was to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) mind easy for the present, and arrange with his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) servants not to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) back that day, so that there might be time to consider what was best for all parties.
<p/>Don Luis kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) hands by force, nay, bathed them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) tears, in a way that would have touched a heart of marble, not to say that of the Judge, who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how advantageous the marriage would be to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter; though, were it possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have preferred that it should be brought about with the consent of the father of Don Luis, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) knew looked for a title for his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) son.
<p/>The guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by persuasion and Don Quixote's fair words more than by threats, they had paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting for the end of the conversation with the Judge and their master's decision, when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber, from whom Don Quixote had taken Mambrino's helmet, and Sancho Panza the trappings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ass in exchange for those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) own, should at this instant enter the inn; which said barber, as he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) led his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) ass to the stable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other belonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) saw it he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) knew it, and made bold to attack Sancho, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Ho, sir thief, I have caught you!
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) may go, as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the pole-star. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that you robbed me of.
<p/>Sancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse poured upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the other gave the barber a cuff that bathed his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) teeth in blood.
<p/>The barber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) had made in the pack-saddle; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) raised such an outcry that everyone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant.
<p/>Here, in the name of the king and justice!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``this thief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover my property.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``You lie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my master Don Quixote won these spoils.
<p/>Don Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire's stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time forth he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) reckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a man of mettle, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart resolved to dub him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling sure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>In the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said, ``Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death, and I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass in the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not fit him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day I was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin, never yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.
<p/>At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and interposing between the two, and separating them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) placed the pack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was established, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which this worthy squire lies when he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) calls a basin which was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) in fair war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession.
<p/>With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may tell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to strip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon's steed, and with it adorn his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own
<p/>; I allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) took it; and as to its having been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no explanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' To confirm all which, run, Sancho my son, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Egad, master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``if we have no other proof of our case than what your worship puts forward, Mambrino's helmet is just as much a basin as this good fellow's caparison is a pack-saddle.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do as I bid thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``it cannot be that everything in this castle goes by enchantment. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and when Don Quixote saw it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took hold of it and said: <div class="bookquote">``Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this is a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the order of chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I took from him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), without anything added to or taken from it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no doubt of that,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for from the time my master won it until now he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) has only fought one battle in it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) let loose those unlucky men in chains; and if had not been for this basin-helmet he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would not have come off over well that time, for there was plenty of stone-throwing in that affair.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER XLV. IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO'S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST
<p/>What do you think now, gentlemen,'' said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``of what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div><p/>And whoever says the contrary,'' said Don Quixote, ``I will let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) know he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lies if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is a knight, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is a squire that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lies again a thousand times.
<p/>Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote's humour so thoroughly, took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head to back up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other barber he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Senor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers' arms; and I say-saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments--that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands, not only is no barber's basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate Cardenio Fernando companions</b></font>)</div>said the curate, who saw the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) companions agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), and even the Judge, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis's affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was so taken up with the serious matters he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had on his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings.
<p/>God bless me!'' exclaimed their butt the barber at this; ``is it possible that such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin but a helmet?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' Why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole university, however wise it might be!
<p/>That will do; if this basin is a helmet, why, then the pack-saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this gentleman has said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To me it looks like a pack-saddle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but I have already said that with that question I do not concern myself.
<p/>As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``it is only for Senor Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all these gentlemen and I bow to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) authority.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By God, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``so many strange things have happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have sojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively in reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my belief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment.
<p/>The first time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble, nor did Sancho fare well among certain followers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); and last night I was kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowing how or why I came by such a mishap.
<p/>So that now, for me to come forward to give an opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash decision.
<p/>As regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a helmet I have already given an answer; but as to the question whether this is a pack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give a positive opinion, but will leave it to your worships' better judgment.
<p/>Perhaps as you are not dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of this place have nothing to do with you, and your faculties are unfettered, and you can see things in this castle as they really and truly are, and not as they appear to me.''

<p/>To those who were in the secret of Don Quixote's humour all this afforded great amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it seemed the greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four servants of Don Luis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to three other travellers who had by chance come to the inn, and had the appearance of officers of the Holy Brotherhood, as indeed they were; but the one who above all was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) wits' end, was the barber whose basin, there before his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) very eyes, had been turned into Mambrino's helmet, and whose pack-saddle
<p/>All laughed to see Don Fernando going from one to another collecting the votes, and whispering to them to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) their private opinion whether the treasure over which there had been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison; but after he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said aloud, <div class="bookquote">``The fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired collecting such a number of opinions, for I find that there is not one of whom I ask what I desire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this is the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay, of a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and your ass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have stated and proved your case very badly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>May I never share heaven,'' said the poor barber, <div class="bookquote">``if your worships are not all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to me a pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, `laws go,'-I say no more; and indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had no doubt whatever was about to become a rich caparison for a horse. '' ''
<p/>The simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the absurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed: ``There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) blessing.
<p/>But said one of the four servants, <div class="bookquote">``Unless, indeed, this is a deliberate joke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men so intelligent as those present are, or seem to be, can venture to declare and assert that this is not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as I perceive that they do assert and declare it, I can only come to the conclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is so opposed to the evidence of experience and truth itself
<p/>the people in the world will not make me believe that this is not a barber's basin and that a jackass's pack-saddle.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the servants</b></font>)</div>; for I swear by''--and here he (<font color='blue'><b>jackass</b></font>) rapped out a round oath-<div class="bookquote">``all ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It might easily be a she-ass's,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>observed the curate.
<p/>It is all the same,'' said the servant; ``that is not the point; but whether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.
<p/>On hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood, who had been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) anger and impatience, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``It is a pack-saddle as sure as my father is my father, and whoever has said or will say anything else must be drunk.''

<p/>The pike was shivered in pieces against the ground, and the rest of the officers, seeing their comrade assaulted, raised a shout, calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood.
<p/>The landlord, who was of the fraternity, ran at once to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) staff of office and his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) sword, and ranged himself on the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) comrades; the servants of Don Luis clustered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>), lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) should escape from them in the confusion; the barber, seeing the house turned upside down, once more laid hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) pack-saddle and Sancho did the same; Don Quixote drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword and charged the officers; Don Luis cried out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) servants to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) alone and go and help Don Quixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who were supporting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>); the curate was shouting at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) voice, the landlady was screaming, her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping
<p/>The barber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luis gave one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) servants, who ventured to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) by the arm to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) from escaping, a cuff that bathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) teeth in blood; the Judge took his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was belabouring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) heartily; the landlord raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) voice again calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing but cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps, sword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the midst of all this chaos, complication, and general entanglement, Don Quixote took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had been plunged into the thick of the discord of Agramante's camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn like thunder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cried out: <div class="bookquote">``Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to me as they value their lives!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All paused at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mighty voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went on to say, ``Did I not tell you, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of devils dwelt in it?
<p/>In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with your own eyes how the discord of Agramante's camp has come hither, and been transferred into the midst of us.
<p/>See how they fight, there for the sword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for the helmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes.
<p/>Come then, you, Senor Judge, and you, senor curate; let the one represent King Agramante and the other King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by God Almighty
<p/>it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as we are should slay one another for such trifling cause.
<p/>The officers, who did not understand Don Quixote's mode of speaking, and found themselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their companions, were not to be appeased; the barber was, however, for both his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) beard and his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle; Sancho like a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master; while the four servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw how little they gained by not being so.
<p/>The landlord alone insisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn raised a disturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for the present; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment, and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote's imagination.
<p/>All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the Judge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) to return with them at once; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) was discussing the matter with them, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the curate as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) ought to do in the case, telling them how it stood, and what Don Luis had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>).
<p/>It was agreed at length that Don Fernando should tell the servants of Don Luis who he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) was, and that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) desire that Don Luis should accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) to Andalusia, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) would receive from the marquis his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) brother the welcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) quality entitled him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) to; for, otherwise, it was easy to see from the determination of Don Luis that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) would not return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) father at present, though they tore him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) to pieces.
<p/>On learning the rank of Don Fernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it between themselves that three of them should return to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) father how matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon Don Luis, and not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) until they came back for him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>), or his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) father's orders were known.
<p/>Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the enemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made a fool of, and seeing how little he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had gained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hand once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.
<p/>It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the rank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the contest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some warrants he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) had one against Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason, apprehended.
<p/>Suspecting how it was, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wished to satisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote's features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bosom he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lit upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was in search of, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was not a quick reader, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made out each word he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes on Don Quixote, and went on comparing the description in the warrant with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face, and discovered that beyond all doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was the person described in it.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took the warrant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) left hand and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) right seized Don Quixote by the collar so tightly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to breathe, and shouted aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it in earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested.
<p/>The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true, and that it agreed with Don Quixote's appearance, who, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) part, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown, worked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) joints cracking with rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might, so that had he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) not been helped by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) comrades he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have yielded up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) life ere

<p/>The landlady, when she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) husband engaged in a fresh quarrel, lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) voice afresh, and its note was immediately caught up by Maritornes and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) daughter, calling upon heaven and all present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``By the Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments of this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!
<p/>Don Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual contentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the coat collar, the other the throat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) adversary; for all this, however, the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help, and deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) over bound into their power, as was required for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on whose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber and footpad of the highways.
<p/>The landlord, who had perforce to support his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) brother officers, ran at once to aid them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Don Quixote smiled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard these words, and said very calmly, <div class="bookquote">``Come now, base, ill-born brood; call

<p/>Come now; band, not of officers, but of thieves; footpads with the licence of the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a knight as I am?

<p/>OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY BROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DON QUIXOTE
<p/>While Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) senses, as they might perceive by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) deeds and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) words, and that they need not press the matter any further, for even if they arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) off, they would have to release him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) by-and-by as a madman; to which the holder of the warrant replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had nothing to do with inquiring into Don Quixote's madness, but only to execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) superior's orders, and that once taken they might let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) go three hundred times if they liked.
<p/>For all that,'' said the curate, ``you must not take him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) away this time, nor will he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), it is my opinion, let himself be taken away.
<p/>In short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such mad things, that the officers would have been more mad than he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was if they had not perceived his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) want of wits, and so they thought it best to allow themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between the barber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their altercation with much bitterness.
<p/>In the end they, as officers of justice, settled the question by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not perfectly contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they changed the pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to Mambrino's helmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote's knowing it, paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a full receipt and engagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for evermore, amen.
<p/>These two disputes, which were the most important and gravest, being settled, it only remained for the servants of Don Luis to consent that three of them should return while one was left to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) whither
<p/>Don Fernando desired to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>); and good luck and better fortune, having already begun to solve difficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and warriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bring everything to a happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; which gave Dona Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face just then without seeing the joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Zoraida, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) did not fully comprehend all she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) saw, was grave or gay without knowing why, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) watched and studied the various countenances, but particularly her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) Spaniard's, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) followed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes and clung to with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) soul.
<p/>The gift and compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the landlord's notice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) demanded Don Quixote's reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wine-skins, and the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wine, swearing that neither Rocinante nor Sancho's ass should leave the inn until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had been paid to the very last farthing.
<p/>The curate settled all amicably, and Don Fernando paid; though the Judge had also very readily offered to pay the score; and all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded one of the discord of Agramante's camp, as Don Quixote said, but of the peace and tranquillity of the days of Octavianus: for all which it was the universal opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate, and to the unexampled generosity of Don Fernando.
<p/>, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to continue the journey he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had begun, and bring to a close that great adventure for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had been called and chosen; and with this high resolve he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went and knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to utter a word until he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had risen; so to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rose, and said, ``It is a common proverb, fair lady, that `diligence is the mother of good fortune,' and experience has often shown in important affairs that the earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case to a successful termination; but in nothing does this truth show itself more plainly than in war, where quickness and activity forestall the devices of the enemy, and win the victory before the foe has time to defend himself.
<p/>All this I say, exalted and esteemed lady, because it seems to me that for us to remain any longer in this castle now is useless, and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find out some day; for who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learned by means of secret and diligent spies that I am going to destroy him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>), and if the opportunity be given him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) may seize it to fortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold, against which all my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little?
<p/>Therefore, lady, let us, as I say, forestall his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) schemes by our activity, and let us depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is only kept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay in encountering your adversary.
<p/>Don Quixote held his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply of the beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a style adapted to Don Quixote's own, replied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in these words, <div class="bookquote">``I give you thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to whom it is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy, display to afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your wishes and mine may be realised, so that you may see that there are women in this world capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it be forthwith, for I have no will
<p/>but yours; dispose of me entirely in accordance with your good pleasure; for she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) who has once entrusted to you the defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) person, and placed in your hands the recovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) dominions, must not think of offering opposition to that which your wisdom may ordain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On, then, in God's name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``for, when a lady humbles herself to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up and placing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on the throne of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ancestors.

<p/>Sancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! master, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears of, begging all good bodies' pardon.
<p/>What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the world, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote.
<p/>If your worship is angry,'' replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I will hold my tongue and leave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say, and what a good servant should tell his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say what thou wilt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote, ``provided thy words be not meant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving like thyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``but that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady, who calls herself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than my mother; for, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not go rubbing noses with one that is here every instant and behind every door.
<p/>Dorothea turned red at Sancho's words, for the truth was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband Don Fernando had now and then, when the others were not looking, gathered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lips some of the reward his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) love had earned, and Sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a queen of a great kingdom; she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>), however, being unable or not caring to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to proceed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``This I say, senor, because, if after we have travelled roads and highways, and passed bad nights and worse days, one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to reap the fruit of our labours, there is no need for me to be in a hurry to saddle Rocinante, put the pad on the ass, or get ready the palfrey; for it will be better for us to stay quiet, and let every jade mind her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spinning, and let us go to dinner.

<p/>Begone, show thyself no more before me under pain of my wrath;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>) knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>) brows, puffed out his (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>) cheeks, gazed around him (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>), and stamped on the ground violently with his (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>) right foot, showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>) heart; and at his (<font color='blue'><b>inventor</b></font>) words and furious gestures
<p/>Sancho was so scared and terrified that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would have been glad if the earth had opened that instant and swallowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) only thought was to turn round and make his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) escape from the angry presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master.
<p/>But the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood Don Quixote's humour, said, to mollify his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wrath, <div class="bookquote">``Be not irritated at the absurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, for perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) did not utter them without cause, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) good sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would bear false witness against anyone.
<p/>We may therefore believe, without any hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this castle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, I say, may possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw so much to the detriment of my modesty.''

<p/>Don Quixote said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was ready to pardon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and the curate went for Sancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees begged for the hand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, who having presented it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to kiss it, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) blessing and said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Sancho my son, thou wilt be convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee, that everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>So it is, I believe,'' said Sancho, ``except the affair of the blanket, which came to pass in reality by ordinary means.
<p/>, I would have avenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could I, nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.
<p/>They were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the landlord gave them a minute account of Sancho's flights, at which they laughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out of countenance had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master once more assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) it was all enchantment.
<p/>For all that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) simplicity never reached so high a pitch that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth, without any deception whatever about it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had been blanketed by beings of flesh and blood, and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master believed and protested.
<p/>The illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as it seemed to them time to depart, they devised a plan so that, without giving Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don Quixote to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona, the curate and the barber might carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) away with them as they proposed, and the curate be able to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) madness in hand at home; and in pursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of an oxcart who happened to be passing that way to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) after this fashion.
<p/>They constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars, large enough to hold Don Quixote comfortably; and then Don Fernando and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) companions, the servants of Don Luis, and the officers of the Brotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directions and advice of the curate, covered their faces and disguised themselves, some in one way, some in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quite different from the persons he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had seen in the castle.
<p/>This done, in profound silence they entered the room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was asleep, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rest after the past frays, and advancing to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was sleeping tranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening, they seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) firmly and bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fast hand and foot, so that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) awoke startled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder at the strange figures he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw before him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) at once gave way to the idea which his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head that all these shapes were phantoms of the enchanted castle, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself was unquestionably enchanted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the curate, the concoctor of the scheme, expected would happen.
<p/>Of all that were there Sancho was the only one who was at once in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) senses and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own proper character, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was within very little of sharing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's infirmity, did not fail to perceive who all these disguised figures were; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not dare to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lips until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw what came of this assault and capture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master; nor did the latter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mishap; which was that bringing in the cage, they shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) up in it and nailed the bars so firmly that they could not be easily burst open.
<p/>They then took him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on their shoulders, and as they passed out of the room an awful voice--as much so as the barber, not he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) of the pack-saddle but the other, was able to make it--was heard to say, <div class="bookquote">``O Knight of the Rueful Countenance, let not this captivity in which thou art placed afflict thee, for this must needs be, for the more speedy accomplishment of the adventure in which thy great heart has engaged thee; the which shall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lion and the white Tobosan dove shall be linked together, having first humbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony.
<p/>And from this marvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world brave whelps that shall rival the ravening claws of their valiant father; and this shall come to pass
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Believe it not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for had it been so ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) swift natural course have twice visited the starry signs.
<p/>And thou, O most noble and obedient squire that ever bore sword at side, beard on face, or nose to smell with, be not dismayed or grieved to see the flower of knight-errantry carried away thus before thy very eyes; for soon, if it so please the Framer of the universe, thou shalt see thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know thyself, and the promises which thy good master has made thee shall not prove false; and I assure thee, on the authority of the sage Mentironiana, that thy wages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season.
<p/>Follow then the footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedient that thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and as it is not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return to that place I wot of;'' and as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brought the prophecy to a close he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a soft tone, that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined to take what they heard seriously.
<p/>Don Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) at once comprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) beloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed the whelps, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and being thoroughly and firmly persuaded of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) voice, and with a deep sigh exclaimed,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh thou, whoever thou art, who hast foretold me so much good, I implore of thee that on my part thou entreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) leave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now carrying me away, ere I see fulfilled promises so joyful and incomparable as those which have been now made me; for, let this but come to pass, and I shall glory in the pains of my prison, find comfort in these chains
<p/>wherewith they bind me, and regard this bed whereon they stretch me, not as a hard battle-field, but as a soft and happy nuptial couch; and touching the consolation of Sancho Panza, my squire
<p/>, I rely upon his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) goodness and rectitude that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) will not desert me in good or evil fortune; for if, by his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) ill luck or mine, it may not happen to be in my power to give him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) the island I have promised, or any equivalent for it, at least his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) wages shall not be lost; for in my will, which is already made, I have declared the sum that shall be paid to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), measured, not by his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) many faithful services, but by the means at my disposal.
<p/>Sancho bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head very respectfully and kissed both his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hands, for, being tied together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not kiss one; and then the apparitions lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XLVII. OF THE STRANGE MANNER IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS CARRIED AWAY ENCHANTED, TOGETHER WITH OTHER REMARKABLE INCIDENTS
<p/>When Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, ``Many grave histories of knights-errant have I read; but never yet have I read, seen, or heard of their carrying off enchanted knights-errant in this fashion, or at the slow pace that these lazy, sluggish animals promise; for they always take them away through the air with marvellous swiftness, enveloped in a dark thick cloud, or on a chariot of fire, or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the kind; but to carry me off like this on an ox-cart!
<p/>But perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take a different course from that of those in days gone by; and it may be, too, that as I am a new knight in the world, and the first to revive the already forgotten calling of knight-adventurers, they may have newly invented other kinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying off the enchanted.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>answered Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``not being as well read as your worship in errant writings; but for all that I venture to say and swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite catholic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>By God, it puzzles me! What thinkest thou of the matter, Sancho my son?'' <div class="bookquote">``Catholic!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' Father of me!
<p/>how can they be Catholic when they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and do this, and bring me to this condition?
<p/>And if thou wouldst prove it, touch them, and feel them, and thou wilt find they have only bodies of air, and no consistency except in appearance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By God, master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I have touched them already; and that devil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh, and another property very different from what I have heard say devils have, for by all accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells; but this one smells of amber half a league off.
<p/>Sancho was here speaking of Don Fernando, who, like a gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) rank, was very likely perfumed as Sancho said.
<p/>Marvel not at that, Sancho my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``for let me tell thee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours about with them, they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or, if they have any smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but of something foul and fetid; and the reason is that as they carry hell with them wherever they go, and can get no ease whatever from their torments, and as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment, it is impossible that they can smell sweet; if, then, this devil thou speakest of seems to thee to smell of amber, either thou art deceiving thyself, or he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is not a devil.
<p/>Such was the conversation that passed between master and man; and Don Fernando and Cardenio, apprehensive of Sancho's making a complete discovery of their scheme, towards which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had already gone some way, resolved to hasten their departure, and calling the landlord aside, they directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to saddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle on Sancho's ass, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did with great alacrity.
<p/>In the meantime the curate had made an arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) village, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) paying them so much a day.
<p/>Cardenio hung the buckler on one side of the bow of Rocinante's saddle and the basin on the other, and by signs commanded Sancho to mount his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass and take Rocinante's bridle, and at each side of the cart he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) placed two officers with their muskets; but before the cart was put in motion, out came the landlady and her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) daughter and Maritornes to bid Don Quixote farewell, pretending to weep with grief at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) misfortune; and to them Don Quixote said: <div class="bookquote">``Weep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those who follow the profession I profess; and if these reverses did not befall me I should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things never happen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in the world thinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these are envied for their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights who compass the destruction of the worthy by base means.
<p/>Nevertheless, virtue is of herself so mighty, that, in spite of all the magic that Zoroaster its first inventor knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) will come victorious out of every trial, and shed her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) light upon the earth as the sun does upon the heavens.
<p/>Forgive me, fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have in aught offended you; for intentionally and wittingly I have never done so to any; and pray to God that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) deliver me from this captivity to which some malevolent enchanter has consigned me; and should I find myself released therefrom, the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in this castle shall be held in memory by me, that I may acknowledge, recognise, and requite them as they deserve.
<p/>While this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don Quixote, the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) companions, to the captain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) brother, and the ladies, now all made happy, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda.
<p/>They all embraced one another, and promised to let each other know how things went with them, and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>), to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fernando</b></font>) what became of Don Quixote, assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that there was nothing that could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) more pleasure than to hear of it, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) too, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) part, would send him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) word of everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would like to know, about his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) marriage, Zoraida's baptism, Don Luis's affair, and Luscinda's return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Luscinda</b></font>) home.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' The curate promised to comply with his (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) request carefully, and they embraced once more, and renewed their promises.
<p/>The landlord approached the curate and handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) some papers, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel of <div class="bookquote">``The Ill-advised Curiosity''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had been found, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) might take them all away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Luis</b></font>) as their owner had not since returned; for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) could not read, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) did not want them himself.
<p/>The curate thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), and opening them he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words, <div class="bookquote">``Novel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>by which he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) perceived that it was a novel, and as that of <div class="bookquote">``The Ill-advised Curiosity''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had been good he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) kept it, intending to read it when he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) had an opportunity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) then mounted and his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the cart.
<p/>The order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner leading it; at each side of it marched the officers of the Brotherhood, as has been said, with their muskets; then followed Sancho Panza on his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ass, leading Rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and the barber on their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and a grave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the oxen.
<p/>Don Quixote was seated in the cage, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hands tied and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet stretched out, leaning against the bars as silent and as patient as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) were a stone statue and not a man of flesh.
<p/>Thus slowly and silently they made, it might be, two leagues, until they reached a valley which the carter thought a convenient place for resting and feeding his (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) oxen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) said so to the curate, but the barber was of opinion that they ought to push on a little farther, as at the other side of a hill which appeared close by he (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) knew there was a valley that had more grass and much better than the one where they proposed to halt; and his (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) advice was taken and they continued their journey.
<p/>Just at that moment the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind them six or seven mounted men, well found and equipped, who soon overtook them, for they were travelling, not at the sluggish, deliberate pace of oxen, but like men who rode canons' mules, and in haste to take their noontide rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a league off.
<p/>The quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteous salutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in fact, a canon of Toledo and master of the others who accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), observing the regular order of the procession, the cart, the officers, Sancho, Rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all Don Quixote caged and confined, could not help asking what was the meaning of carrying the man in that fashion; though, from the badges of the officers, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) already concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be some desperate highwayman or other malefactor whose punishment fell within the jurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood.
<p/>One of the officers to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put the question, replied, <div class="bookquote">``Let the gentleman himself tell you the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going this way, senor, for we do not know.
<p/>Because if you are I will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in my giving myself the trouble of relating them;
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but here the curate and the barber, seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation with Don Quixote, came forward, in order to answer in such a way as to save their stratagem from being discovered.
<p/>The canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, <div class="bookquote">``In truth, brother, I know more about books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando's elements of logic; so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In God's name, then, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``if that be so, I would have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envy and fraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the wicked than loved by the good.
<p/>I am a knight-errant, and not one of those whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) record, but of those who, in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and all the magicians that Persia, or Brahmans
<p/>that India, or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever produced, will place their names in the temple of immortality, to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come, whereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha says,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>observed the curate, <div class="bookquote">``is the truth; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault or sins of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>), but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is odious and valour hateful.
<p/>This, senor, is the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, if you have ever heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) named, whose valiant achievements and mighty deeds shall be written on lasting brass and imperishable marble, notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure them and malice to hide them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>Don Quixote overheard the conversation and said, <div class="bookquote">``Haply, gentlemen, you are versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>When the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty talk in such a strain he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ready to cross himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) astonishment, and could not make out what had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attendants were in the same state of amazement.
<p/>At this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear the conversation, said, in order to make everything plain, <div class="bookquote">``Well, sirs, you may like or dislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matter is, my master, Don Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) full senses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eats and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) drinks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) calls like other men and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had yesterday, before they caged him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>And if that's the case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is enchanted? For I have heard many a one say that enchanted people neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master
<p/>, if you don't stop him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), will talk more than thirty lawyers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Then turning to the curate he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) exclaimed, ``Ah, senor curate, senor curate!
<p/>do you think I don't know you? Do you think I don't guess and see the drift of these new enchantments?
<p/>Well then, I can tell you I know you, for all your face is covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however you may hide your tricks.
<p/>Ill betide the devil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be married to the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at least; for no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my master, him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) of the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my services.
<p/>But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts, that the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel, and that those who were up yesterday are down to-day.
<p/>I am sorry for my wife and children, for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to see their father return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or kingdom, they will see him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) come back a horse-boy.
<p/>I have said all this, senor curate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your ill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not call you to account in another life for making a prisoner of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in this way, and charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don Quixote leaves undone while he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is shut up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trim those lamps there!''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the barber at this; <div class="bookquote">``so you are of the same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho?
<p/>By God, I begin to see that you will have to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) company in the cage, and be enchanted like him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for having caught some of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) humour and chivalry.
<p/>It was an evil hour when you let yourself be got with child by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) promises, and that island you long so much for found its way into your head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not with child by anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho, ``nor am I a man to let myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself.
<p/>Though I am poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I long for an island, other people long for worse.
<p/>Each of us is the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say governor of an island, especially as my master may win so many that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will not know whom to give them to.
<p/>After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and where there is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Mind how you talk, master barber; for shaving is not everything, and there is some difference between Peter and Peter.
<p/>I say this because we all know one another, and it will not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment of my master, God knows the truth; leave it as it is; it only makes it worse to stir it.
<p/>The barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) plain speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should disclose what the curate and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) himself were trying so hard to conceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon to ride on a little in advance, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the mystery of this man in the cage, and other things that would amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>The canon agreed, and going on ahead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) servants, listened with attention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of Don Quixote, given him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) by the curate, who described to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) briefly the beginning and origin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) craze, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the whole story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) adventures up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) being confined in the cage, together with the plan they had of taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) madness.
<p/>The canon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) servants were surprised anew when they heard Don Quixote's strange story, and when it was finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``To tell the truth, senor curate, I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though, led by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more than that.
<p/>And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of the same species as the fables they call the Milesian, nonsensical tales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, exactly the opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the same time.
<p/>And though it may be the chief object of such books to amuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are so full of such monstrous nonsense.
<p/>For the enjoyment the mind feels must come from the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the things that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothing that has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure.
<p/>What beauty, then, or what proportion of the parts to the whole, or of the whole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad of sixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was an almond cake?
<p/>And when they want to give us a picture of a battle, after having told us that there are a million of combatants on the side of the enemy, let the hero of the book be opposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we like it or not, that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) strong arm.
<p/>And then, what shall we say of the facility with which a born queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some unknown wandering knight?
<p/>What mind, that is not wholly barbarous and uncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of knights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind, and will be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of Prester John of the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy never described nor Marco Polo saw?
<p/>And if, in answer to this, I am told that the authors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore are not bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that fiction is all the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more pleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it.
<p/>Plots in fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and be constructed in such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing over difficulties, keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise, interest, divert, and entertain, so that wonder and delight joined may keep pace one with the other; all which he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will fail to effect who shuns verisimilitude and truth to nature, wherein lies the perfection of writing.
<p/>I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in all its numbers, so that the middle agrees with the beginning, and the end with the beginning and middle; on the contrary, they construct them with such a multitude of members that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or monster rather than a well-proportioned figure.
<p/>And besides all this they are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements, licentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix in their battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels, and, in short, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which reason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a worthless breed.
<p/>The curate listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) attentively and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was a man of sound understanding, and that there was good reason in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) said; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) that, being of the same opinion himself, and bearing a grudge to books of chivalry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had burned all Don Quixote's, which were many; and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) an account of the scrutiny he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had made of them, and of those he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had condemned to the flames and those he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had spared, with which the canon was not a little amused, adding that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had said so much in condemnation of these books, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) found one good thing in them, and that was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted intellect for displaying itself; for they presented a wide and spacious field over which the pen might range freely, describing shipwrecks, tempests, combats, battles, portraying a valiant captain with all the qualifications requisite to make one, showing him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) sagacious in foreseeing the wiles of the enemy, eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) soldiers, ripe in counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold in biding his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) time as in pressing the attack; now picturing some sad tragic incident, now some joyful and unexpected event; here a beauteous lady, virtuous, wise, and modest; there a Christian knight, brave and gentle; here a lawless, barbarous braggart; there a courteous prince, gallant and gracious; setting forth the devotion and loyalty of vassals, the greatness and generosity of nobles.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) can set forth the craftiness of Ulysses, the piety of AEneas, the valour of Achilles, the misfortunes of Hector, the treachery of Sinon, the friendship of Euryalus, the generosity of Alexander, the boldness of Caesar, the clemency and truth of Trajan, the fidelity of Zopyrus, the wisdom of Cato, and in short all the faculties that serve to make an illustrious man perfect, now uniting them in one individual, again distributing them among many; and if this be done with charm of style and ingenious invention, aiming at the truth as much as possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) will assuredly weave a web of bright and varied threads that, when finished, will display such perfection and beauty that it will attain the worthiest object any writing can seek, which, as I said before, is to give instruction and pleasure combined; for the unrestricted range of these books enables the author to show his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) powers, epic, lyric, tragic, or comic, and all the moods the sweet and winning arts of poesy and oratory are capable of; for the epic may be written in prose just as well as in verse.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' CHAPTER XLVIII. IN WHICH THE CANON PURSUES THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOKS OF CHIVALRY, WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) WIT
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as you say, senor canon,''  (<font color='red'><b>CANON</b></font>)</div>said the curate; ``and for that reason those who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more censure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the rules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famous in prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I myself, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the canon, <div class="bookquote">``was once tempted to write a book of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to be observed; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheets written; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showed them to persons who were fond of this kind of reading, to learned and intelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but the pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I obtained flattering approval; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with it, as well because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my profession, as because I perceived that the fools are more numerous than the wise; and, though it is better to be praised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish many, I have no mind to submit myself to the stupid judgment of the silly public, to whom the reading of such books falls for the most part.
<p/>But what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of finishing it was an argument I put to myself taken from the plays that are acted now-a-days, which was in this wise: if those that are now in vogue, as well those that are pure invention as those founded on history, are, all or most of them, downright nonsense and things that have neither head nor tail, and yet the public listens to them with delight, and regards and cries them up as perfection when they are so far from it; and if the authors who write them, and the players who act them, say that this is what they must be, for the public wants this and will have nothing else; and that those that go by rule and work out a plot according to the laws of art will only find some half-dozen intelligent people to understand them, while all the rest remain blind to the merit of their composition; and that for themselves it is better to get bread from the many than praise from the few; then my book will fare the same way, after I have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to observe the principles I have spoken of, and I shall be `the tailor of the corner.'
<p/>And though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors that they are mistaken in this notion they have adopted, and that they would attract more people, and get more credit, by producing plays in accordance with the rules of art, than by absurd ones, they are so thoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no argument or evidence can wean them from it.
<p/>I remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, `Tell me, do you not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragedies acted in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which were such that they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and interest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the higher orders, and brought in more money to the performers, these three alone, than thirty of the best that have been since produced?' '' (<font color='red'><b>the actor</b></font>)</div>`No doubt,' replied the actor in question, `you mean the <div class="bookquote">``Isabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>the actor</b></font>)</div>the <div class="bookquote">``Phyllis,''  (<font color='red'><b>the actor</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``Alexandra.
<p/>'' (<font color='red'><b>the actor</b></font>)</div>' ''`Those are the ones I mean,' said I; `and see if they did not observe the principles of art, and if, by observing them, they failed to show their superiority and please all the world; so that the fault does not lie with the public that insists upon nonsense, but with those who don't know how to produce something else.
<p/>The Ingratitude Revenged'' was not nonsense, nor was there any in <div class="bookquote">``The Numantia,''  (<font color='red'><b>some others</b></font>)</div>nor any to be found in <div class="bookquote">``The Merchant Lover,''  (<font color='red'><b>some others</b></font>)</div>nor yet in <div class="bookquote">``The Friendly Fair Foe,''  (<font color='red'><b>some others</b></font>)</div>nor in some others that have been written by certain gifted poets, to their own fame and renown, and to the profit of those that brought them out;' some further remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Lover</b></font>) rather dumbfoundered, but not so satisfied or convinced that I could disabuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Lover</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lover</b></font>) error.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have touched upon a subject, senor canon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>observed the curate here, <div class="bookquote">``that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in vogue at the present day, quite as strong as that which I bear to the books of chivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should be the mirror of human life, the model of manners, and the image of the truth, those which are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense, models of folly, and images of lewdness.
<p/>For what greater nonsense can there be in connection with what we are now discussing than for an infant to appear in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first act, and in the second a grown-up bearded man?
<p/>Or what greater absurdity can there be than putting before us an old man as a swashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey using fine language, a page giving sage advice,
<p/>And then what shall I say of their attention to the time in which the action they represent may or can take place, save that I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe, the second in Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it been in four acts, the fourth would have ended in America, and so it would have been laid in all four quarters of the globe?
<p/>And if truth to life is the main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it possible for any average understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposed to pass in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the principal personage in it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who entered Jerusalem with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey of Bouillon, there being years innumerable between the one and the other?
<p/>or, if the play is based on fiction and historical facts are introduced, or bits of what occurred to different people and at different times mixed up with it, all, not only without any semblance of probability, but with obvious errors that from every point of view are inexcusable?
<p/>And the worst of it is, there are ignorant people who say that this is perfection, and that anything beyond this is affected refinement.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' a king plying as a porter, a princess who is a kitchen-maid? And then if we turn to sacred dramas--what miracles they invent in them!
<p/>And even in secular plays they venture to introduce miracles without any reason or object except that they think some such miracle, or transformation as they call it, will come in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play.
<p/>All this tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of history, nay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for foreigners who scrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarous and ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays we produce.
<p/>Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief object well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to be performed in public
<p/>is to entertain the people with some harmless amusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours which idleness is apt to engender; and that, as this may be attained by any sort of play, good or bad, there is no need to lay down laws, or bind those who write or act them to make them as they ought to be made, since, as I say, the object sought for may be secured by any sort.
<p/>To this I would reply that the same end would be, beyond all comparison, better attained by means of good plays than by those that are not so; for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play, the hearer will come away enlivened by the jests, instructed by the serious parts, full of admiration at the incidents, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wits sharpened by the arguments, warned by the tricks, all the wiser for the examples, inflamed against vice, and in love with virtue; for in all these ways a good play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ever so boorish or dull; and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed with all these qualities will not entertain, satisfy, and please much more than one wanting in them, like the greater number of those which are commonly acted now-a-days.
<p/>Nor are the poets who write them to be blamed for this; for some there are among them who are perfectly well aware of their faults, and know what they ought to do; but as plays have become a salable commodity, they say, and with truth, that the actors will not buy them unless they are after this fashion; and so the poet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the actor who is to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) work.
<p/>And that this is the truth may be seen by the countless plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written, with so much brilliancy, so much grace and gaiety, such polished versification, such choice language, such profound reflections, and in a word, so rich in eloquence and elevation of style, that he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) has filled the world with his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) fame; and yet, in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) desire to suit the taste of the actors, they have not all, as some of them have, come as near perfection as they ought.
<p/>Others write plays with such heedlessness that, after they have been acted, the actors have to fly and abscond, afraid of being punished, as they often have been, for having acted something offensive to some king or other, or insulting to some noble family.
<p/>All which evils, and many more that I say nothing of, would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person at the capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only those produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be acted in Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local magistracy should allow any play to be acted.
<p/>In that case actors would take care to send their plays to the capital, and could act them in safety, and those who write them would be more careful and take more pains with their work, standing in awe of having to submit it to the strict examination of one who understood the matter; and so good plays would be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained; as well the amusement of the people, as the credit of the wits of Spain, the interest and safety of the actors, and the saving of trouble in inflicting punishment on them.
<p/>And if the same or some other person were authorised to examine the newly written books of chivalry, no doubt some would appear with all the perfections you have described, enriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure of eloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before the light of the new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment, not merely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot be always bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful amusement.
<p/>The canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with their conversation, when the barber, coming forward, joined them, and said to the curate, <div class="bookquote">``This is the spot, senor licentiate, that I said was a good one for fresh and plentiful pasture for the oxen, while we take our noontide rest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>And so it seems,'' returned the curate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) told the canon what he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) proposed to do, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) too made up his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) mind to halt with them, attracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes; and to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) had begun to take a fancy, and also to learn more particulars about the doings of Don Quixote, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) desired some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) servants to go on to the inn, which was not far distant, and fetch from it what eatables there might be for the whole party, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant to rest for the afternoon where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was; to which one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) servants replied that the sumpter mule, which by this time ought to have reached the inn, carried provisions enough to make it unnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley.
<p/>What apocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing to one saint the miracles of another! '' '' '' In that case,'' said the canon, ``take all the beasts there, and bring the sumpter mule back.
<p/>While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master without having the curate and the barber, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) suspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don Quixote was placed, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, to ease my conscience I want to tell you the state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that these two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our village and the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in this fashion, out of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doing famous deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you are not enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of.
<p/>And to prove this I want to ask you one thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer, you will be able to lay your finger on the trick, and you will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits.''

<p/>As to what thou sayest, that these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our neighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to be those same persons; but that they are so in reality and
<p/>in fact, believe it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is that, if they look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who have enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy for enchanters to take any form they please, and they may have taken those of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead thee into a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape
<p/>though thou hadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done it to make me uncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence
<p/>this evil comes to me; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the barber and curate of our village are here in company with us, and on the other I find myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that no power on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut me in,
<p/>what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment is of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the histories that deal with knights-errant that have been enchanted?
<p/>So thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what thou sayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk.

<p/>From which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or sleep, or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of-that such persons are enchanted; but not those that have the desire your worship has, and drink when drink is given them, and eat when there is anything to eat, and answer every question that is asked them.''

<p/>I know and feel that I am enchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage, defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need and distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection.

<p/>The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation till they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and the barber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them.
<p/>The carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not enchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire, who begged the curate to allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master to leave the cage for a little; for if they did not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) out, the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) master required.
<p/>The curate understood him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would very gladly comply with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) request, only that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feared his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) master, finding himself at liberty, would take to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) old courses and make off where nobody could ever find him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) again.
<p/>And I also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the canon, ``especially if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gives me his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) word as a knight not to leave us without our consent.
<p/>Don Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, <div class="bookquote">``I give it;-moreover one who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) likes with himself; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who had enchanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) moving from one place for three ages, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) attempted to escape would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back flying.'' (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>--And that being so, they might as well release him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), particularly as it would be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) protested he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless they kept their distance.
<p/>The canon took his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand, tied together as they both were, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) word and promise they unbound him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and rejoiced beyond measure he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was to find himself out of the cage.
<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did was to stretch himself all over, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went to where Rocinante was standing and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a couple of slaps on the haunches said, ``I still trust in God and in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) blessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that we shall soon see ourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thy master on thy back, and I mounted upon thee, following the calling for which God sent me into the world.
<p/>And so saying, accompanied by Sancho, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) withdrew to a retired spot, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came back much relieved and more eager than ever to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) squire's scheme into execution.
<p/>The canon gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), wondering at the extraordinary nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) madness, and that in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) remarks and replies he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should show such excellent sense, and only lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stirrups, as has been already said, when the subject of chivalry was broached.
<p/>And so, moved by compassion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival of the provisions: ``Is it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of books of chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to upset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like, all as far from the truth as falsehood itself is?
<p/>How can there be any human understanding that can persuade itself there ever was all that infinity of Amadises in the world, or all that multitude of famous knights, all those emperors of Trebizond, all those Felixmartes of Hircania, all those palfreys, and damsels-errant, and serpents, and monsters, and giants, and marvellous adventures, and enchantments of every kind, and battles, and prodigious encounters, splendid costumes, love-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll dwarfs, love letters, billings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and, in a word, all that nonsense the books of chivalry contain?
<p/>For myself, I can only say that when I read them, so long as I do not stop to think that they are all lies and frivolity, they give me a certain amount of pleasure; but when I come to consider what they are, I fling the very best of them at the wall, and would fling it into the fire if there were one at hand, as richly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of the range of ordinary toleration, and as founders of new sects and modes of life, and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and accept as truth all the folly they contain.
<p/>And such is their audacity, they even dare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence, as is shown plainly by the way they have served your worship, when they have brought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage and carried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place to place to make money by showing it.
<p/>Come, Senor Don Quixote, have some compassion for yourself, return to the bosom of common sense, and make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon you, employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other reading that may serve to benefit your conscience and add to your honour.
<p/>And if, still led away by your natural bent, you desire to read books of achievements and of chivalry, read the Book of Judges in the Holy Scriptures, for there you will find grand reality, and deeds as true as they are heroic.
<p/>Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a Caesar, Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander, Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura a Diego Garcia de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez de Vargas, Toledo a Garcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose valiant deeds will entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them with delight and wonder.
<p/>Here, Senor Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of your sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history, in love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners, brave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the honour of God, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I am informed, your worship derives your birth.
<p/>Don Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon's words, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had finished, after regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) replied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>):
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship's discourse is intended to persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in the world, and that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous and useless to the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them, and worse in believing them, and still worse in imitating them, when I undertook to follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they set forth; for you deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of Greece, or any other of the knights of whom the books are full.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all exactly as you state it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the canon; to which Don Quixote returned, <div class="bookquote">``You also went on to say that books of this kind had done me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in a cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies, and read other truer books which would afford more pleasure and instruction.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' I will answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) not running away,'' said Sancho. '' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the canon.
<p/>Well then,'' returned Don Quixote, ``to my mind it is you who are the one that is out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wits and enchanted, as you have ventured to utter such blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and accepted as true that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same punishment which you say you inflict on the books that irritate you when you read them.
<p/>For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all the other knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never existed, would be like trying to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that the sun does not yield light, or ice cold, or earth nourishment.
<p/>What wit in the world can persuade another that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of Burgundy is not true, or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible, which happened in the time of Charlemagne?
<p/>For by all that is good it is as true as that it is daylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a lie too that there was a Hector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve Peers of France, or Arthur of England, who still lives
<p/>One might just as well try to make out that the history of Guarino Mezquino, or of the quest of the Holy Grail, is false, or that the loves of Tristram and the Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as well as those of Guinevere and Lancelot, when there are persons who can almost remember having seen the Dame Quintanona, who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain.
<p/>And so true is this, that I recollect a grandmother of mine on the father's side, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) saw any dame in a venerable hood, used to say to me, `Grandson, that one is like Dame Quintanona,' from which I conclude that she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) must have known her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>), or at least had managed to see some portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>).
<p/>Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and the fair Magalona is true, when even to this day may be seen in the king's armoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horse he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) rode through the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a cart?
<p/>And alongside of the pin is Babieca's saddle, and at Roncesvalles there is Roland's horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may infer that there were Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other knights like them, of the sort people commonly call adventurers.
<p/>Or perhaps I shall be told, too, that there was no such knight-errant as the valiant Lusitanian Juan de Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in the city of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres by name, and afterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique de Remesten, coming out of both encounters covered with fame and honour; or adventures and challenges achieved and delivered, also in Burgundy, by the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and Gutierre Quixada -LRB-of whose family I come in the direct male line-RRB-, when they vanquished the sons of the Count of San Polo.
<p/>I shall be told, too, that Don Fernando de Guevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) engaged in combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke of Austria.
<p/>I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Quinones, him (<font color='blue'><b>Quinones</b></font>) of the `Paso,' and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the Castilian knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well as many other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign realms, which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guzman</b></font>) who denies them must be totally wanting in reason and good sense.
<p/>The canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don Quixote uttered, and to see how well acquainted he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was with everything relating or belonging to the achievements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knight-errantry; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said in reply: ``I cannot deny, Senor Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what you say, especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant; and I am willing to grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not disposed to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop Turpin relates of them.
<p/>For the truth of the matter is they were knights chosen by the kings of France, and called `Peers' because they were all equal in worth, rank and prowess -LRB-at least if they were not they ought to have been-RRB-, and it was a kind of religious order like those of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is assumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction and good birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John, or of Alcantara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers, because twelve equals were chosen for that military order.
<p/>That there was a Cid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be no doubt; but that they did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very doubtful.
<p/>In that other matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speak of, and say is near Babieca's saddle in the Armoury, I confess my sin; for I am either so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen the saddle, I have never been able to see the pin, in spite of it being as big as your worship says it is.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``and more by token they say it is inclosed in a sheath of cowhide to keep it from rusting.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>changed into a raven, and is unceasingly looked for in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) kingdom. '' '' '' '' All that may be,'' replied the canon; <div class="bookquote">``but, by the orders I have received, I do not remember seeing it.
<p/>However, granting it is there, that is no reason why I am bound to believe the stories of all those Amadises and of all that multitude of knights they tell us about, nor is it reasonable that a man like your worship, so worthy, and with so many good qualities, and endowed with such a good understanding, should allow himself to be persuaded that such wild crazy things as are written in those absurd books of chivalry are really true.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>CHAPTER L.</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER L. OF THE SHREWD CONTROVERSY WHICH DON QUIXOTE AND THE CANON HELD, TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS ``A good joke, that!
<p/>Books that have been printed with the king's licence, and with the approbation of those to whom they have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and extolled by great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and simple, in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank or condition they may be--that these should be lies!
<p/>And above all when they carry such an appearance of truth with them; for they tell us the father, mother, country, kindred, age, place, and the achievements, step by step, and day by day, performed by such a knight or knights!
<p/>Hush, sir; utter not such blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to act as a sensible man should; only read them, and you will see the pleasure you will derive from them.
<p/>For, come, tell me, can there be anything more delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes and serpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts swimming about in it, while from the middle of the lake there comes a plaintive voice saying: `Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest this dread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath these dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the seven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;' and then the knight, almost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider, without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is exposing himself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) massive armour, commending himself to God and to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lady,
<p/>plunges into the midst of the boiling lake, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) little looks for it, or knows what his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fate is to be, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) finds himself among flowery meadows, with which the Elysian fields are not to be compared.
<p/>The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a strange brilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy trees presents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure, while the ear is soothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless birds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing branches.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid crystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like sifted gold and purest pearls.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) perceives a cunningly wrought fountain of many-coloured jasper and polished marble; here another of rustic fashion where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow mansions of the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled with fragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of varied aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it.
<p/>Suddenly there is presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sight a strong castle or gorgeous palace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of jacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the materials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is still more rare.
<p/>And after having seen all this, what can be more charming than to see how a bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate of the castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to set myself now to depict it as the histories describe it to us, I should never have done; and then how she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) who seems to be the first among them all takes the bold knight who plunged into the boiling lake by the hand, and without addressing a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) leads him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) into the rich palace or castle, and strips him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) as naked as when his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mother bore him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and bathes him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in lukewarm water, and anoints him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) all over with sweet-smelling unguents, and clothes him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in a shirt of the softest sendal, all scented and perfumed, while another damsel comes and throws over his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shoulders a mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, and even more?
<p/>How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all this, they lead him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to another chamber where he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) finds the tables set out in such style that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how they pour out water for his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented flowers; how they seat him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) on an ivory chair; to see how the damsels wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) all in profound silence; how they bring him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) such a variety of dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss which to select; to hear the music that resounds while he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is at table, by whom or whence produced he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) knows not.
<p/>And then when the repast is over and the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair, picking his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) teeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of the others, to enter unexpectedly by the chamber door, and herself by his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) side, and begin to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) what the castle is, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) is held enchanted there, and other things that amaze the knight and astonish the readers who are perusing his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) history.
<p/>But I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered from it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant one reads, it will fill the reader, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) be, with delight and wonder; and take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and you will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise your spirits should they be depressed.
<p/>For myself I can say that since I have been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous, well-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though it be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my faith, senor, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to anyone, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may possess it in the highest degree; and gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as faith without works is dead.
<p/>For this reason I should be glad were fortune soon to offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor, so as to show my heart in doing good to my friends, particularly to this poor Sancho Panza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world; and I would gladly give him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a county I have promised him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) this ever so long, only that I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has not the capacity to govern his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) realm.
<p/>Sancho partly heard these last words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Strive hard you, Senor Don Quixote, to give me that county so often promised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you there will be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, I have heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, paying so much a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government, while the lord, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they pay him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), without troubling himself about anything else.
<p/>That's what I'll do, and not stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once of the whole business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things go their own way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>That, brother Sancho,'' said the canon, <div class="bookquote">``only holds good as far as the enjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must attend to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound judgment come in, and above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for if this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end will always go wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) frustrates the evil designs of the crafty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' returned Don Quixote. '' '' '' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand those philosophies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho Panza; <div class="bookquote">``all I know is I would
<p/>I had the county as soon as I shall know how to govern it; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and I shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>); and being so
<p/>I should please myself, and pleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) has nothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there is an end of it; so let the county come, and God be with you, and let us see one another, as one blind man said to the other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the canon; ``but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of counties.
<p/>To which Don Quixote returned, ``I know not what more there is to be said; I only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis of Gaul, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) squire count of the Insula Firme; and so, without any scruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) is one of the best squires that ever knight-errant had.
<p/>The canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense -LRB-if nonsense be capable of method-RRB- that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression that the deliberate lies of the books he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) read had made upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and lastly he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtain the county his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>By this time the canon's servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch the sumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass of the meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of some trees and made their repast there, that the carter might not be deprived of the advantage of the spot, as has been already said.
<p/>As they were eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a bell that seemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes that were close by, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat, spotted all over black, white, and brown, spring out of the thicket with a goatherd after it, calling to it and uttering the usual cries to make it stop or turn back to the fold.
<p/>The fugitive goat, scared and frightened, ran towards the company as if seeking their protection and then stood still, and the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and began to talk to it as if it were possessed of reason and understanding: <div class="bookquote">``Ah wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have you gone limping all this time?
<p/>I should do as I liked, and doing as I liked ''  (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div>'' What wolves have frightened you, my daughter? Won't you tell me what is the matter, my beauty?
<p/>But what else can it be except that you are a she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and cannot keep quiet? A plague on your humours and the humours of those you take after!
<p/>Come back, come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any rate you will be safe in the fold or with your companions; for if you who ought to keep and lead them, go wandering astray, what will become of them?
<p/>The goatherd's talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon, who said to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``As you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in such a hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female, as you say, she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) will follow her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) natural instinct in spite of all you can do to prevent it.
<p/>Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will soothe your irritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) the loins of a cold rabbit on a fork.
<p/>The goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and then said, ``I should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a simpleton for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but the truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used.
<p/>I am a clown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I can well believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, ``for I know already by experience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds' harbour philosophers.

<p/>To this Don Quixote replied, ``Seeing that this affair has a certain colour of chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you most gladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence they possess and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm, and entertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER LI. WHICH DEALS WITH WHAT THE GOATHERD TOLD THOSE WHO WERE CARRYING OFF DON QUIXOTE Three leagues from this valley
<p/>there is a village which, though small, is one of the richest in all this neighbourhood, and in it there lived a farmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to be so is the natural consequence of being rich, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was even more respected for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) virtue than for the wealth he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had acquired.
<p/>But what made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still more fortunate, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said himself, was having a daughter of such exceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, that everyone who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marvelled at the extraordinary gifts with which heaven and nature had endowed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>As a child she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was beautiful, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was most lovely.
<p/>The fame of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) beauty began to spread abroad through all the villages around--but why do I say the villages around, merely, when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into the halls of royalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who came from all sides to see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as if to see something rare and curious, or some wonder-working image?
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) watched over herself; for there are no locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own modesty.
<p/>The wealth of the father and the beauty of the daughter led many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) for a wife; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a jewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind to which of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) countless suitors he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should entrust her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>I was one among the many who felt a desire so natural, and, as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father knew who I was, and I was of the same town, of pure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich in possessions, I had great hopes of success.
<p/>There was another of the same place and qualifications who also sought her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and this made her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's choice hang in the balance, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt that on either of us his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter would be well bestowed; so to escape from this state of perplexity he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) resolved to refer the matter to Leandra -LRB-for that is the name of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery-RRB-, reflecting that as we were both equal it would be best to leave it to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dear daughter to choose according to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) inclination--a course that is worthy of imitation by all fathers who wish to settle their children in life.
<p/>I do not mean that they ought to leave them to make a choice of what is contemptible and bad, but that they should place before them what is good and then allow them to make a good choice as they please.
<p/>I do not know which Leandra chose; I only know her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) father put us both off with the tender age of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter and vague words that neither bound him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nor dismissed us.
<p/>My rival is called Anselmo and I myself Eugenio--that you may know the names of the personages that figure in this tragedy, the end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to see it must be disastrous.
<p/>About this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, the son of a poor peasant of the same town, the said Vicente having returned from service as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts.
<p/>A captain who chanced to pass that way with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) company had carried him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) off from our village when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was a boy of about twelve years, and now twelve years later the young man came back in a soldier's uniform, arrayed in a thousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine steel chains.
<p/>To-day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in another; but all flimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth.
<p/>can be malice itself, remarked all this, and took note of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finery and jewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had three suits of different colours, with garters and stockings to match; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made so many arrangements and combinations out of them, that if they had not counted them, anyone would have sworn that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made a display of more than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes.
<p/>Do not look upon all this that I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled for or spun out, for they have a great deal to do with the story.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to seat himself on a bench under the great poplar in our plaza, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would keep us all hanging open-mouthed on the stories he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told us of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exploits.
<p/>There was no country on the face of the globe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen, nor battle he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been engaged in; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had killed more Moors than there are in Morocco and Tunis, and fought more single combats, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own account, than Garcilaso, Diego Garcia de Paredes and a thousand others he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) named, and out of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) had come victorious without losing a drop of blood.
<p/>On the other hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) showed marks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) said were gunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions.
<p/>Lastly, with monstrous impudence he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) used to say <div class="bookquote">``you''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) equals and even those who knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) was, and declare that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) arm was his (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) deeds his (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) pedigree, and that being a soldier he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) was as good as the king himself.
<p/>And to add to these swaggering ways he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) was a trifle of a musician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) made it speak; nor did his (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) accomplishments end here, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) was something of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the town he (<font color='blue'><b>Paredes</b></font>) made a ballad a league long.
<p/>This soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca, this bravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched by Leandra from a window of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) house which looked out on the plaza.
<p/>The glitter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roca</b></font>) showy attire took her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) fancy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Roca</b></font>) ballads bewitched her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Roca</b></font>) gave away twenty copies of every one he (<font color='blue'><b>Roca</b></font>) made-RRB-,
<p/>the tales of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roca</b></font>) exploits which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roca</b></font>) told about himself came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) ears; and in short, as the devil no doubt had arranged it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) fell in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) before the presumption of making love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) had suggested itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>); and as in love-affairs none are more easily brought to an issue than those which have the inclination of the lady for an ally, Leandra and Vicente
<p/>came to an understanding without any difficulty; and before any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) numerous suitors had any suspicion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) design, she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) had already carried it into effect, having left the house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) dearly beloved father -LRB-for mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) had none-RRB-, and disappeared from the village with the soldier, who came more triumphantly out of this enterprise than out of any of the large number he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) laid claim to.
<p/>All the village and all who heard of it were amazed at the affair; I was aghast, Anselmo thunderstruck, her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) father full of grief, her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) relations indignant, the authorities all in a ferment, the officers of the Brotherhood in arms.
<p/>They scoured the roads, they searched the woods and all quarters, and at the end of three days they found the flighty Leandra in a mountain cave, stript to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) shift, and robbed of all the money and precious jewels she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) had carried away from home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>).
<p/>They brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) unhappy father, and questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) misfortune, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) confessed without pressure that Vicente de la Roca had deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>), and under promise of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) father's house, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) to the richest and most delightful city in the whole world, which was Naples; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>), ill-advised and deluded, had believed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) father, and handed over all to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) disappeared; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) away to a rugged mountain and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) up in the cave where they had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) said, moreover, that the soldier, without robbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) honour, had taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) had, and made off, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) in the cave, a thing that still further surprised everybody.
<p/>It was not easy for us to credit the young man's continence, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) asserted it with such earnestness that it helped to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) distressed father, who thought nothing of what had been taken since the jewel that once lost can never be recovered had been left to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>The same day that Leandra made her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) appearance her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) father removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) from our sight and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) away to shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) up in a convent in a town near this, in the hope that time may wear away some of the disgrace she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) has incurred.
<p/>Leandra's youth furnished an excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) fault, at least with those to whom it was of no consequence whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) was good or bad; but those who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) shrewdness and intelligence did not attribute her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) misdemeanour to ignorance but to wantonness and the natural disposition of women, which is for the most part flighty and ill-regulated.
<p/>Leandra withdrawn from sight, Anselmo's eyes grew blind, or at any rate found nothing to look at that gave them any pleasure, and mine were in darkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyable while Leandra was away.
<p/>Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grew less; we cursed the soldier's finery and railed at the carelessness of Leandra's father.
<p/>At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village and come to this valley; and, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) feeding a great flock of sheep of his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) own, and I a large herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees, giving vent to our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra's praises, or upbraiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>), or else sighing alone, and to heaven pouring forth our complaints in solitude.
<p/>Following our example, many more of Leandra's lovers have come to these rude mountains and adopted our mode of life, and they are so numerous that one would fancy the place had been turned into the pastoral Arcadia, so full is it of shepherds and sheep-folds; nor is there a spot in it where the name of the fair Leandra is not heard.
<p/>The peasant folk, who are naturally malicious, and when they have nothing to do Here one curses her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) and calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) capricious, fickle, and immodest, there another condemns her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) as frail and frivolous;
<p/>this pardons and absolves her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>), that spurns and reviles her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>); one extols her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) beauty, another assails her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) character, and in short all abuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>), and all adore her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>), and to such a pitch has this general infatuation gone that there are some who complain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) scorn without ever having exchanged a word with her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>), and even some that bewail and mourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) never gave anyone cause, for, as I have already said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) misconduct was known before her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) passion.
<p/>There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside, no shade beneath the trees that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) woes to the breezes; wherever there is an echo it repeats the name of Leandra; the mountains ring with <div class="bookquote">``Leandra,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leandra</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Leandra''  (<font color='red'><b>Leandra</b></font>)</div>murmur the brooks, and Leandra keeps us all bewildered and bewitched, hoping without hope and fearing without knowing what we fear.
<p/>Of all this silly set the one that shows the least and also the most sense is my rival Anselmo, for having so many other things to complain of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) only complains of separation, and to the accompaniment of a rebeck, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) plays admirably, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) sings his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) complaints in verses that show his (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) ingenuity.
<p/>I follow another, easier, and to my mind wiser course, and that is to rail at the frivolity of women, at their inconstancy, their double dealing, their broken promises, their unkept pledges, and in short the want of reflection they show in fixing their affections and inclinations.
<p/>This, sirs, was the reason of words and expressions I made use of to this goat when I came up just now; for as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) is a female I have a contempt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anselmo</b></font>) is the best in all my fold.
<p/>This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I have been tedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is close by, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as a variety of toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate.
<p/>CHAPTER LII. OF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER WITH THE RARE ADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEAT
<p/>The goatherd's tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the canon especially enjoyed it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) had remarked with particular attention the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the manner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit; and he (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) observed that the curate had been quite right in saying that the woods bred men of learning.
<p/>They all offered their services to Eugenio but he (<font color='blue'><b>Eugenio</b></font>) who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself in a position to attempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on your behalf, and would rescue Leandra from that convent -LRB-where no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) is kept against her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) will-RRB-, in spite of the abbess and all who might try to prevent me, and would place her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) in your hands to deal with her (<font color='blue'><b>Leandra</b></font>) according to your will and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no violence of any kind is to be offered to any damsel.
<p/>But I trust in God our Lord that the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but that the power of another better disposed may prove superior to it, and then I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by my profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and needy.
<p/>The goatherd eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and noticing Don Quixote's sorry appearance and looks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Senor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a strain?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who should it be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``but the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector of damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div><p/>That,'' said the goatherd, <div class="bookquote">``sounds like what one reads in the books of the knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it is my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has empty lodgings in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the goatherd</b></font>)</div><p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) BROUGHT TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION '' '' <div class="bookquote">``You are a great scoundrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and it is you who are empty and a fool.
<p/>I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and passing from words to deeds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) caught up a loaf that was near him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and sent it full in the goatherd's face, with such force that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) flattened his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, and found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote, and seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) by the throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), had not Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) by the shoulders flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) down on the table, smashing plates, breaking glasses, and upsetting and scattering everything on it.
<p/>Don Quixote, finding himself free, strove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face covered with blood, and soundly kicked by Sancho, was on all fours feeling about for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with.
<p/>The canon and the curate, however, prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), but the barber so contrived it that he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) got Don Quixote under him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and rained down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) such a shower of fisticuffs that the poor knight's face streamed with blood as freely as his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own.
<p/>The canon and the curate were bursting with laughter, the officers were capering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight.
<p/>Sancho alone was frantic, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not free himself from the grasp of one of the canon's servants, who kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) from going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's assistance.
<p/>At last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers who were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a trumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction whence the sound seemed to come.
<p/>But the one that was most excited by hearing it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was under the goatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``Brother devil -LRB-for it is impossible but
<p/>that thou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine-RRB-, I ask thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new adventure.
<p/>The goatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and being pummelled, released him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) at once, and Don Quixote rising to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents.
<p/>The fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from the earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organising processions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village that was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was on one side of that valley.
<p/>Don Quixote when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw the strange garb of the penitents, without reflecting how often he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had seen it before, took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was all the more confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and discourteous thieves were carrying off by force.
<p/>As soon as this occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at large, and taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bridled in an instant, and calling to Sancho for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sword
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mounted Rocinante, braced his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) buckler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who stood by, <div class="bookquote">``Now, noble company, ye shall see how important it is that there should be knights in the world professing the order of knight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there, whether knights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) legs to bear on Rocinante--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had no spurs--and at a full canter -LRB-for in all this veracious history we never read of Rocinante fairly galloping-RRB- set off to encounter the penitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>).
<p/>But it was out of their power, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) even stop for the shouts of Sancho calling after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), ``Where are you going, Senor Don Quixote?
<p/>mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady they are carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate Virgin.
<p/>Take care what you are doing, senor, for this time it may be safely said you don't know what you are about.
<p/>Sancho laboured in vain, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures and releasing the lady in black that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not hear a word; and even had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would not have turned back if the king had ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was already anxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) exclaimed, ``You who hide your faces, perhaps because you are not good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say to you.
<p/>The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and one of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by the strange figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the other ludicrous peculiarities he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) observed, said in reply to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``Brother, if you have anything to say to us say it quickly, for these brethren are whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it reasonable we should stop to hear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will say it in one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and it is this; that at once, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) off against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will, and that ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and I, who was born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not permit you to advance another step until you have restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the liberty she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pines for and deserves.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>What devils have possessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plague take me! '' '' '' ''
<p/>From these words all the hearers concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be a madman, and began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on Don Quixote's fury, for drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword without another word he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made a rush at the stand.
<p/>One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) comrades, advanced to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), flourishing a forked stick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) caught a mighty cut Don Quixote made at him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that severed it in two; but with the portion that remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of Don Quixote's sword arm -LRB-which the buckler could not protect against the clownish assault-RRB- that poor Don Quixote came to the ground in a sad plight.
<p/>Sancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) fall, cried out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) assailant not to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) again, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was a poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho's shouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hastily hitched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) tunic under his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) girdle and took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heels across the country like a deer.
<p/>By this time all Don Quixote's companions had come up to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lay; but the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the officers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief, and clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their scourges, as the priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack, resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against their assailants if they could.
<p/>Fortune, however, arranged the matter better than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's body, raising over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the most doleful and laughable lamentation that ever was heard, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was dead.
<p/>The curate was known to another curate who walked in the procession, and their recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both parties; the first then told the other in two words who Don Quixote was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) eyes, ``Oh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy well-spent life!
<p/>Oh pride of thy race, honour and glory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee will be full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds!
<p/>Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for only eight months of service thou hast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds!
<p/>Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble, encounterer of dangers, endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason, imitator of the good, scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, which is all that can be said!
<p/>At the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the first word he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said was, ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who lives separated from you, sweetest Dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these.
<p/>Aid me, friend Sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to press the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will do with all my heart, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and let us return to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more profitable and creditable to us.
<p/>Thou art right, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``It will be wise to let the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.
<p/>The canon, the curate, and the barber told him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) would act very wisely in doing as he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza's simplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before.
<p/>The procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road; the goatherd took his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) leave of the party; the officers of the Brotherhood declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to them; the canon begged the curate to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) know how Don Quixote did, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was cured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) madness or still suffered from it, and then begged leave to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) journey; in short, they all separated and went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded everything with as great resignation as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master.
<p/>The carter yoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) usual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six days they reached Don Quixote's village, and entered it about the middle of the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the people were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote's cart passed.
<p/>They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised their townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) housekeeper and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) niece that their master and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart.
<p/>It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw Don Quixote coming in at the gate.
<p/>At the news of Don Quixote's arrival Sancho Panza's wife came running, for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by this time knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband had gone away with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was if the ass was well.
<p/>Thanks be to God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for being so good to me; but now tell me, my friend, what have you made by your squirings?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' Sancho replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was, better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was. '' What gown have you brought me back?
<p/>What shoes for your children?'' <div class="bookquote">``I bring nothing of that sort, wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``though I bring other things of more consequence and value.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wife; ``show me these things of more value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will show them to you at home, wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``be content for the present; for if it please God that we should again go on our travels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is to be had.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Heaven grant it, husband,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for indeed we have need of it. But tell me, what's this about islands, for I don't understand it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``all in good time thou shalt see, wife--nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself called `your ladyship' by all thy vassals.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Teresa Panza--for so Sancho's wife was called, though they were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to take their husbands' surnames.
<p/>Don't be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``it is enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth.
<p/>But I may tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world more delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a knight-errant, and a seeker of adventures.
<p/>To be sure most of those one finds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred, ninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and vassals? '' I know it by experience, for out of some
<p/>Still, for all that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may happen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting castles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the maravedi to pay.
<p/>While this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) wife, Don Quixote's housekeeper and niece took him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) in and undressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) old bed.
<p/>I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) eyed them askance, and could not make out where he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was.
<p/>The curate charged his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) niece to be very careful to make her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lest he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should make his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) escape from them again, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) what they had been obliged to do to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) home.
<p/>On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored heaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the bottomless pit.
<p/>They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread lest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) found himself somewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out.
<p/>But the author of this history, though he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) has devoted research and industry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) third sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them, at any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely preserved in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the third time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sallied forth from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) home, betook himself to Saragossa, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had adventures there worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) valour and high intelligence.
<p/>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) end and death he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could learn no particulars, nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old physician for him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) who had in his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) possession a leaden box, which, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) account, had been discovered among the crumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box were found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in Castilian verse, containing many of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) achievements, and setting forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho Panza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) life and character; but all that could be read and deciphered were those which the trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here presents.
<p/>And the said author asks of those that shall read it nothing in return for the vast toil which it has cost him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) in examining and searching the Manchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that they give him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) the same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry that pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) will consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged to seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least equal in invention and not less entertaining.
<p/>The first words written on the parchment found in the leaden box were these: THE ACADEMICIANS OF ARGAMASILLA, A VILLAGE OF LA MANCHA,
<p/>THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE EPITAPH The scatterbrain that gave La Mancha more Rich spoils than Jason's; who a point so keen Had to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) wit, and
<p/>happier far had been If his (<font color='blue'><b>Jason</b></font>) wit's weathercock a blunter bore; The arm renowned far as Gaeta's shore, Cathay, and all the lands that lie between; The muse discreet and terrible in mien
<p/>As ever wrote on brass in days of yore; He (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) who surpassed the Amadises all, And who as naught the Galaors accounted, Supported by his (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) love and gallantry: Who made the Belianises sing small, And sought renown on Rocinante mounted; Here, underneath this cold stone, doth he (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) lie.

<p/>Nor youth nor beauty saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) from the claim Of death; he (<font color='blue'><b>Montiel</b></font>) paid love's bitter penalty, And left the marble to preserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Montiel</b></font>) name.

<p/>Nor ends his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) glory here, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) good steed Doth Brillador and Bayard far exceed; As mettled steeds compared with Rocinante, The reputation they have won is scanty.

<p/>AND OF THE WILL HE (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) MADE, AND HOW HE (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) DIED DON QUIXOTE PART II. DEDICATION OF PART II. TO THE COUNT OF LEMOS:
<p/>These days past, when sending Your Excellency my plays, that had appeared in print before being shown on the stage, I said,
<p/>if I remember well, that Don Quixote was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spurs to go and render homage to Your Excellency. Now I say that <div class="bookquote">``with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spurs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) way.
<p/>Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) reach destination methinks I shall have rendered some service to Your Excellency, as from many parts I am urged to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) off, so as to dispel the loathing and disgust caused by another Don Quixote who, under the name of Second Part, has run masquerading through the whole world.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who has shown the greatest longing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has been the great Emperor of China, who wrote me a letter in Chinese a month ago and sent it by a special courier.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) asked me, or to be truthful, he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) begged me to send him (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) Don Quixote, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) intended to found a college where the Spanish tongue would be taught, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wish that the book to be read should be the History of Don Quixote.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) also added that I should go and be the rector of this college. I asked the bearer if His (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) Majesty had afforded a sum in aid of my travel expenses.
<p/>Then, brother,'' I replied, ``you can return to your China, post haste or at whatever haste you are bound to go, as I am not fit for so long a travel and, besides being ill, I am very much without money, while Emperor for Emperor and Monarch for Monarch, I have at Naples the great Count of Lemos, who, without so many petty titles of colleges and rectorships, sustains me, protects me and does me more favour than I can wish for.
<p/>and I beg mine from you, offering Your Excellency the <div class="bookquote">``Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>a book I shall finish within four months, Deo volente, and which will be either the worst or the best that has been composed in our language,
<p/>I mean of those intended for entertainment; at which I repent of having called it the worst, for, in the opinion of friends, it is bound to attain the summit of possible quality.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``No, not even in thought.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' '' Thus I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) leave May Your Excellency return in such health that is wished you; Persiles will be ready to kiss your hand
<p/>and I your feet, being as I am, Your Excellency's most humble servant. From Madrid, this last day of October of the year one thousand six hundred and fifteen.
<p/>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE God bless me, gentle -LRB-or it may be plebeian-RRB- reader, how eagerly must thou be looking forward to this preface, expecting to find there retaliation, scolding, and abuse against the author of the second Don Quixote--
<p/>At the service of Your Excellency: MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRA VOLUME II. I mean him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) who was, they say, begotten at Tordesillas and born at Tarragona!
<p/>Well then, the truth is, I am not going to give thee that satisfaction; for, though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in mine the rule must admit of an exception.
<p/>Thou wouldst have me call him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) ass, fool, and malapert, but I have no such intention; let his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) offence be his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) punishment, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) bread let him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) eat it, and there's an end of it.
<p/>What I cannot help taking amiss is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) charges me with being old and one-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from passing over me, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in some tavern, and not on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or the future can hope to see.
<p/>If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder's eye, they are, at least, honourable in the estimation of those who know where they were received; for the soldier shows to greater advantage dead in battle than alive in flight; and so strongly is this my feeling, that if now it were proposed to perform an impossibility for me, I would rather have had my share in that mighty action, than be free from my wounds this minute without having been present at it.
<p/>Those the soldier shows on his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) face and breast are stars that direct others to the heaven of honour and ambition of merited praise; and moreover it is to be observed that it is not with grey hairs that one writes, but with the understanding, and that commonly improves with years.
<p/>I take it amiss, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) calls me envious, and explains to me, as if I were ignorant, what envy is; for really and truly, of the two kinds there are, I only know that which is holy, noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it is, I am not likely to attack a priest, above all if, in addition, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) holds the rank of familiar of the Holy Office.
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) said what he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) did on account of him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) on whose behalf it seems he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is entirely mistaken; for I worship the genius of that person, and admire his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) works and his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) unceasing and strenuous industry.
<p/>After all, I am grateful to this gentleman, the author, for saying that my novels are more satirical than exemplary, but that they are good; for they could not be that unless there was a little of everything in them.
<p/>I suspect thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and keeping myself too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a feeling that additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer, and that what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) does not dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight, but hides his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name and disguises his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) country as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been guilty of some lese majesty.
<p/>If perchance thou shouldst come to know him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), tell him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) from me that I do not hold myself aggrieved; for I know well what the temptations of the devil are, and that one of the greatest is putting it into a man's head that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can write and print a book by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will get as much fame as money, and as much money as fame; and to prove it I will beg of you, in your own sprightly, pleasant way, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) this story.
<p/>There was a madman in Seville who took to one of the drollest absurdities and vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to.
<p/>It was this: he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) made a tube of reed sharp at one end, and catching a dog in the street, or wherever it might be, he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) foot held one of its legs fast, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) hand lifted up the other, and as best he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) could fixed the tube where, by blowing, he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) made the dog as round as a ball; then holding it in this position, he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) gave it a couple of slaps on the belly, and let it go, saying to the bystanders -LRB-and there were always plenty of them-RRB-: <div class="bookquote">``Do your worships think, now, that it is an easy thing to blow up a dog?'' (<font color='red'><b>the bystanders</b></font>)</div>--Does your worship think now, that it is an easy thing to write a book?
<p/>And if this story does not suit him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>), you may, dear reader, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) this one, which is likewise of a madman and a dog.
<p/>In Cordova there was another madman, whose way it was to carry a piece of marble slab or a stone, not of the lightest, on his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) head, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) came upon any unwary dog he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) used to draw close to him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) and let the weight fall right on top of him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>); on which the dog in a rage, barking and howling, would run three streets without stopping.
<p/>It so happened, however, that one of the dogs he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) discharged his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) load upon was a cap-maker's dog, of which his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) master was very fond.
<p/>The stone came down hitting it on the head, the dog raised a yell at the blow, the master saw the affair and was wroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushed out at the madman and did not leave a sound bone in his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) body, and at every stroke he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You dog, you thief!
<p/>my lurcher! Don't you see, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and so, repeating the word <div class="bookquote">``lurcher''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>again and again, he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) sent the madman away beaten to a jelly.
<p/>The madman took the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for more than a month never once showed himself in public; but after that he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) came out again with his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) old trick and a heavier load than ever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) came up to where there was a dog, and examining it very carefully without venturing to let the stone fall, he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``This is a lurcher; ware!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In short, all the dogs he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) said were lurchers; and he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) discharged no more stones.
<p/>Maybe it will be the same with this historian; that he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) will not venture another time to discharge the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) wit in books, which, being bad, are harder than stones.
<p/>Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>), too, that I do not care a farthing for the threat he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) holds out to me of depriving me of my profit by means of his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) book; for, to borrow from the famous interlude of <div class="bookquote">``The Perendenga,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I say in answer to him (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>), ``Long life to my lord the Veintiquatro, and Christ be with us all.
<p/>Long life to the great Conde de Lemos, whose Christian charity and well-known generosity support me against all the strokes of my curst fortune; and long life to the supreme benevolence of His (<font color='blue'><b>Lemos</b></font>) Eminence of Toledo, Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas; and what matter if there be no printing-presses in the world, or if they print more books against me than there are letters in the verses of Mingo Revulgo!
<p/>These two princes, unsought by any adulation or flattery of mine, of their own goodness alone, have taken it upon them to show me kindness and protect me, and in this I consider myself happier and richer than if Fortune had raised me to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) greatest height in the ordinary way.
<p/>The poor man may retain honour, but not the vicious; poverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannot hide it altogether; and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, even though it be through the straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteem of lofty and noble spirits, and in consequence their protection.
<p/>Thou needst say no more to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), nor will I say anything more to thee, save to tell thee to bear in mind that this Second Part of <div class="bookquote">``Don Quixote''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which I offer thee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth as the First, and that in it I present thee Don Quixote continued, and at length dead and buried, so that no one may dare to bring forward any further evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), for that already produced is sufficient; and suffice it, too, that some reputable person should have given an account of all these shrewd lunacies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) without going into the matter again; for abundance, even of good things, prevents them from being valued; and scarcity, even in the case of what is bad, confers a certain value.
<p/>I was forgetting to tell thee that thou mayest expect the <div class="bookquote">``Persiles,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which I am now finishing, and also the Second Part of ``Galatea.
<p/>AND THE BARBER HAD WITH DON QUIXOTE ABOUT HIS (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>) MALADY Cide Hamete Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and third sally of Don Quixote, says that the curate and the barber remained nearly a month without seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), lest they should recall or bring back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) recollection what had taken place.
<p/>They did not, however, omit to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be careful to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with attention, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) comforting things to eat, and such as were good for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to see, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) misfortune proceeded.
<p/>The niece and housekeeper replied that they did so, and meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity, for they could perceive that their master was now and then beginning to show signs of being in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) right mind.
<p/>This gave great satisfaction to the curate and the barber, for they concluded they had taken the right course in carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) off enchanted on the ox-cart, as has been described in the First Part of this great as well as accurate history, in the last chapter thereof.
<p/>So they resolved to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) a visit and test the improvement in his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) condition, although they thought it almost impossible that there could be any; and they agreed not to touch upon any point connected with knight-errantry so as not to run the risk of reopening wounds which were still so tender.
<p/>They came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) consequently, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) sitting up in bed in a green baize waistcoat and a red Toledo cap, and so withered and dried up that he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) had been turned into a mummy.
<p/>They were very cordially received by him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>); they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) health, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) talked to them about himself very naturally and in very well-chosen language.
<p/>In the course of their conversation they fell to discussing what they call State-craft and systems of government, correcting this abuse and condemning that, reforming one practice and abolishing another, each of the three setting up for a new legislator, a modern Lycurgus, or a brand-new Solon; and so completely did they remodel the State, that they seemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out something quite different from what they had put in; and on all the subjects they dealt with, Don Quixote spoke with such good sense that the pair of examiners were fully convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was quite recovered and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) full senses.
<p/>The niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could not find words enough to express their thanks to God at seeing their master so clear in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind; the curate, however, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) original plan, which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved to test Don Quixote's recovery thoroughly, and see whether it were genuine or not; and so, from one subject to another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) came at last to talk of the news that had come from the capital, and, among other things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said it was considered certain that the Turk was coming down with a powerful fleet, and that no one knew what his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) purpose was, or when the great storm would burst; and that all Christendom was in apprehension of this, which almost every year calls us to arms, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) Majesty had made provision for the security of the coasts of Naples and Sicily and the island of Malta.
<p/>To this Don Quixote replied, ``His (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) Majesty has acted like a prudent warrior in providing for the safety of his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) realms in time, so that the enemy may not find him (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) unprepared; but if my advice were taken I would recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) Majesty is very far from thinking of.
<p/>The moment the curate heard this he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``God keep thee in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand, poor Don Quixote, for it seems to me thou art precipitating thyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thy simplicity.
<p/>But the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked Don Quixote what would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) advice as to the measures that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said ought to be adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to be added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were in the habit of offering to princes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER I. OF THE INTERVIEW THE CURATE '' '' '' Mine, master shaver,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``will not be impertinent, but, on the contrary, pertinent.
<p/>I don't mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``but that experience has shown that all or most of the expedients which are proposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) Majesty are either impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the King and to the kingdom.

 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And who will be security for you, senor curate?'' said Don Quixote. '' My profession,'' replied the curate, <div class="bookquote">``which is to keep secrets.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ods body!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote at this, <div class="bookquote">``what more has his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) Majesty to do but to command, by public proclamation, all the knights-errant that are scattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital, for even if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them who alone will suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk.
<p/>Is it, pray, any new thing for a single knight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as if they all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste?
<p/>If only -LRB-in an evil hour for me: I don't speak for anyone else-RRB- the famous Don Belianis were alive now, or any one of the innumerable progeny of Amadis of Gaul!
<p/>If any these were alive to-day, and were to come face to face with the Turk, by my faith, I would not give much for the Turk's chance.
<p/>But God will have regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) people, and will provide some one, who, if not so valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at least will not be inferior to them in spirit; but God knows what I mean, and I say no more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas!''  (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the niece at this, <div class="bookquote">``may I die if my master does not want to turn knight-errant again;''  (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div>to which Don Quixote replied, ``A knight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk come down or go up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) likes, and in as strong force as he (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) can, once more I say, God knows what I mean.
<p/>But here the barber said, <div class="bookquote">``I ask your worships to give me leave to tell a short story of something that happened in Seville, which comes so pat to the purpose just now that I should like greatly to tell it.

<p/>Don Quixote gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) leave, and the rest prepared to listen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began thus: <div class="bookquote">``In the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relations had placed there as being out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a graduate of Osuna in canon law; but even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion of most people that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been mad all the same.
<p/>This graduate, after some years of confinement, took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>graduate</b></font>) head that he (<font color='blue'><b>graduate</b></font>) was sane and in his (<font color='blue'><b>graduate</b></font>) full senses, and under this impression wrote to the Archbishop, entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) earnestly, and in very correct language, to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) released from the misery in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) was living; for by God's mercy he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had now recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lost reason, though his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) relations, in order to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) property, kept him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) there, and, in spite of the truth, would make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) out to be mad until his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dying day.
<p/>The Archbishop, moved by repeated sensible, well-written letters, directed one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) chaplains to make inquiry of the madhouse as to the truth of the licentiate's statements, and to have an interview with the madman himself, and, if it should appear that he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) senses, to take him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) out and restore him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) to liberty.
<p/>The chaplain did so, and the governor assured him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) that the man was still mad, and that though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often spoke like a highly intelligent person, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would in the end break out into nonsense that in quantity and quality counterbalanced all the sensible things he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said before, as might be easily tested by talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The chaplain resolved to try the experiment, and obtaining access to the madman conversed with him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) for an hour or more, during the whole of which time he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) never uttered a word that was incoherent or absurd, but, on the contrary, spoke so rationally that the chaplain was compelled to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) to be sane.
<p/>Among other things, he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) said the governor was against him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>), not to lose the presents his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) relations made him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) for reporting him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) still mad but with lucid intervals; and that the worst foe he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) misfortune was his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) large property; for in order to enjoy it his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) enemies disparaged and threw doubts upon the mercy our Lord had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) from a brute beast into a man.
<p/>In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke in such a way that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cast suspicion on the governor, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relations appear covetous and heartless, and himself so rational that the chaplain determined to take him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) away with him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) that the Archbishop might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>), and ascertain for himself the truth of the matter.
<p/>Yielding to this conviction, the worthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes in which the licentiate had entered the house given to him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>).
<p/>The governor again bade him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) beware of what he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) was doing, as the licentiate was beyond a doubt still mad; but all his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain from taking him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) away.
<p/>The governor, seeing that it was the order of the Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the licentiate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) own clothes, which were new and decent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>), as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) saw himself clothed like one in his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) senses, and divested of the appearance of a madman, entreated the chaplain to permit him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) in charity to go and take leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) comrades the madmen.
<p/>The chaplain said he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) to see what madmen there were in the house; so they went upstairs, and with them some of those who were present.
<p/>Approaching a cage in which there was a furious madman, though just at that moment calm and quiet, the licentiate said to him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>), `Brother, think if you have any commands for me, for I am going home, as God has been pleased, in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) infinite goodness and mercy, without any merit of mine, to restore me my reason.
<p/>Have strong hope and trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), for as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has restored me to my original condition, so likewise he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will restore you if you trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>I will take care to send you some good things to eat; and be sure you eat them; for I would have
<p/>you know I am convinced, as one who has gone through it, that all this madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains full of wind.
<p/>I am now cured and in my senses, for with God's power nothing is impossible. Take courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune breaks down health and brings on death.'
<p/>To all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite that of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up from an old mat on which he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) lay stark naked, he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) asked in a loud voice who it was that was going away cured and in his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) senses.
<p/>The licentiate answered, `It is I, brother, who am going; I have now no need to remain here any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has had so great mercy upon me.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''`Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don't let the devil deceive you,' replied the madman. ' Keep quiet, stay where you are, and you will save yourself the trouble of coming back.'
<p/>'I know I am cured,' returned the licentiate, `and that I shall not have to go stations again.' ''`You cured!' said the madman; `well, we shall see; God be with you; but I swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty I represent on earth, that for this crime alone, which Seville is committing to-day in releasing you from this house, and treating you as if you were in your senses, I shall have to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered for ages and ages, amen.
<p/>Dost thou not know, thou miserable little licentiate, that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the Thunderer, who hold in my hands the fiery bolts with which I am able and am wont to threaten and lay waste the world?
<p/>But in one way only will I punish this ignorant town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any part of its district or territory, for three whole years, to be reckoned from the day and moment when this threat is pronounced.
<p/>'' Thou free, thou cured, thou in thy senses! and I mad , I disordered, I bound! I will as soon think of sending rain as of hanging myself.
<p/>Those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the madman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) by the hands, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>), `Be not uneasy, senor; attach no importance to what this madman has said; for if he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) is Jupiter and will not send rain, I, who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as often as it pleases me and may be needful.'
<p/>The governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the chaplain was half ashamed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) replied, `For all that, Senor Neptune, it will not do to vex Senor Jupiter; remain where you are, and some other day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we will come back for you.'
<p/>'' '' So they stripped the licentiate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) was left where he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) was; and that's the end of the story.
<p/>So that's the story, master barber,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``which came in so pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it?
<p/>Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always odious and unwelcome?
<p/>I, master barber, am not Neptune, the god of the waters, nor do I try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for I am not one.
<p/>My only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it makes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order of knight-errantry was in the field.
<p/>But our depraved age does not deserve to enjoy such a blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant took upon their shoulders the defence of kingdoms, the protection of damsels, the succour of orphans and minors, the chastisement of the proud, and the recompense of the humble.
<p/>With the knights of these days, for the most part, it is the damask, brocade, and rich stuffs they wear, that rustle as they go, not the chain mail of their armour; no knight now-a-days sleeps in the open field exposed to the inclemency of heaven, and in full panoply from head to foot; no one now takes a nap, as they call it, without drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) feet out of the stirrups, and leaning upon his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lance, as the knights-errant used to do; no one now, issuing from the wood, penetrates yonder mountains, and then treads the barren, lonely shore of the sea--mostly a tempestuous and stormy one--and finding on the beach a little bark without oars, sail, mast, or tackling of any kind, in the intrepidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) heart flings himself into it and commits himself to the wrathful billows of the deep sea, that one moment lift him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) up to heaven and
<p/>the next plunge him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) into the depths; and opposing his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) breast to the irresistible gale, finds himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) least expects it, three thousand leagues and more away from the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) embarked; and leaping ashore in a remote and unknown land has adventures that deserve to be written, not on parchment, but on brass.
<p/>But now sloth triumphs over energy, indolence over exertion, vice over virtue, arrogance over courage, and theory over practice in arms, which flourished and shone only in the golden ages and in knights-errant.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' Master shaver, master shaver! how blind is he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) who cannot see through a sieve. For tell me, who was more virtuous and more valiant than the famous Amadis of Gaul?
<p/>Who more discreet than Palmerin of England? Who more gracious and easy than Tirante el Blanco? Who more courtly than Lisuarte of Greece?
<p/>Who more slashed or slashing than Don Belianis? Who more intrepid than Perion of Gaul? Who more ready to face danger than Felixmarte of Hircania?
<p/>Who more sincere than Esplandian? Who more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of Thrace? Who more bold than Rodamonte? Who more prudent than King Sobrino?
<p/>and who more gallant and courteous than Ruggiero, from whom the dukes of Ferrara of the present day are descended, according to Turpin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) `Cosmography.'
<p/>Who more daring than Reinaldos? Who more invincible than Roland? All these knights, and many more that I could name, senor curate, were knights-errant, the light and glory of chivalry.
<p/>These, or such as these, I would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) Majesty would find himself well served and would save great expense, and the Turk would be left tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Turk</b></font>) beard.
<p/>And so I will stay where I am, as the chaplain does not take me away; and if Jupiter, as the barber has told us, will not send rain, here am I, and I will rain when I please.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Senor Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber, <div class="bookquote">``I did not mean it in that way, and, so help me God, my intention was good, and your worship ought not to be vexed.
<p/>I say this that Master Basin may know that I understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>'' '' As to whether I ought to be vexed or not,'' returned Don Quixote, ``I myself am the best judge.
<p/>Hereupon the curate observed, <div class="bookquote">``I have hardly said a word as yet; and I would gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what Don Quixote has said, that worries and works my conscience.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>The senor curate has leave for more than that,'' returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) may declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) doubt, for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on one's conscience.
<p/>Well then, with that permission,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``I say my doubt is that, all I can do, I cannot persuade myself that the whole pack of knights-errant you, Senor Don Quixote, have mentioned, were really and truly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world; on the contrary, I suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, and dreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>That is another mistake,'' replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``into which many have fallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in the world, and I have often, with divers people and on divers occasions, tried to expose this almost universal error to the light of truth.
<p/>Sometimes I have not been successful in my purpose, sometimes I have, supporting it upon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is so clear that I can almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul, who was a man of lofty stature,
<p/>fair complexion, with a handsome though black beard, of a countenance between gentle and stern in expression, sparing of words, slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>); and as I have depicted Amadis,
<p/>, I think, portray and describe all the knights-errant that are in all the histories in the world; for by the perception I have that they were what their histories describe, and by the deeds they did and the dispositions they displayed, it is possible, with the aid of sound philosophy, to deduce their features, complexion, and stature.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' '' so I could <div class="bookquote">``How big, in your worship's opinion, may the giant Morgante have been, Senor Don Quixote?
<p/>With regard to giants,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``opinions differ as to whether there ever were any or not in the world; but the Holy Scripture, which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that there were, when it gives us the history of that big Philistine, Goliath, who was seven cubits and a half in height, which is a huge size.
<p/>Likewise, in the island of Sicily, there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so large that their size makes it plain that their owners were giants, and as tall as great towers; geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt.
<p/>But, for all that, I cannot speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante, though I suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cannot have been very tall; and I am inclined to be of this opinion because I find in the history in which his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) deeds are particularly mentioned, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) frequently slept under a roof and as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) found houses to contain him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), it is clear that his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bulk could not have been anything excessive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment of hearing such nonsense, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) what was his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) notion of the features of Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve Peers of France, for they were all knights-errant.
<p/>As for Reinaldos,'' replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I venture to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was broad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish and somewhat prominent eyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to the society of thieves and scapegraces.
<p/>With regard to Roland, or Rotolando, or Orlando -LRB-for the histories call him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) by all these names-RRB-, I am of opinion, and hold, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) was of middle height, broad-shouldered, rather bow-legged, swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy body and a severe expression of countenance, a man of few words, but very polite and well-bred.
<p/>If Roland was not a more graceful person than your worship has described,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``it is no wonder that the fair Lady Angelica rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) for the gaiety, liveliness, and grace of that budding-bearded little Moor to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelica</b></font>) surrendered herself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelica</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelica</b></font>) sense in falling in love with the gentle softness of Medoro rather than the roughness of Roland.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That Angelica, senor curate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``was a giddy damsel, flighty and somewhat wanton, and she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) left the world as full of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) vagaries as of the fame of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) beauty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) treated with scorn a thousand gentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with a smooth-faced sprig of a page, without fortune or fame, except such reputation for gratitude as the affection he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) friend got for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>The great poet who sang her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) beauty, the famous Ariosto, not caring to sing her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) adventures after her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) contemptible surrender -LRB-which probably were not over and above creditable-RRB-, dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) says: How she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) received the sceptre of Cathay, Some bard of defter quill may sing some day; and this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called vates, that is to say diviners; and its truth was made plain; for since then a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) tears, and another famous and rare poet, a Castilian, has sung her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) beauty.''

<p/>The curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of the three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt out a whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that might not be altogether to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) credit, called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and made the other two hold their tongues and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) come in.
<p/>Sancho entered, and the curate and the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose recovery they despaired when they saw how wedded he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) crazy ideas, and how saturated with the nonsense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) unlucky chivalry; and said the curate to the barber, <div class="bookquote">``You will see, gossip, that when we are least thinking of it, our gentleman will be off once more for another flight.

<p/>In short, Sancho, I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on this subject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to the good or taking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyal vassals to tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its proper shape, not allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it.
<p/>And I would have thee know, Sancho, that if the naked truth, undisguised by flattery, came to the ears of princes, times would be different, and other ages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours, which I hold to be the golden of these latter days.
<p/>Profit by this advice, Sancho, and report to me clearly and faithfully the truth of what thou knowest touching what I have demanded of thee.''

<p/>The hidalgos say that, not keeping within the bounds of your quality of gentleman, you have assumed the `Don,' and made a knight of yourself at a jump, with four vine-stocks and a couple of acres of land, and never a shirt to your back.

<p/>Some say, `mad but droll;' others, `valiant but unlucky;' others, `courteous but meddling,' and then they go into such a number of things that they don't leave a whole bone either in your worship or in myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' As to your worship's valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and task, there is a variety of opinions. <div class="bookquote">``Recollect, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that wherever virtue exists in an eminent degree it is persecuted.
<p/>Julius Caesar, the boldest, wisest, and bravest of captains, was charged with being ambitious, and not particularly cleanly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) dress, or pure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) morals.
<p/>Few or none of the famous men that have lived escaped being calumniated by malice. Of Alexander, whose deeds won him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexander</b></font>) the name of Great, they say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was somewhat of a drunkard.
<p/>Of Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, it was whispered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) was over-quarrelsome, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) brother that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) was lachrymose.
<p/>So that, O Sancho, amongst all these calumnies against good men, mine may be let pass, since they are no more than thou hast said.
<p/>Of Hercules, him (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) of the many labours, it is said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) was lewd and luxurious. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' That's just where it is, body of my father!''
<p/>There's the tail to be skinned yet,'' said Sancho; ``all so far is cakes and fancy bread; but if your worship wants to know all about the calumnies they bring against you, I will fetch you one this instant who can tell you the whole of them without missing an atom; for last night the son of Bartholomew Carrasco, who has been studying at Salamanca, came home after having been made a bachelor, and when I went to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) told me that your worship's history is already abroad in books, with the title of THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN
<p/>DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA; and he (<font color='blue'><b>MANCHA</b></font>) says they mention me in it by my own name of Sancho Panza, and the lady Dulcinea del Toboso too, and divers things that happened to us when we were alone; so that I crossed myself in my wonder how the historian who wrote them down could have known them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I promise thee, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``the author of our history will be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they choose to write about is hidden.
<p/>Why, the bachelor Samson Carrasco -LRB-that is the name of him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) I spoke of-RRB- says the author of the history is called Cide Hamete Berengena.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there more, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>asked Don Quixote. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``What!''

<p/>'' May be so,'' replied Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for I have heard say that the Moors are mostly great lovers of berengenas. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Very likely,'' replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but if your worship wishes me to fetch the bachelor I will go for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in a twinkling.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am off for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; and leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went in quest of the bachelor, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) returned in a short time, and,
<p/>'' Thou must have mistaken the surname of this `Cide'--which means in Arabic `Lord'--Sancho,'' observed Don Quixote. '' '' '' all three together, they had a very droll colloquy.
<p/>OF THE LAUGHABLE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE, SANCHO PANZA, AND THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO Don Quixote remained very deep in thought, waiting for the bachelor Carrasco, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) was to hear how he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) himself had been put into a book as Sancho said; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not persuade himself that any such history could be in existence, for the blood of the enemies he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had slain was not yet dry on the blade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sword, and now they wanted to make out that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mighty achievements were going about in print.
<p/>For all that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancied some sage, either a friend or an enemy, might, by the aid of magic, have given them to the press; if a friend, in order to magnify and exalt them above the most famous ever achieved by any knight-errant; if an enemy, to bring them to naught and degrade them below the meanest ever recorded of any low squire, though as he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) said to himself, the achievements of squires never were recorded.
<p/>If, however, it were the fact that such a history were in existence, it must necessarily, being the story of a knight-errant, be grandiloquent, lofty, imposing, grand and true.
<p/>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) comforted himself somewhat, though it made him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) uncomfortable to think that the author was a Moor, judging by the title of <div class="bookquote">``Cide;''  (<font color='red'><b>author a Moor</b></font>)</div>and that no truth was to be looked for from Moors, as they are all impostors, cheats, and schemers.
<p/>, that might tend to the discredit and prejudice of the purity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) lady Dulcinea del Toboso; he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) would have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) set forth the fidelity and respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) had always observed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>), spurning queens, empresses, and damsels of all sorts, and keeping in check the impetuosity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) natural impulses.
<p/>Absorbed and wrapped up in these and divers other cogitations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) was found by Sancho and Carrasco, whom Don Quixote received with great courtesy.
<p/>CHAPTER III. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might have dealt with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) love affairs in some indecorous fashion The bachelor, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was called Samson, was of no great bodily size, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was a very great wag
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was of a sallow complexion, but very sharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with a round face, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of a mischievous disposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) gave a sample as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw Don Quixote, by falling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knees before him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and saying, ``Let me kiss your mightiness's hand, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, for, by the habit of St. Peter that I wear, though I have no more than the first four orders, your worship is one of the most famous knights-errant that have ever been, or will be, all the world over.
<p/>A blessing on Cide Hamete Benengeli, who has written the history of your great deeds, and a double blessing on that connoisseur who took the trouble of having it translated out of the Arabic into our Castilian vulgar tongue for the universal entertainment of the people!
<p/>Don Quixote made him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rise, and said, <div class="bookquote">``So, then, it is true that there is a history of me, and that it was a Moor and a sage who wrote it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So true is it, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Samson, <div class="bookquote">``that my belief is there are more than twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print this very day.
<p/>Only ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they have been printed, and moreover there is a report that it is being printed at Antwerp, and I am persuaded there will not be a country or language in which there will not be a translation of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the things,'' here observed Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that ought to give most pleasure to a virtuous and eminent man is to find himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lifetime in print and in type, familiar in people's mouths with a good name; I say with a good name, for if it be the opposite, then there is no death to be compared to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>If it goes by good name and fame,'' said the bachelor, ``your worship alone bears away the palm from all the knights-errant; for the Moor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) own language, and the Christian in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), have taken care to set before us your gallantry, your high courage in encountering dangers, your fortitude in adversity, your patience under misfortunes as well as wounds, the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your worship and my lady Dona Dulcinea del

 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Certainly not,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but tell me, senor bachelor, what deeds of mine are they that are made most of in this history?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bachelor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, senor bachelor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho at this point, <div class="bookquote">``does the adventure with the Yanguesans come in, when our good Rocinante went hankering after dainties?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,'' replied Samson; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) tells all and sets down everything, even to the capers that worthy Sancho cut in the blanket.''

<p/>There is no human history in the world, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``that has not its ups and downs, but more than others such as deal with chivalry, for they can never be entirely made up of prosperous adventures.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bachelor</b></font>)</div>replied the bachelor, <div class="bookquote">``there are those who have read the history who say they would have been glad if the author had left out some of the countless cudgellings that were inflicted on Senor Don Quixote in various encounters.

<p/>At the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence,'' observed Don Quixote; ``for there is no need of recording events which do not change or affect the truth of a history, if they tend to bring the hero of it into contempt.
<p/>AEneas was not in truth and earnest so pious as Virgil represents him (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>), nor Ulysses so wise as Homer describes him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Samson; <div class="bookquote">``but it is one thing to write as a poet, another to write as a historian; the poet may describe or sing things, not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has to write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were, without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it.
<p/>Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``if this senor Moor goes in for telling the truth, no doubt among my master's drubbings mine are to be found; for they never took the measure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) worship's shoulders without doing the same for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that, for, as my master himself says, the members must share the pain of the head.''

<p/>May God shorten mine, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned the bachelor, <div class="bookquote">``if you are not the second person in the history, and there are even some who would rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though there are some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believing there was any possibility in the government of that island offered you by Senor Don Quixote.
<p/>There is still sunshine on the wall,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bachelor person</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``and when Sancho is somewhat more advanced in life, with the experience that years bring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) will be fitter and better qualified for being a governor than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is at present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Samson; ``and if it be God's will, there will not be any want of a thousand islands, much less one, for Sancho to govern.

 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Those are not governors of islands,'' observed Samson, ``but of other governments of an easier kind: those that govern islands must at least know grammar.

<p/>Then, I say,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``the author of my history was no sage, but some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard and heedless way, set about writing it,
<p/>let it turn out as it might, just as Orbaneja, the painter of Ubeda, used to do, who, when they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) was painting, answered, `What it may turn out.'
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would paint a cock in such a fashion, and so unlike, that he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had to write alongside of it in Gothic letters, `This is a cock; and so it will be with my history, which will require a commentary to make it intelligible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>No fear of that,'' returned Samson, <div class="bookquote">``for it is so plain that there is nothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves, the young people read it
<p/>; in a word, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of all sorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, `There goes Rocinante.'
<p/>And those that are most given to reading it are the pages, for there is not a lord's ante-chamber where there is not a `Don Quixote' to be found; one takes it up if another lays it down; this one pounces upon it, and that begs for it.
<p/>In short, the said history is the most delightful and least injurious entertainment that has been hitherto seen, for there is not to be found in the whole of it even the semblance of an immodest word, or a thought that is other than Catholic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><p/>To write in any other way,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``would not be to write truth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehood ought to be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know not what could have led the author to have recourse to novels and irrelevant stories, when he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) had so much to write about in mine; no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) must have gone by the proverb `with straw or with hay, etc,' for by merely setting forth my thoughts, my sighs, my tears, my lofty purposes, my enterprises, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) might have made a volume as large, or larger than all the works of El Tostado would make up.
<p/>In fact, the conclusion I arrive at, senor bachelor, is, that to write histories, or books of any kind, there is need of great judgment and a ripe understanding.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' , the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it '' To give expression to humour, and write in a strain of graceful pleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses.
<p/>The cleverest character in comedy is the clown, for he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) who would make people take him (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) for a fool, must not be one.
<p/>History is in a measure a sacred thing, for it should be true, and where the truth is, there God is; but notwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling books broadcast on the world as if they were fritters.
<p/>No doubt of that,'' replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but it often happens that those who have acquired and attained a well-deserved reputation by their writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some degree, when they give them to the press.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The reason of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Samson, <div class="bookquote">``is, that as printed works are examined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and the greater the fame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised.
<p/>Men famous for their genius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always, or most commonly, envied by those who take a particular delight and pleasure in criticising the writings of others, without having produced any of their own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><p/>That is no wonder,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``for there are many divines who are no good for the pulpit, but excellent in detecting the defects or excesses of those who preach.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' There is no book so bad but it has something good in it,'' said the bachelor. '' '' ''
<p/>All that is true, Senor Don Quixote,'' said Carrasco; <div class="bookquote">``but I wish such fault-finders were more lenient and less exacting, and did not pay so much attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble at; for if aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus, they should remember how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) remained awake to shed the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) work with as little shade as possible; and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with may be moles, that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears them; and so I say very great is the risk to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) who prints a book exposes himself, for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write one that will satisfy and please all readers.
<p/>Quite the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said the bachelor; <div class="bookquote">``for, as stultorum infinitum est numerus, innumerable are those who have relished the said history; but some have brought a charge against the author's memory, inasmuch as he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) forgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho's Dapple; for it is not stated there, but only to be inferred from what is set down, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was stolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho mounted on the same ass, without any reappearance of it.
<p/>They say, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) forgot to state what Sancho did with those hundred crowns that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found in the valise in the Sierra Morena, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) never alludes to them again, and there are many who would be glad to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did with them, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) spent them on, for it is one of the serious omissions of the work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bachelor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Senor Samson, I am not in a humour now for going into accounts or explanations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for there's a sinking of the stomach come over me, and unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuff it will put me on the thorn of Santa Lucia.
<p/>I have it at home, and my old woman is waiting for me; after dinner I'll come back, and will answer you and all the world
<p/>every question you may choose to ask, as well about the loss of the ass as about the spending of the hundred crowns;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and without another word or waiting for a reply he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucia</b></font>) made off home.
<p/>'' '' '' That which treats of me must have pleased few,'' said Don Quixote. '' Don Quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>The bachelor accepted the invitation and remained, a couple of young pigeons were added to the ordinary fare, at dinner they talked chivalry, Carrasco fell in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) host's humour, the banquet came to an end, they took their afternoon sleep, Sancho returned, and their conversation was resumed.
<p/>CHAPTER IV. IN WHICH SANCHO PANZA GIVES A SATISFACTORY REPLY TO THE DOUBTS AND QUESTIONS OF THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTH KNOWING AND
<p/>TELLING Sancho came back to Don Quixote's house, and returning to the late subject of conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``As to what Senor Samson said, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) would like to know by whom, or how, or when my ass was stolen, I say in reply that the same night we went into the Sierra Morena, flying from the Holy Brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galley slaves, and the other of the corpse that was going to Segovia, my master
<p/>and I ensconced ourselves in a thicket, and there, my master leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lance, and I seated on my Dapple, battered and weary with the late frays we fell asleep as if it had been on four feather mattresses; and I in particular slept so sound, that, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was able to come and prop me up on four stakes, which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) put under the four corners of the pack-saddle in such a way that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) left me mounted on it, and took away Dapple from under me without my feeling it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That is an easy matter,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and it is no new occurrence, for the same thing happened to Sacripante at the siege of Albracca; the famous thief, Brunello, by the same contrivance, took his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) horse from between his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) legs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Day came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>continued Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and the moment I stirred the stakes gave way and I fell to the ground with a mighty come down
<p/>; I looked about for the ass, but could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); the tears rushed to my eyes and I raised such a lamentation that, if the author of our history has not put it in, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) may depend upon it he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) has left out a good thing.
<p/>Some days after, I know not how many, travelling with her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) ladyship the Princess Micomicona, I saw my ass, and mounted upon him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>), in the dress of a gipsy, was that Gines de Pasamonte, the great rogue and rascal that my master and I freed from the chain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not where the mistake is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>replied Samson; <div class="bookquote">``it is, that before the ass has turned up, the author speaks of Sancho as being mounted on it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to say to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``unless that the historian made a mistake, or perhaps it might be a blunder of the printer's.
<p/>To which Sancho answered, <div class="bookquote">``I spent them for my own good, and my wife's, and my children's, and it is they that have made my wife bear so patiently all my wanderings on highways and byways, in the service of my master,
<p/>Don Quixote; for if after all this time I had come back to the house without a rap and without the ass, it would have been a poor look-out for me; and if anyone wants to know anything more about me, here I am, ready to answer the king himself in person; and it is no affair of anyone's whether I took or did not take, whether I spent or did not spend; for the whacks that were given me in these journeys were to be paid for in money, even if they were valued at no more than four maravedis apiece, another hundred crowns would not pay me for half of them.
<p/>Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and black white; for each of us is as God made him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), aye, and often worse.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' No doubt that's it,'' said Samson; <div class="bookquote">``but what became of the hundred crowns? Did they vanish? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Carrasco, <div class="bookquote">``to impress upon the author of the history that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) prints it again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) must not forget what worthy Sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything else to correct in the history, senor bachelor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>asked Don Quixote. '' No doubt there is,'' replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>);
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but not anything that will be of the same importance as those I have mentioned. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does the author promise a second part at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has not found it, nor does he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it will appear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second part has ever been good, and others that enough has been already written about Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part; though some, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, `Let us have more Quixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter what it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) does promise one,'' replied Samson; '' '' And what does the author mean to do?'' said Don Quixote. <div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>replied Samson; <div class="bookquote">``why, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has found the history which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will at once give it to the press, moved more by the profit that may accrue to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) from doing so than by any thought of praise.
<p/>It will be a wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) succeeds, for it will be only hurry, hurry, with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), like the tailor on Easter Eve; and works done in a hurry are never finished as perfectly as they ought to be.
<p/>Let master Moor, or whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) is, pay attention to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) is doing, and I and my master will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) as much grouting ready to his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) hand, in the way of adventures and accidents of all sorts, as would make up not only one second part, but a hundred.
<p/>The good man fancies, no doubt, that we are fast asleep in the straw here, but let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hold up our feet to be shod and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will see which foot it is we go lame on.
<p/>All I say is, that if my master would take my advice, we would be now afield, redressing outrages and righting wrongs, as is the use and custom of good knights-errant.
<p/>Sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of Rocinante fell upon their ears, which neighing Don Quixote accepted as a happy omen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time.
<p/>Announcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) intention to the bachelor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) advice as to the quarter in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ought to commence his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) expedition, and the bachelor replied that in his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) ought to go to the kingdom of Aragon, and the city of Saragossa, where there were to be certain solemn joustings at the festival of St. George, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might win renown above all the knights of Aragon, which would be winning it above all the knights of the world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) commended his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) very praiseworthy and gallant resolution, but admonished him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to proceed with greater caution in encountering dangers, because his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) life did not belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), but to all those who had need of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to protect and aid them in their misfortunes.
<p/>There's where it is, what I abominate, Senor Samson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Sancho here; <div class="bookquote">``my master will attack a hundred armed men as a greedy boy would half a dozen melons.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Whereat Sancho observed, <div class="bookquote">``The author looks for money and profit, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' Body of the world, senor bachelor!
<p/>there is a time to attack and a time to retreat, and it is not to be always `Santiago, and close Spain!'
<p/>Moreover, I have heard it said -LRB-and I think by my master himself, if I remember rightly-RRB- that the mean of valour lies between the extremes of cowardice and rashness; and if that be so, I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to fly without having good reason, or to attack when the odds make it better not.
<p/>But, above all things, I warn my master that if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is to take me with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) it must be on the condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is to do all the fighting, and that I am not to be called upon to do anything except what concerns keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) clean and comfortable; in this I will dance attendance on him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) readily; but to expect me to draw sword, even against rascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle.
<p/>I don't set up to be a fighting man, Senor Samson, but only the best and most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant; and if my master Don Quixote, in consideration of my many faithful services, is pleased to give me some island of the many his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) worship says one may stumble on in these parts, I will take it as a great favour; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) does not give it to me, I was born like everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence on anyone except God; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, and perhaps even better, without a government than if I were a governor; and how do I know but that in these governments the devil may have prepared some trip for me, to make me lose my footing and fall and knock my grinders out?
<p/>But for all that, if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island or something else of the kind, without much trouble and without much risk, I am not such a fool as to refuse it; for they say, too, `when they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; and `when good luck comes to thee, take it in.'
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Brother Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Carrasco, <div class="bookquote">``you have spoken like a professor; but, for all that, put your trust in God and in Senor Don Quixote, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all the same, be it more or be it less,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho; ``though I can tell Senor Carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might give me into a sack all in holes; for I have felt my own pulse and I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands; and I have before now told my master as much.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Samson; <div class="bookquote">``honours change manners, and perhaps when you find yourself a governor you won't know the mother that bore you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><p/>That may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``not of those who have the fat of an old Christian four fingers deep on their souls, as I have.
<p/>Sancho I was born and Sancho I mean to die. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' Nay, only look at my disposition, is that likely to show ingratitude to anyone?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God grant it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``we shall see when the government comes; and I seem to see it already. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) then begged the bachelor, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) were a poet, to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the favour of composing some verses for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) conveying the farewell he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant to take of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) name was placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses, <div class="bookquote">``Dulcinea del Toboso''  (<font color='red'><b>lady Dulcinea/Dulcinea/lady Dulcinea del Toboso</b></font>)</div>might be read by putting together the first letters.
<p/>The bachelor replied that although he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was not one of the famous poets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) would not fail to compose the required verses; though he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) saw a great difficulty in the task, as the letters which made up the name were seventeen; so, if he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, there would be a letter over, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) made them of five, what they called decimas or redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) would try to drop a letter as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) could, so that the name <div class="bookquote">``Dulcinea del Toboso''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>might be got into four ballad stanzas.
<p/>It must be, by some means or other,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for unless the name stands there plain and manifest, no woman would believe the verses were made for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Don Quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a secret, especially from the curate and Master Nicholas, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) niece and the housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) praiseworthy and valiant purpose.
<p/>Carrasco promised all, and then took his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) leave, charging Don Quixote to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) good or evil fortunes whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had an opportunity; and thus they bade each other farewell, and Sancho went away to make the necessary preparations for their expedition.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' They agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in three days from that time. CHAPTER V. OF THE SHREWD AND DROLL CONVERSATION
<p/>The translator of this history, when he (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) comes to write this fifth chapter, says that he (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) considers it apocryphal, because in it Sancho Panza speaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected from his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) limited intelligence, and says things so subtle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) does not think it possible he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) could have conceived them; however, desirous of doing what his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) task imposed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was unwilling to leave it untranslated, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) went on to say:
<p/>Sancho came home in such glee and spirits that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wife noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) happiness a bowshot off, so much so that it made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``What have you got, Sancho friend, that you are so glad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>To which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Wife, if it were God's will, I should be very glad not to be so well pleased as I show myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you, husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I don't know what you mean by saying you would be glad, if it were God's will, not to be well pleased; for, fool as I am, I don't know how one can find pleasure in not having it.
<p/>Hark ye, Teresa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad because I have made up my mind to go back to the service of my master Don Quixote, who means to go out a third time to seek for adventures; and I am going with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) again, for my necessities will have it so, and also the hope that cheers me with the thought that I may find another hundred crowns like those we have spent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and the children; and if God would be pleased to let me have my daily bread, dry-shod and at home, without taking me out into the byways and cross-roads--and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could do it at small cost by merely willing it--
<p/>it is clear my happiness would be more solid and lasting, for the happiness I have is mingled with sorrow at leaving thee; so that I was right in saying I would be glad, if it were God's will, not to be well pleased.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Teresa; <div class="bookquote">``ever since you joined on to a knight-errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is no understanding you.''

<p/>THAT PASSED BETWEEN SANCHO PANZA AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) WIFE TERESA PANZA, AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF BEING DULY RECORDED ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I know well enough, husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Teresa, ``that squires-errant don't eat their bread for nothing, and

<p/>How many there are in the world who live without a government, and continue to live all the same, and are reckoned in the number of the people.
<p/>The best sauce in the world is hunger, and as the poor are never without that, they always eat with a relish.
<p/>so I will be always praying to our Lord to deliver you speedily from all that hard fortune. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' But mind, Sancho, if by good luck you should find yourself with some government, don't forget me and your children.
<p/>Remember that Sanchico is now full fifteen, and it is right he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should go to school, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) uncle the abbot has a mind to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) trained for the Church.
<p/>Consider, too, that your daughter Mari-Sancha will not die of grief if we marry her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); for I have my suspicions that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is as eager to get a husband as you to get a government; and, after all, a daughter looks better ill married than well whored.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>, that is the safest plan; for if you put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) out of wooden clogs into high-heeled shoes, out of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk gowns, out of the plain `Marica' and `thou,' into `Dona So-and-so' and `my lady,' the girl won't know where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is, and at every turn she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will fall into a thousand blunders that will show the thread of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) coarse homespun stuff.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut, you fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``it will be only to practise it for two or three years; and then dignity and decorum will fit her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as easily as a glove; and if not, what matter?

<p/>Do you bring home money, Sancho, and leave marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to my care; there is Lope Tocho, Juan Tocho's son, a stout, sturdy young fellow that we know, and I can see he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) does not look sour at the girl; and with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), one of our own sort, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will be well married, and we shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always under our eyes, and be all one family, parents and children, grandchildren and sons-in-law, and the peace and blessing of God will dwell among us; so don't you go marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in those courts and grand palaces where they won't know what to make of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) what to make of herself.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you idiot and wife for Barabbas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``what do you mean by trying, without why or wherefore, to keep me from marrying my daughter to one who will give me grandchildren that will be called `your lordship'?
<p/>Look ye, Teresa, I have always heard my elders say that he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) who does not know how to take advantage of luck when it comes to him (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>), has no right to complain if it gives him (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) the go-by; and now that it is knocking at our door, it will not do to shut it out; let us go with the favouring breeze that blows upon us.
<p/>It is this sort of talk, and what Sancho says lower down, that made the translator of the history say he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) considered this chapter apocryphal.

<p/>You do as you like, make a duchess or a princess of her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), but I can tell you it will not be with my will and consent.
<p/>I was always a lover of equality, brother, and I can't bear to see people give themselves airs without any right.
<p/>They called me Teresa at my baptism, a plain, simple name, without any additions or tags or fringes of Dons or Donas; Cascajo was my father's name, and as I am your wife, I am called Teresa Panza, though by right
<p/>I ought to be called Teresa Cascajo; but `kings go where laws like,' and I am content with this name without having the `Don' put on top of it to make it so heavy that I cannot carry it; and I don't want to make people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countess or governor's wife; for they will say at once, `See what airs the slut gives herself!
<p/>Only yesterday she (<font color='blue'><b>slut</b></font>) was always spinning flax, and used to go to mass with the tail of her (<font color='blue'><b>slut</b></font>) petticoat over her (<font color='blue'><b>slut</b></font>) head instead of a mantle, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>slut</b></font>) goes to-day in a hooped gown with her (<font color='blue'><b>slut</b></font>) broaches and airs, as if we didn't know her (<font color='blue'><b>slut</b></font>)!'
<p/>If God keeps me in my seven senses, or five, or whatever number I have, I am not going to bring myself to such a pass; go you, brother, and be a government or an island man, and swagger as much as you like; for by the soul of my mother, neither my daughter nor I are going to stir a step from our village; a respectable woman should have a broken leg and keep at home; and to be busy at something is a virtuous damsel's holiday; be off to your adventures along with your Don Quixote, and leave us to our misadventures, for God will mend them for us according as we deserve it.
<p/>I don't know , I'm sure, who fixed the `Don' to him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), what neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) father nor grandfather ever had. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' God help thee, what a lot of things thou hast strung together, one after the other, without head or tail!
<p/>What have Cascajo, and the broaches and the proverbs and the airs, to do with what I say? Look here, fool and dolt -LRB-for so I may call you,
<p/>when you don't understand my words, and run away from good fortune-RRB-, if I had said that my daughter was to throw herself down from a tower, or go roaming the world, as the Infanta Dona Urraca wanted to do, you would be right in not giving way to my will; but if in an instant, in less than the twinkling of an eye, I put the `Don' and `my lady' on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back, and take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) out of the stubble, and place her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) under a canopy, on a dais, and on a couch, with more velvet cushions than all the Almohades of Morocco ever had in their family, why won't you consent and fall in with my wishes?''
<p/>At the poor man people only throw a hasty glance; on the rich man they fix their eyes; and if the said rich man was once on a time poor, it is then
<p/>there is the sneering and the tattle and spite of backbiters; and in the streets here they swarm as thick as bees.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Teresa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``and listen to what I am now going to say to you; maybe you never heard it in all your life; and I do not give my own notions, for what I am about to say are the opinions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) reverence the preacher, who preached in this town last Lent, and who said, if I remember rightly, that all things present that our eyes behold, bring themselves before us, and remain and fix themselves on our memory much better and more forcibly than things past.
<p/>These observations which Sancho makes here are the other ones on account of which the translator says he (<font color='blue'><b>translator</b></font>) regards this chapter as apocryphal, inasmuch as they are beyond Sancho's capacity.

<p/>Sancho consoled her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) by saying that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) must make her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) a countess, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would put it off as long as possible.
<p/>Here their conversation came to an end, and Sancho went back to see Don Quixote, and make arrangements for their departure.
<p/>OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER; ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY
<p/>While Sancho Panza and his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) wife, Teresa Cascajo, held the above irrelevant conversation, Don Quixote's niece and housekeeper were not idle, for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and master meant to give them the slip the third time, and once more betake himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), for them, ill-errant chivalry.
<p/>They strove by all the means in their power to divert him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) from such an unlucky scheme; but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron.
<p/>Nevertheless, among many other representations made to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), the housekeeper said to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), ``In truth, master, if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home, and give over roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit, looking for what they say are called adventures, but what I call misfortunes, I shall have to make complaint to God and the king with loud supplication to send some remedy.
<p/>To which Don Quixote replied, <div class="bookquote">``What answer God will give to your complaints, housekeeper, I know not, nor what his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Majesty will answer either; I only know that if I were king I should decline to answer the numberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of the greatest among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen to all and answer all, and therefore I should be sorry that any affairs of mine should worry him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Then we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' CHAPTER VI. '' Whereupon the housekeeper said, <div class="bookquote">``Tell us, senor, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Majesty's court are there no knights?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>There are,'' replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and plenty of them; and it is right there should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, and for the greater glory of the king's majesty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Then might not your worship,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``be one of those that, without stirring a step, serve their king and lord in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) court?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Recollect, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``all knights cannot be courtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor need they be.
<p/>There must be all sorts in the world; and though we may be all knights, there is a great difference between one and another; for the courtiers, without quitting their chambers, or the threshold of the court, range the world over by looking at a map, without its costing them a farthing, and without suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst; but we, the true knights-errant, measure the whole earth with our own feet, exposed to the sun, to the cold, to the air, to the inclemencies of heaven, by day and night, on foot and on horseback; nor do we only know enemies in pictures, but in their own real shapes; and at all risks and on all occasions we attack them, without any regard to childish points or rules of single combat, whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword, whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out, and other niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man, that you know nothing about, but I do.
<p/>And you must know besides, that the true knight-errant, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may see ten giants, that not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them, and that go, each of them, on two tall towers by way of legs, and whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships, and each eye like a great mill-wheel, and glowing brighter than a glass furnace, must not on any account be dismayed by them.
<p/>On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart, and, if possible, vanquish and destroy them, even though they have for armour the shells of a certain fish, that they say are harder than diamonds, and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of Damascus steel, or clubs studded with spikes also of steel, such as I have more than once seen.
<p/>All this I say, housekeeper, that you may see the difference there is between the one sort of knight and the other; and it would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on this second, or more properly speaking first, kind of knights-errant; for, as we read in their histories, there have been some among them who have been the salvation, not merely of one kingdom, but of many.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div>here exclaimed the niece, <div class="bookquote">``remember that all this you are saying about knights-errant is fable and fiction; and their histories, if indeed they were not burned, would deserve, each of them, to have a sambenito put on it, or some mark by which it might be known as infamous and a corrupter of good manners.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the God that gives me life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``if thou wert not my full niece, being daughter of my own sister, I would inflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the world should ring with.
<p/>can it be that a young hussy that hardly knows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) tongue and criticise the histories of knights-errant?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), however, no doubt would forgive thee, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) time, and moreover a great protector of damsels; but some there are that might have heard thee, and it would not have been well for thee in that case; for they are not all courteous or mannerly; some are ill-conditioned scoundrels; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman, that is
<p/>so in all respects; some are gold, others pinchbeck, and all look like gentlemen, but not all can stand the touchstone of truth.
<p/>There are men of low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen, and high gentlemen who, one would fancy, were dying to pass for men of low rank; the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues, the latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by their vices; and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen, so much alike in name and so different in conduct.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div>said the niece, <div class="bookquote">``that you should know so much, uncle--enough, if need be, to get up into a pulpit and go preach in the streets--and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are old, strong when you are sickly, able to put straight what is crooked when you yourself are bent by age, and, above all, a caballero when you are not one; for though gentlefolk may be so, poor men are nothing of the kind!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the niece</b></font>)</div><p/>There is a great deal of truth in what you say, niece,'' returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and I could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish you; but, not to mix up things human and divine, I refrain.
<p/>Look you, my dears, all the lineages in the world -LRB-attend to what I am saying-RRB- can be reduced to four sorts, which are these: those that had humble beginnings, and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained surpassing greatness; those that had great beginnings and maintained them, and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin; those, again, that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid, having reduced and lessened their original greatness till it has come to nought, like the point of a pyramid, which, relatively to its base or foundation, is nothing; and then there are those--and it is they that are the most numerous--that have had neither an illustrious beginning nor a remarkable mid-course, and so will have an end without a name, like an ordinary plebeian line.
<p/>Of the first, those that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve, the Ottoman house may serve as an example, which from an humble and lowly shepherd, its founder, has reached the height at which we now see it.
<p/>For examples of the second sort of lineage, that began with greatness and maintains it still without adding to it, there are the many princes who have inherited the dignity, and maintain themselves in their inheritance, without increasing or diminishing it, keeping peacefully within the limits of their states.
<p/>Of those that began great and ended in a point, there are thousands of examples, for all the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt, the Caesars of Rome, and the whole herd -LRB-if I may apply such a word to them-RRB- of countless princes, monarchs, lords, Medes, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and barbarians, all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come to nothing, they themselves as well as their founders, for it would be impossible now to find one of their descendants, and, even should we find one, it would be in some lowly and humble condition.
<p/>Of plebeian lineages I have nothing to say, save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live, without any eminence to entitle them to any fame or praise beyond this.
<p/>From all I have said I would have you gather, my poor innocents, that great is the confusion among lineages, and that only those are seen to be great and illustrious that show themselves so by the virtue, wealth, and generosity of their possessors.
<p/>I have said virtue, wealth, and generosity, because a great man who is vicious will be a great example of vice, and a rich man who is not generous will be merely a miserly beggar; for the possessor of wealth is not made happy by possessing it, but by spending it, and not by spending as he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) pleases, but by knowing how to spend it well.
<p/>The poor gentleman has no way of showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a gentleman but by virtue, by being affable, well-bred, courteous, gentle-mannered, and kindly, not haughty, arrogant, or censorious, but above all by being charitable; for by two maravedis given with a cheerful heart to the poor, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will show himself as generous as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) who distributes alms with bell-ringing, and no one that perceives him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to be endowed with the virtues I have named, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) know him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) not, will fail to recognise and set him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) down as one of good blood; and it would be strange were it not so; praise has ever been the reward of virtue, and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation.
<p/>There are two roads, my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and honours; one is that of letters, the other that of arms.
<p/>I have more of arms than of letters in my composition, and, judging by my inclination to arms, was born under the influence of the planet Mars.
<p/>I am, therefore, in a measure constrained to follow that road, and by it I must travel in spite of all the world, and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills, fate ordains, reason requires, and, above all, my own inclination favours; for knowing as I do the countless toils that are the accompaniments of knight-errantry, I know, too, the infinite blessings that are attained by it
<p/>; I know that the path of virtue is very narrow, and the road of vice broad and spacious; I know their ends and goals are different, for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death, and the narrow and toilsome one of virtue in life, and not transitory life, but in that which has no end; I know, as our great Castilian poet says, that--

<p/>At this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked who was there, Sancho Panza made answer that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>).
<p/>The instant the housekeeper knew who it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) ran to hide herself so as not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>); in such abhorrence did she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>).

<p/>The first time he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was brought back to us slung across the back of an ass, and belaboured all over; and the second time he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) came in an ox-cart, shut up in a cage, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) persuaded himself he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was enchanted, and the poor creature was in such a state that the mother that bore him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) would not have known him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>); lean, yellow, with his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) eyes sunk deep in the cells of his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) skull; so that to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) round again, ever so little, cost me more than six hundred eggs, as God knows, and all the world, and my hens too, that won't let me tell a lie.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I can well believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bachelor</b></font>)</div>replied the bachelor, <div class="bookquote">``for they are so good and so fat, and so well-bred, that they would not say one thing for another, though they were to burst for it.
<p/>In short then, mistress housekeeper, that is all, and there is nothing the matter, except what it is feared Don Quixote may do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bachelor</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Whereabouts is he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) breaking out, senora? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>asked Samson; <div class="bookquote">``has any part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) body burst?''

<p/>Well then,'' returned the bachelor, <div class="bookquote">``don't be uneasy, but go home in peace; get me ready something hot for breakfast, and while you are on the way say the prayer of Santa Apollonia, that is
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the bachelor</b></font>)</div>if you know it; for I will come presently and you will see miracles.'' <div class="bookquote">``Woe is me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>cried the housekeeper, <div class="bookquote">``is it the prayer of Santa Apollonia you would have me say?
<p/>That would do if it was the toothache my master had; but it is in the brains, what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) has got.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know what I am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don't set yourself to argue with me, for you know
<p/>I am a bachelor of Salamanca, and one can't be more of a bachelor than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>replied Carrasco; and with this the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went to look for the curate, and arrange with him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) what will be told in its proper place.
<p/>While Don Quixote and Sancho were shut up together, they had a discussion which the history records with great precision and scrupulous exactness.
<p/>Sancho said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, I have educed my wife to let me go with your worship wherever you choose to take me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once or twice, as well as I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, ``I have begged of your worship not to mend my words, if so be as you understand what I mean by them; and if you don't understand them to say `Sancho,' or `devil,' 'I don't understand thee; and if I don't make my meaning plain, then you may correct me, for I am so focile-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Induced, you should say, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``not educed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' I don't understand thee, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote at once;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``for I know not what 'I am so focile' means. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>''`So focile' means I am so much that way,'' replied Sancho.
<p/>Well, if you can't understand me,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how to put it; I know no more, God help me.
<p/>Oh, now I have hit it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``thou wouldst say thou art so docile, tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what I say to thee, and submit to what I teach thee.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would bet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that from the very first you understood me, and knew what I meant, but you wanted to put me out that you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>I understand thee still less now,'' said Don Quixote. '' '' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``May be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but to come to the point, what does Teresa say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Teresa says,'' replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that I should make sure with your worship, and `let papers speak and beards be still,' for `he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who binds does not wrangle,' since one `take' is better than two `I'll give thee's;' and I say a woman's advice is no great thing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who won't take it is a fool.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact is,'' continued Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that, as your worship knows better than I do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we are, and to-morrow
<p/>we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than God may be pleased to give him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); for death is deaf, and when it comes to knock at our life's door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, nor struggles, nor sceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common talk and report say, and as they tell us from the pulpits every day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' And so say I,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``continue, Sancho my friend; go on; you talk pearls to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' ''
<p/>What I am driving at,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``is that your worship settle some fixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while I am in your service, and that the same be paid me out of your estate; for I don't care to stand on rewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all; God help me with my own.
<p/>In short, I would like to know what I am to get, be it much or little; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littles make a much, and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost.
<p/>To be sure, if it should happen -LRB-what I neither believe nor expect-RRB- that your worship were to give me that island you have promised me, I am not so ungrateful nor so grasping but that I would be willing to have the revenue of such island valued and stopped out of my wages in due promotion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>All that is very true,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but I cannot make out what thou art driving at. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Sancho, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``sometimes proportion may be as good as promotion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I'll bet I ought to have said proportion, and not promotion; but it is no matter, as your worship has understood me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>And so well understood,'' returned Don Quixote, ``that I have seen into the depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs.
<p/>Look here, Sancho, I would readily fix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the histories of the knights-errant to show or indicate, by the slightest hint, what their squires used to get monthly or yearly; but I have read all or the best part of their histories, and I cannot remember reading of any knight-errant having assigned fixed wages to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) squire; I only know that they all served on reward, and that when they least expected it, if good luck attended their masters, they found themselves recompensed with an island or something equivalent to it, or at the least they were left with a title and lordship.
<p/>If with these hopes and additional inducements you, Sancho, please to return to my service, well and good; but to suppose that I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of knight-errantry, is all nonsense.
<p/>And so, my Sancho, get you back to your house and explain my intentions to your Teresa, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) likes and you like to be on reward with me, bene quidem; if not, we remain friends; for if the pigeon-house does not lack food, it will not lack pigeons; and bear in mind, my son, that a good hope is better than a bad holding, and a good grievance better than a bad compensation.
<p/>I speak in this way, Sancho, to show you that I can shower down proverbs just as well as yourself; and in short, I mean to say, and I do say, that if you don't like to come on reward with me, and run the same chance that I run, God be with you and make a saint of you
<p/>; for I shall find plenty of squires more obedient and painstaking, and not so thickheaded or talkative as you are.
<p/>When Sancho heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's firm, resolute language, a cloud came over the sky with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and the wings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart drooped, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had made sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master would not go without him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) for all the wealth of the world; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stood there dumbfoundered and moody, Samson Carrasco came in with the housekeeper and niece, who were anxious to hear by what arguments he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) was about to dissuade their master from going to seek adventures.
<p/>The arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) had done before, said with a loud voice, ``O flower of knight-errantry!
<p/>may God Almighty in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) infinite power grant that any person or persons, who would impede or hinder thy third sally, may find no way out of the labyrinth of their schemes, nor ever accomplish what they most desire!
<p/>And then, turning to the housekeeper, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, ``Mistress housekeeper may just as well give over saying the prayer of Santa Apollonia, for I know it is the positive determination of the spheres that Senor Don Quixote shall proceed to put into execution his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) new and lofty designs; and I should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did I not urge and persuade this knight not to keep the might of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) strong arm and the virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) valiant spirit any longer curbed and checked, for by his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) inactivity he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs, of the protection of orphans, of the honour of virgins, of the aid of widows, and of the support of wives, and other matters of this kind appertaining, belonging, proper and peculiar to the order of knight-errantry.
<p/>On, then, my lord Don Quixote, beautiful and brave, let your worship and highness set out to-day rather than to-morrow; and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose, here am I ready in person and purse to supply the want; and were it requisite to attend your magnificence as squire, I should esteem it the happiest good fortune.
<p/>At this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, <div class="bookquote">``Did I not tell thee, Sancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me?
<p/>See now who offers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor Samson Carrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancan schools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger or thirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant's squire!
<p/>But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I should shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, and cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts.
<p/>Let this new Samson remain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring honour at the same time on the grey heads of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) venerable parents; for I will be content with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho does not deign to accompany me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do deign,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes; <div class="bookquote">``it shall not be said of me, master mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) continued, ''`the bread eaten and the company dispersed.'
<p/>Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for all the world knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whom I am descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, by many good words and deeds, your worship's desire to show me favour; and if I have been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only to please my wife, who, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sets herself to press a point, no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drives one to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wants; but, after all, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am a man anyhow, which I can't deny, I will be one in my own house too, let who will take it amiss; and so there's nothing more to do
<p/>but for your worship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it can't be provoked, and let us set out at once, to save Senor Samson's soul from suffering, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) says his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) conscience obliges him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) to persuade your worship to sally out upon the world a third time; so I offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally, as well and better than all the squires that served knights-errant in times past or present.
<p/>The bachelor was filled with amazement when he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) heard Sancho's phraseology and style of talk, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had read the first part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's history he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) never thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could be so droll as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was there described; but now, hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) talk of a <div class="bookquote">``will and codicil that could not be provoked,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>instead of <div class="bookquote">``will and codicil that could not be revoked,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) believed all he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had read of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) down as one of the greatest simpletons of modern times; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to himself that two such lunatics as master and man the world had never seen.
<p/>In fine, Don Quixote and Sancho embraced one another and made friends, and by the advice and with the approval of the great Carrasco, who was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence, by which time they could have all that was requisite for the journey ready, and procure a closed helmet, which Don Quixote said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must by all means take.
<p/>Samson offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) one, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) knew a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) who had it would not refuse it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>), though it was more dingy with rust and mildew than bright and clean like burnished steel.
<p/>The curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor were past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they raised a lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as if it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) death.
<p/>Samson's intention in persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by the advice of the curate and barber, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) had previously discussed the subject.
<p/>Finally, then, during those three days, Don Quixote and Sancho provided themselves with what they considered necessary, and Sancho having pacified his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wife, and Don Quixote his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) niece and housekeeper, at nightfall, unseen by anyone except the bachelor, who thought fit to accompany them half a league out of the village, they set out for El Toboso, Don Quixote on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) good Rocinante and Sancho on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) old Dapple, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) purse with money that Don Quixote gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to meet emergencies.
<p/>Samson embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>), and entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) good or evil fortunes, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) might rejoice over the former or condole with him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) over the latter, as the laws of friendship required.
<p/>Don Quixote promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would do so, and Samson returned to the village, and the other two took the road for the great city of El Toboso.

<p/>WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE ON HIS (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>) WAY TO SEE HIS (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>) LADY DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO <div class="bookquote">``Blessed be Allah the all-powerful!''  (<font color='red'><b>LADY</b></font>)</div>says Hamete Benengeli on beginning this eighth chapter; ``blessed be Allah!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) repeats three times; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) utters these thanksgivings at seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allah</b></font>) has now got Don Quixote and Sancho fairly afield, and that the readers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) delightful history may reckon that the achievements and humours of Don Quixote and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire are now about to begin; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) urges them to forget the former chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fix their eyes on those that are to come, which now begin on the road to El Toboso, as the others began on the plains of Montiel; nor is it much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montiel</b></font>) asks in consideration of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Montiel</b></font>) promises, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Montiel</b></font>) goes on to say: Don Quixote and Sancho were left alone, and the moment Samson took his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) departure, Rocinante began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, by both knight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen; though, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of Dapple were louder than the neighings of the hack, from which Sancho inferred that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, building, perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) may have known, though the history says nothing about it; all that can be said is, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stumbled or fell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was heard to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had not come out, for by stumbling or falling there was nothing to be got but a damaged shoe or a broken rib; and, fool as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was not much astray in this.
<p/>Said Don Quixote, ``Sancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us as we go, and more darkly than will allow us to reach El Toboso by daylight; for there I am resolved to go before I engage in another adventure, and there I shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of the peerless Dulcinea, with which permission I expect and feel assured that I shall conclude and bring to a happy termination every perilous adventure; for nothing in life makes knights-errant more valorous than finding themselves favoured by their ladies.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I think it will be difficult for your worship to speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) or see her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), at any rate where you will be able to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) blessing; unless, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) throws it over the wall of the yard where I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) the time before, when I took her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) the letter that told of the follies and mad things your worship was doing in the heart of Sierra Morena.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Didst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``where or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently extolled grace and beauty?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' So I believe,'' replied Sancho; '' It must have been the gallery, corridor, or portico of some rich and royal palace.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It might have been all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but to me it looked like a wall, unless I am short of memory.''

<p/>Well, to tell the truth, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``when I saw that sun of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, it was not bright enough to throw out beams at all; it must have been, that as her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) grace was sifting that wheat I told you of, the thick dust she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) raised came before her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) face like a cloud and dimmed it.
<p/>dost thou still persist, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``in saying, thinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady Dulcinea was sifting wheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at variance with what is and should be the employment of persons of distinction, who are constituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show their rank a bowshot off?
<p/>wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) paints for us how, in their crystal abodes, those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved Tagus and seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which the ingenious poet there describes to us, how they were worked and woven with gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sort must have been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), only that the spite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of mine changes all those things that give me pleasure, and turns them into shapes unlike their own; and
<p/>so I fear that in that history of my achievements which they say is now in print, if haply its author was some sage who is an enemy of mine, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) will have put one thing for another, mingling a thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself by relating transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true history.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``What! Thou hast forgotten, O Sancho, those lines of our poet O envy, root of all countless evils, and cankerworm of the virtues!
<p/>All the vices, Sancho, bring some kind of pleasure with them; but envy brings nothing but irritation, bitterness, and rage. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>So I say too,'' replied Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and I suspect in that legend or history of us that the bachelor Samson Carrasco told us he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) saw, my honour goes dragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down, sweeping the streets, as they say.
<p/>And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I never spoke ill of any enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am to be envied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of the rogue in me; but all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity, always natural and never acted; and if I had no other merit save that I believe, as I always do, firmly and truly in God, and all the holy Roman Catholic Church holds and believes, and that I am a mortal enemy of the Jews, the historians ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their writings.
<p/>But let them say what they like; naked was I born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain; nay, while I see myself put into a book and passed on from hand to hand over the world, I don't care a fig, let them say what they like of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That, Sancho,'' returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``reminds me of what happened to a famous poet of our own day, who, having written a bitter satire against all the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name in it a certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was one or not.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), seeing she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not in the list of the poet, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) had seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) did not include her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the number of the others, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) must add to his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) satire and put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the new part, or else look out for the consequences.
<p/>The poet did as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>), and left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) without a shred of reputation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was satisfied by getting fame though it was infamy.
<p/>In keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd who set fire to the famous temple of Diana, by repute one of the seven wonders of the world, and burned it with the sole object of making his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) name live in after ages; and, though it was forbidden to name him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), or mention his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) name by word of mouth or in writing, lest the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) ambition should be attained, nevertheless it became known that he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was called Erostratus.
<p/>And something of the same sort is what happened in the case of the great emperor Charles V and a gentleman in Rome.
<p/>The emperor was anxious to see that famous temple of the Rotunda, called in ancient times the temple `of all the gods,' but now-a-days, by a better nomenclature, `of all the saints,' which is the best preserved building of all those of pagan construction in Rome, and the one which best sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of its founders.
<p/>It is in the form of a half orange, of enormous dimensions, and well lighted, though no light penetrates it save that which is admitted by a window, or rather round skylight, at the top; and it was from this that the emperor examined the building.
<p/>A Roman gentleman stood by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) side and explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) the skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful architecture, and when they had left the skylight he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said to the emperor, 'A thousand times, your Sacred Majesty, the impulse came upon me to seize your Majesty in my arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight, so as to leave behind me in the world a name that would last for ever.' '
<p/>I am thankful to you for not carrying such an evil thought into effect,' said the emperor, `and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again putting your loyalty to the test; and I therefore forbid you ever to speak to me or to be where I am; and he (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) followed up these words by bestowing a liberal bounty upon him (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>).
<p/>What, thinkest thou, was it that flung Horatius in full armour down from the bridge into the depths of the Tiber?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>My meaning is, Sancho, that the desire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive. What burned the hand and arm of Mutius?
<p/>What impelled Curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that opened in the midst of Rome? What, in opposition to all the omens that declared against him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), made Julius Caesar cross the Rubicon?
<p/>And to come to more modern examples, what scuttled the ships, and left stranded and cut off the gallant Spaniards under the command of the most courteous Cortes in the New World?
<p/>All these and a variety of other great exploits are, were and will be, the work of fame that mortals desire as a reward and a portion of the immortality their famous deeds deserve; though we Catholic Christians and knights-errant look more to that future glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than to the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this present transitory life; a fame that, however long it may last, must after all end with the world itself, which has its own appointed end.
<p/>So that, O Sancho, in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the Christian religion we profess has assigned to us.
<p/>We have to slay pride in giants, envy by generosity and nobleness of heart, anger by calmness of demeanour and equanimity, gluttony and sloth by the spareness of our diet and the length of our vigils, lust and lewdness by the loyalty we preserve to those whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts, indolence by traversing the world in all directions seeking opportunities of making ourselves, besides Christians, famous knights.
<p/>Such, Sancho, are the means by which we reach those extremes of praise that fair fame carries with it. '' ''
<p/>All that your worship has said so far,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I have understood quite well; but still I would be glad if your worship would dissolve a doubt for me, which has just this minute come into my mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``say on, in God's name, and I will answer as well as I can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Sancho went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``those Julys or Augusts, and all those venturous knights that you say are now dead--where are they now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The heathens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``are, no doubt, in hell; the Christians, if they were good Christians, are either in purgatory or in heaven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>``but now I want to know--the tombs where the bodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps before them, or are the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches, winding-sheets, tresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax?
<p/>To which Don Quixote made answer: <div class="bookquote">``The tombs of the heathens were generally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius Caesar's body were placed on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call in Rome Saint Peter's needle.
<p/>The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a castle as large as a good-sized village, which they called the Moles Adriani, and is now the castle of St. Angelo in Rome.
<p/>The queen Artemisia buried her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) husband Mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world; but none of these tombs, or of the many others of the heathens, were ornamented with winding-sheets or any of those other offerings and tokens that show that they who are buried there are saints.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>That's the point I'm coming to,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and now tell me, which is the greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; Or what are they ornamented with? '' '' '' The answer is easy,'' replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``it is a greater work to bring to life a dead man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I have got you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``in that case the fame of them who bring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure cripples, restore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are lamps burning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their knees adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the other than that which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that have ever been in the world have left or may leave behind them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you call it,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``belong to the bodies and relics of the saints who, with the approbation and permission of our holy mother Church, have lamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, by means of which they increase devotion and add to their own Christian reputation.
<p/>Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on their shoulders, and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn their oratories and favourite altars with them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>That I grant, too,'' said Don Quixote. '' '' '' What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?
<p/>My meaning is,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``let us set about becoming saints, and we shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after; for you know, senor, yesterday or the day before yesterday -LRB-for it is
<p/>so lately one may say so-RRB- they canonised and beatified two little barefoot friars, and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss or touch the iron chains with which they girt and tortured their bodies, and they are held in greater veneration, so it is said, than the sword of Roland in the armoury of our lord the King, whom God preserve.
<p/>So that, senor, it is better to be an humble little friar of no matter what order, than a valiant knight-errant; with God a couple of dozen of penance lashings are of more avail than two thousand lance-thrusts, be they given to giants, or monsters, or dragons.
<p/>All that is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but we cannot all be friars, and many are the ways by which God takes his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own to heaven; chivalry is a religion, there are sainted knights in glory.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>asked Don Quixote. '' '' '' '' '' Yes,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but I have heard say that there are more friars in heaven than knights-errant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``is because those in religious orders are more numerous than knights.''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' The errants are many,'' said Sancho.
<p/>With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that night and the following day, without anything worth mention happening to them, whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the next day, at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso, at the sight of which Don Quixote's spirits rose and Sancho's fell, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not know Dulcinea's house, nor in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) life had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), any more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), the other at not having seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), and Sancho was at a loss to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was to do when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to El Toboso.
<p/>In the end, Don Quixote made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited until the time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; and when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entrance into the city, where something happened them that may fairly be called something.
<p/>'' Many,'' replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but few they who deserve the name of knights. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER IX. WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT
<p/>WILL BE SEEN THERE 'Twas at the very midnight hour--more or less--when Don Quixote and Sancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso.
<p/>The town was in deep silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad of their backs, as the saying is.
<p/>The night was darkish, though Sancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the darkness an excuse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) blundering.
<p/>All over the place nothing was to be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of Don Quixote and troubled the heart of Sancho.
<p/>Now and then an ass brayed, pigs grunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they made seemed louder in the silence of the night;
<p/>all which the enamoured knight took to be of evil omen; nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Sancho, my son, lead on to the palace of Dulcinea, it may be that we shall find her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) awake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>what palace am I to lead to,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``when what I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) highness in was only a very little house?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Most likely she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had then withdrawn into some small apartment of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) palace,'' said Don Quixote, ``to amuse herself with damsels, as great ladies and princesses are accustomed to do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``if your worship will have it in spite of me that the house of my lady Dulcinea is a palace, is this an hour, think you, to find the door open; and will it be right for us to go knocking till they hear us and open the door; making a disturbance and confusion all through the household?
<p/>Are we going, do you fancy, to the house of our wenches, like gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us first of all find out the palace for certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>gallants</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had best do; but look, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that one sees from here should be Dulcinea's palace.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Body of the sun!

<p/>though I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I'll believe it as much as I believe it is daylight now.
<p/>Don Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred paces he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a great tower, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) perceived that the building in question was no palace, but the chief church of the town, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It's the church we have lit upon, Sancho.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So I see,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and God grant we may not light upon our graves; it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard at this time of night; and that, after my telling your worship, if I don't mistake, that the house of this lady will be in an alley without an outlet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after the bucket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and I may tell you that if you have not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), no more have I.

<p/>While the two were engaged in this conversation, they perceived some one with a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and from the noise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessed him (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) work, and so it proved to be.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came along singing the ballad that says-- Ill did ye fare, ye men of France, In Roncesvalles chase-- <div class="bookquote">``May I die, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if any good will come to us to-night!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might just as well be singing the ballad of Calainos, for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.
<p/>By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is the palace of the peerless princess Dona Dulcinea del Toboso?''

<p/>Sancho was in a fever to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master out of the town, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should discover the falsehood of the reply he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in the Sierra Morena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hastened their departure, which they took at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest or thicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returned to the city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) which demand fresh attention and a new chapter.

<p/>When the author of this great history comes to relate what is set down in this chapter he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) would have preferred to pass it over in silence, fearing it would not be believed, because here Don Quixote's madness reaches the confines of the greatest that can be conceived, and even goes a couple of bowshots beyond the greatest.
<p/>But after all, though still under the same fear and apprehension, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has recorded it without adding to the story or leaving out a particle of the truth, and entirely disregarding the charges of falsehood that might be brought against him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was right, for the truth may run fine but will not break, and always rises above falsehood as oil above water; and so, going on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) says that as soon as Don Quixote had ensconced himself in the forest, oak grove, or wood near El Toboso, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bade Sancho return to the city, and not come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) presence again without having first spoken on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) behalf to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lady, and begged of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that it might be her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) good pleasure to permit herself to be seen by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) enslaved knight, and deign to bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) blessing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might thereby hope for a happy issue in all his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) encounters and difficult enterprises.
<p/>Sancho undertook to execute the task according to the instructions, and to bring back an answer as good as the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) brought back before.
<p/>Go, my son,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and be not dazed when thou findest thyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou art going to seek.

<p/>; if she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) changes colour while thou art giving her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) my message; if she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is agitated and disturbed at hearing my name; if she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) cannot rest upon her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) cushion, shouldst thou haply find her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) seated in the sumptuous state chamber proper to her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rank; and should she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) be standing, observe if she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) poises herself now on one foot, now on the other; if she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) repeats two or three times the reply she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) gives thee; if she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) passes from gentleness to austerity, from asperity to tenderness; if she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) raises her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand to smooth her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hair though it be not disarranged.
<p/>In short, my son, observe all her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) actions and motions, for if thou wilt report them to me as they were, I will gather what she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hides in the recesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) heart as regards my love; for I would have thee know, Sancho, if thou knowest it not, that with lovers the outward actions and motions they give way to when their loves are in question are the faithful messengers that carry the news of what is going on in the depths of their hearts.
<p/>Go, my friend, may better fortune than mine attend thee, and bring thee a happier issue than that which I await in dread in this dreary solitude.

<p/>I say this because, if we could not find my lady's palaces or castles to-night, now that it is daylight I count upon finding them when I least expect it, and once found, leave it to me to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

<p/>With this, Sancho wheeled about and gave Dapple the stick, and Don Quixote remained behind, seated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse, resting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stirrups and leaning on the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance, filled with sad and troubled forebodings; and there we will leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and accompany Sancho, who went off no less serious and troubled than he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master; so much so, that as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had got out of the thicket, and looking round saw that Don Quixote was not within sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) dismounted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ass, and seating himself at the foot of a tree began to commune with himself, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Now, brother Sancho, let us know where your worship is going.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>there are no pegs; and moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it's not looked for. '' Are you going to look for some ass that has been lost?
<p/>I am going to look for a princess, that's all; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) for the sun of beauty and the whole heaven at once.
<p/>Not at all. Then what are you going to look for? And where do you expect to find all this, Sancho?
<p/>For the famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who rights wrongs, gives food to those who thirst and drink to the hungry.
<p/>Where? Why, in the great city of El Toboso. Well, and for whom are you going to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)? That's all very well, but
<p/>do you know her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) house, Sancho? My master says it will be some royal palace or grand castle. And have you ever seen her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) by any chance?
<p/>And does it strike you that it would be just and right if the El Toboso people, finding out that you were here with the intention of going to tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were to come and cudgel your ribs, and not leave a whole bone in you?
<p/>They would, indeed, have very good reason, if they did not see that I am under orders, and that `you are a messenger, my friend, no blame belongs to you.'
<p/>Don't you trust to that, Sancho, for the Manchegan folk are as hot-tempered as they are honest, and won't put up with liberties from anybody.
<p/>Neither I nor my master ever saw her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). By the Lord, if they get scent of you, it will be worse for you, I promise you.
<p/>Why should I go looking for three feet on a cat, to please another man; and what is more, when looking for Dulcinea will be looking for Marica in Ravena, or the bachelor in Salamanca?
<p/>Be off, you scoundrel! Let the bolt fall. The devil, the devil and nobody else, has mixed me up in this business!
<p/>Such was the soliloquy Sancho held with himself, and all the conclusion he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could come to was to say to himself again, <div class="bookquote">``Well, there's remedy for everything except death, under whose yoke we have all to pass, whether we like it or not, when life's finished.
<p/>I have seen by a thousand signs that this master of mine is a madman fit to be tied, and for that matter, I too, am not behind him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); for I'm a greater fool than he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is when I follow him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) and serve him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), if there's any truth in the proverb that says, `Tell me what company thou keepest, and I'll tell thee
<p/>Well then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) be mad, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is, and with a madness that mostly takes one thing for another, and white for black, and black for white, as was seen when he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said the windmills were giants, and the monks' mules dromedaries, flocks of sheep armies of enemies, and much more to the same tune, it will not be very hard to make him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) believe that some country girl, the first I come across here, is the lady Dulcinea; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) does not believe it, I'll swear it; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) should swear, I'll swear again; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) persists I'll persist still more, so as, come what may, to have my quoit always over the peg.
<p/>Maybe, by holding out in this way, I may put a stop to his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) sending me on messages of this kind another time; or maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will think, as I suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will, that one of those wicked enchanters, who he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) says have a spite against him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) form for the sake of doing him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) an ill turn and injuring him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With this reflection Sancho made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mind easy, counting the business as good as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make Don Quixote think he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; and things turned out so luckily for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) got up to mount Dapple, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spied, coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stood, three peasant girls on three colts, or fillies--for the author does not make the point clear, though it is more likely they were she-asses, the usual mount with village girls; but as it is of no great consequence, we need not stop to prove it.
<p/>To be brief, the instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) returned full speed to seek his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sighing and uttering a thousand passionate lamentations.
<p/>'' what thou art,' or in that other, `Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed.' When Don Quixote saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exclaimed,

<p/>So good,'' replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that your worship has only to spur Rocinante and get out into the open field to see the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, who, with two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see your worship.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What could I get by deceiving your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``especially when it will so soon be shown whether I tell the truth or not?
<p/>Come, senor, push on, and you will see the princess our mistress coming, robed and adorned--in fact, like what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) are all one glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, all rubies, all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hair loose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind; and moreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finest sight ever you saw.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>There is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``but no matter what they come on, there they are, the finest ladies one could wish for, especially my lady the princess Dulcinea, who staggers one's senses.''

<p/>Don Quixote looked all along the road to El Toboso, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could see nobody except the three peasant girls, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was completely puzzled, and asked Sancho if it was outside the city he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had left them.

<p/>I am Sancho Panza, his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) squire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) the vagabond knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called `The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.'
<p/>Don Quixote had by this time placed himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knees beside Sancho, and, with eyes starting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head and a puzzled gaze, was regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) whom Sancho called queen and lady; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could see nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) except a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one, for she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was platter-faced and snub-nosed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was perplexed and bewildered, and did not venture to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lips.
<p/>The country girls, at the same time, were astonished to see these two men, so different in appearance, on their knees, preventing their companion from going on.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), however, who had been stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and testily, ``Get out of the way, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for we are in a hurry.
<p/>To which Sancho returned, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, princess and universal lady of El Toboso, is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and prop of knight-errantry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees before your sublimated presence?''

<p/>why, I'm rubbing thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! Go your own way, and let us go ours, and it will be better for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote at this; <div class="bookquote">``I see that fortune, `with evil done to me unsated still,' has taken possession of all the roads by which any comfort may reach `this wretched soul' that I carry in my flesh.

<p/>Sancho stood aside and let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) go, very well pleased to have got so well out of the hobble he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was in.
<p/>The instant the village lass who had done duty for Dulcinea found herself free, prodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``cackney''  (<font color='red'><b>lady Dulcinea/Dulcinea/lady Dulcinea del Toboso</b></font>)</div>with a spike she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) had at the end of a stick, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) set off at full speed across the field.
<p/>The she-ass, however, feeling the point more acutely than usual, began cutting such capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea to the ground; seeing which, Don Quixote ran to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) up, and Sancho to fix and girth the pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the ass's belly.
<p/>The pack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about to lift up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enchanted mistress in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arms and put her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) beast, the lady, getting up from the ground, saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the trouble, for, going back a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) took a short run, and putting both hands on the croup of the ass she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon, and sat astride like a man, whereat
<p/>but our lady is lighter than a lanner, and might teach the cleverest Cordovan or Mexican how to mount; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cleared the back of the saddle in one jump, and without spurs she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is making the hackney go like a zebra; and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) damsels are no way behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), for they all fly like the wind;'' which was the truth, for as soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they pushed on after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), and sped away without looking back, for more than half a league.
<p/>Don Quixote followed them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes, and when they were no longer in sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) turned to Sancho and said, <div class="bookquote">``How now, Sancho?
<p/>And see to what a length the malice and spite they bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the happiness it would give me to see my lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own proper form.
<p/>The fact is I was born to be an example of misfortune, and the target and mark at which the arrows of adversity are aimed and directed.
<p/>Observe too, Sancho, that these traitors were not content with changing and transforming my Dulcinea, but they transformed and changed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) into a shape as mean and ill-favoured as that of the village girl yonder; and at the same time they robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of that which is such a peculiar property of ladies of distinction, that is to say, the sweet fragrance that comes of being always among perfumes and flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``the enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), whether they see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``and that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own course; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is the best physician for these and greater ailments.
<p/>Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who led the mules and acted as carter was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky, without a tilt or cane roof, and the first figure that presented itself to Don Quixote's eyes was that of Death itself with a human face; next to it was an angel with large painted wings, and at one side an emperor, with a crown, to all appearance of gold, on his (<font color='blue'><b>emperor</b></font>) head.
<p/>At the feet of Death was the god called Cupid, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) bandage, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) bow, quiver, and arrows; there was also a knight in full armour, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had no morion or helmet, but only a hat decked with plumes of divers colours; and along with these there were others with a variety of costumes and faces.
<p/>All this, unexpectedly encountered, took Don Quixote somewhat aback, and struck terror into the heart of Sancho; but the next instant Don Quixote was glad of it, believing that some new perilous adventure was presenting itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and under this impression, and with a spirit prepared to face any danger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) planted himself in front of the cart, and in a loud and menacing tone, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Carter, or coachman, or devil, or whatever thou art, tell me at once who thou art, whither thou art going, and who these folk are thou carriest in thy wagon, which looks more like Charon's boat than an ordinary cart.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>)? '' '' ''
<p/>To which the devil, stopping the cart, answered quietly, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, we are players of Angulo el Malo's company; we have been acting the play of `The Cortes of Death' this morning, which is the octave of Corpus Christi, in a village behind that hill, and we have to act it this afternoon in that village which you can see from this; and as it is so near, and to save the trouble of undressing and dressing again, we go in the costumes in which we perform.
<p/>That lad there appears as Death, that other as an angel, that woman, the manager's wife, plays the queen, this one the soldier, that the emperor, and I the devil; and I am one of the principal characters of the play, for in this company
<p/>If you want to know anything more about us, ask me and I will answer with the utmost exactitude, for as I am a devil I am up to everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div><p/>By the faith of a knight-errant,'' replied Don Quixote, ``when I saw this cart I fancied some great adventure was presenting itself to me; but I declare one must touch with the hand what appears to the eye, if illusions are to be avoided.
<p/>God speed you, good people; keep your festival, and remember, if you demand of me ought wherein I can render you a service, I will do it gladly and willingly, for from a child I was fond of the play, and in my youth a keen lover of the actor's art.
<p/>While they were talking, fate so willed it that one of the company in a mummers' dress with a great number of bells, and armed with three blown ox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and this merry-andrew approaching Don Quixote, began flourishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stick and banging the ground with the bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of the bells, which untoward apparition so startled Rocinante that, in spite of Don Quixote's efforts to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in, taking the bit between his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) teeth he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) set off across the plain with greater speed than
<p/>Sancho, who thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was in danger of being thrown, jumped off Dapple, and ran in all haste to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was already on the ground, and beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was Rocinante, who had come down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, the usual end and upshot of Rocinante's vivacity and high spirits.
<p/>But the moment Sancho quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beast to go and help Don Quixote, the dancing devil with the bladders jumped up on Dapple, and beating him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with them, more by the fright and the noise than by the pain of the blows, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fly across the fields towards the village where they were going to hold their festival.
<p/>Sancho witnessed Dapple's career and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's fall, and did not know which of the two cases of need he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should attend to first; but in the end, like a good squire and good servant, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) love for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master prevail over his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ass; though every time he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) saw the bladders rise in the air and come down on the hind quarters of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) Dapple he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) felt the pains and terrors of death, and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would have rather had the blows fall on the apples of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) own eyes than on the least hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) ass's tail.
<p/>In this trouble and perplexity he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) came to where Don Quixote lay in a far sorrier plight than he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) liked, and having helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to mount Rocinante, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Senor, the devil has carried off my Dapple.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think of it, your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``take my advice and never meddle with actors, for they are a favoured class; I myself have known an actor taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free; remember that, as they are merry folk who give pleasure, everyone favours and protects them, and helps and makes much of them, above all when they are those of the royal companies and under patent, all or most of whom in dress and appearance look like princes.
<p/>, the devil made off on foot to the town, and the ass came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) master. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, for all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``the player devil must not go off boasting, even if the whole human race favours him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) made for the cart, which was now very near the town, shouting out as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) went, ``Stay!
<p/>halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want to teach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of knights-errant for steeds.
<p/>So loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard and understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker's intention was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the emperor, the devil carter and the angel after him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), nor did the queen or the god
<p/>Cupid stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formed in line, prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their pebbles.
<p/>Don Quixote, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw them drawn up in such a gallant array with uplifted arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked Rocinante and began to consider in what way he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could attack them with the least danger to himself.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) halted Sancho came up, and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) disposed to attack this well-ordered squadron, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It would be the height of madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, senor, that against sops from the brook, and plenty of them, there is no defensive armour in the world, except to stow oneself away under a brass bell; and besides, one should remember that it is rashness, and not valour, for a single man to attack an army that has Death in it, and where emperors fight in person, with angels, good and bad, to help them; and if this reflection will not make you keep quiet, perhaps it will to know for certain that among all these, though they look like kings, princes, and emperors, there is not a single knight-errant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``which may and should turn me from the resolution I had already formed.
<p/>I cannot and must not draw sword, as I have many a time before told thee, against anyone who is not a dubbed knight; it is for thee, Sancho, if thou wilt, to take vengeance for the wrong done to thy Dapple; and I will help thee from here by shouts and salutary counsels.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, senor,'' replied Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for it is not the part of good Christians to revenge wrongs; and besides, I will arrange it with my ass to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) grievance to my good-will and pleasure, and that is to live in peace as long as heaven grants me life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Well,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``if that be thy determination, good Sancho, sensible Sancho, Christian Sancho, honest Sancho, let us leave these phantoms alone and turn to the pursuit of better and worthier adventures; for, from what I see of this country, we cannot fail to find plenty of marvellous ones in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) at once wheeled about, Sancho ran to take possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Dapple, Death and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) flying squadron returned to their cart and pursued their journey, and thus the dread adventure of the cart of Death ended happily, thanks to the advice Sancho gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master; who had, the following day, a fresh adventure, of no less thrilling interest than the last, with an enamoured knight-errant.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' CHAPTER XII. OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH BEFELL THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE WITH THE BOLD KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS
<p/>The night succeeding the day of the encounter with Death, Don Quixote and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire passed under some tall shady trees, and Don Quixote at Sancho's persuasion ate a little from the store carried by Dapple, and over their supper Sancho said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, ``Senor, what a fool I should have looked if I had chosen for my reward the spoils of the first adventure your worship achieved, instead of the foals of the three mares.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At the same time, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``if thou hadst let me attack them as I wanted, at the very least the emperor's gold crown and Cupid's painted wings would have fallen to thee as spoils, for I should have taken them by force and given them into thy hands.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>The sceptres and crowns of those play-actor emperors,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``were never yet pure gold, but only brass foil or tin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That is true,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for it would not be right that the accessories of the drama should be real, instead of being mere fictions and semblances, like the drama itself; towards which, Sancho-and, as a necessary consequence, towards those who represent and produce it--I would that thou wert favourably disposed, for they are all instruments of great good to the State, placing before us at every step a mirror in which we may see vividly displayed what goes on in human life; nor is there any similitude that shows us more faithfully what we are and ought to be than the play and the players.
<p/>Come, tell me, hast thou not seen a play acted in which kings, emperors, pontiffs, knights, ladies, and divers other personages were introduced?
<p/>One plays the villain, another the knave, this one the merchant, that the soldier, one the sharp-witted fool, another the foolish lover; and when the play is over, and they have put off the dresses they wore in it, all the actors become equal.
<p/>After all, 'a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing.'''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' Yes, I have seen that,'' said Sancho.
<p/>Well then,'' said Don Quixote, ``the same thing happens in the comedy and life of this world, where some play emperors, others popes, and, in short, all the characters that can be brought into a play; but when it is over, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all of the garments that distinguish one from the other, and all are equal in the grave.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fine comparison!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``though not so new but that I have heard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of the game of chess; how, so long as the game lasts, each piece has its own particular office, and when the game is finished they are all mixed, jumbled up and shaken together, and stowed away in the bag, which is much like ending life in the grave.
<p/>Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``it must be that some of your worship's shrewdness sticks to me; land that, of itself, is barren and dry, will come to yield good fruit if you dung it and till it; what I mean is that your worship's conversation has been the dung that has fallen on the barren soil of my dry wit, and the time I have been in your service and society has been the tillage; and with the help of this I hope to yield fruit in abundance that will not fall away or slide from those paths of good breeding that your worship has made in my parched understanding.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote. '' '' Don Quixote laughed at Sancho's affected phraseology, and perceived that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said about his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) improvement was true, for now
<p/>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spoke in a way that surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); though always, or mostly, when Sancho tried to talk fine and attempted polite language, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wound up by toppling over from the summit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) simplicity into the abyss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ignorance; and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) culture and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) memory to the greatest advantage was in dragging in proverbs, no matter whether they had any bearing or not upon the subject in hand, as may have been seen already and will be noticed in the course of this history.
<p/>In conversation of this kind they passed a good part of the night, but Sancho felt a desire to let down the curtains of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) used to say when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wanted to go to sleep; and stripping Dapple he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) at liberty to graze his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not remove Rocinante's saddle, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's express orders were, that so long as they were in the field or not sleeping under a roof Rocinante was not to be stripped--the ancient usage established and observed by knights-errant being to take off the bridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddle from the horse--never!
<p/>Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the same liberty he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had given Dapple, between whom and Rocinante there was a friendship so unequalled and so strong, that it is handed down by tradition from father to son, that the author of this veracious history devoted some special chapters to it, which, in order to preserve the propriety and decorum due to a history so heroic, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) did not insert therein; although at times he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) forgets this resolution of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) and describes how eagerly the two beasts would scratch one another when they were together and how, when they were tired or full, Rocinante would lay his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) neck across Dapple's, stretching half a yard or more on the other side, and the pair would stand thus, gazing thoughtfully on the ground, for three days, or at least so long as they were left alone, or hunger did not drive them to go and look for food.
<p/>I may add that they say the author left it on record that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) likened their friendship to that of Nisus and Euryalus, and Pylades and Orestes; and if that be so, it may be perceived, to the admiration of mankind, how firm the friendship must have been between these two peaceful animals, shaming men, who preserve friendships with one another so badly.
<p/>This was why it was said-- For friend no longer is there friend; The reeds turn lances now. And some one else has sung-- Friend to friend the bug, etc..
<p/>And let no one fancy that the author was at all astray when he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) compared the friendship of these animals to that of men; for men have received many lessons from beasts, and learned many important things, as, for example, the clyster from the stork, vomit and gratitude from the dog, watchfulness from the crane, foresight from the ant, modesty from the elephant, and loyalty from the horse.
<p/>Sancho at last fell asleep at the foot of a cork tree, while Don Quixote dozed at that of a sturdy oak; but a short time only had elapsed when a noise he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) awoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and rising up startled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) listened and looked in the direction the noise came from, and perceived two men on horseback, one of whom, letting himself drop from the saddle, said to the other,
<p/>``Dismount, my friend, and take the bridles off the horses, for, so far as I can see, this place will furnish grass for them, and the solitude and silence my love-sick thoughts need of.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said this he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stretched himself upon the ground, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) flung himself down, the armour in which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was clad rattled, whereby Don Quixote perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must be a knight-errant; and going over to Sancho, who was asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) by the arm and with no small difficulty brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) senses, and said in a low voice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Brother Sancho, we have got an adventure.

<p/>Sancho was about to reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, but the Knight of the Grove's voice, which was neither very bad nor very good, stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), and listening attentively the pair heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) sing this SONNET

<p/>The doleful knight took Don Quixote by the arm, saying, ``Sit down here, sir knight; for, that you are one, and of those that profess knight-errantry, it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you in this place, where solitude and night, the natural couch and proper retreat of knights-errant, keep you company.

<p/>I never yet saw a squire,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) of the Grove, ``who ventured to speak when his (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) master was speaking; at least, there is mine, who is as big as his (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) father, and it cannot be proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) has ever opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) lips when I am speaking.

<p/>The knights and the squires made two parties, these telling the story of their lives, the others the story of their loves; but the history relates first of all the conversation of the servants, and afterwards takes up that of the masters; and it says that, withdrawing a little from the others, he (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) of the Grove said to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``A hard life it is we lead and live, senor, we that are squires to knights-errant; verily, we eat our bread in the sweat of our faces, which is one of the curses God laid on our first parents.''

<p/>Even so it would not be so bad if we had something to eat, for woes are lighter if there's bread; but sometimes we go a day or two without breaking our fast, except with the wind that blows.
<p/>All that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of the Grove, ``may be endured and put up with when we have hopes of reward; for, unless the knight-errant he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) serves is excessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at least find himself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some fair county.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>), however, would not be anything but an emperor; but I was trembling all the time lest he (<font color='blue'><b>archbishop</b></font>) should take a fancy to go into the Church, not finding myself fit to hold office in it; for I may tell you, though I seem a man, I am no better than a beast for the Church.''

<p/>Far better would it be for us who have adopted this accursed service to go back to our own houses, and there employ ourselves in pleasanter occupations--in hunting or fishing, for instance; for what squire in the world is there so poor as not to have a hack and a couple of greyhounds and a fishingrod to amuse himself with in his (<font color='blue'><b>wight</b></font>) own village?''

<p/>Disown sons and daughters, senor, who don't do what deserves that compliments of this sort should be paid to their parents.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do disown them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, ``and in this way, and by the same reasoning, you might call me and my children and my wife all the strumpets in the world, for all they do and say is of a kind that in the highest degree deserves the same praise; and to see them again I pray God to deliver me from mortal sin, or, what comes to the same thing, to deliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which I have fallen a second time, decayed and beguiled by a purse with a hundred ducats that I found one day in the heart of the Sierra Morena; and the devil is always putting a bag full of doubloons before my eyes, here, there, everywhere, until I fancy at every stop I am putting my hand on it, and hugging it, and carrying it home with me, and making investments, and getting interest, and living like a prince; and so long as I think of this I make light of all the hardships I endure with this simpleton of a master of mine, who, I well know, is more of a madman than a knight.

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) came back the next minute with a large bota of wine and a pasty half a yard across; and this is no exaggeration, for it was made of a house rabbit so big that Sancho, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) handled it, took it to be made of a goat, not to say a kid, and looking at it he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``And do you carry this with you, senor?''

<p/>and I can tell positively its country, its kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo, and everything that appertains to a wine?
<p/>But it is no wonder, for I have had in my family, on my father's side, the two best wine-tasters that have been known in La Mancha for many a long year, and to prove it I'll tell you now a thing that happened them.
<p/>They gave the two of them some wine out of a cask, to try, asking their opinion as to the condition, quality, goodness or badness of the wine.
<p/>One of them tried it with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tongue, the other did no more than bring it to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nose.
<p/>I'll hit upon the place it came from somehow. The first said the wine had a flavour of iron, the second said it had a stronger flavour of cordovan.
<p/>The owner said the cask was clean, and that nothing had been added to the wine from which it could have got a flavour of either iron or leather.
<p/>Time went by, the wine was sold, and when they came to clean out the cask, they found in it a small key hanging to a thong of cordovan; see now if one who comes of the same stock has not a right to give his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) opinion in such like cases.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Therefore, I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) of the Grove, <div class="bookquote">``let us give up going in quest of adventures, and as we have loaves let us not go looking for cakes, but return to our cribs, for God will find us there if it be his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grove/Knight of the Grove</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless, these two great wine-tasters held to what they had said. '' <div class="bookquote">``Until my master reaches Saragossa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``I'll remain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) service; after that we'll see.
<p/>The end of it was that the two squires talked so much and drank so much that sleep had to tie their tongues and moderate their thirst, for to quench it was impossible; and so the pair of them fell asleep clinging to the now nearly empty bota and with half-chewed morsels in their mouths; and there we will leave them for the present, to relate what passed between the Knight of the Grove and him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) of the Rueful Countenance.
<p/>Among the things that passed between Don Quixote and the Knight of the Wood, the history tells us he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) of the Grove said to Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``In fine, sir knight, I would have you know that my destiny, or, more properly speaking, my choice led me to fall in love with the peerless Casildea de Vandalia.
<p/>I call her (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) peerless because she (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has no peer, whether it be in bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty.
<p/>This same Casildea, then, that I speak of, requited my honourable passion and gentle aspirations by compelling me, as his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) stepmother did Hercules, to engage in many perils of various sorts, at the end of each promising me that, with the end of the next, the object of my hopes should be attained; but my labours have gone on increasing link by link until they are past counting, nor do I know what will be the last one that is to be the beginning of the accomplishment of my chaste desires.
<p/>On one occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>stepmother</b></font>) bade me go and challenge the famous giantess of Seville, La Giralda by name, who is as mighty and strong as if made of brass, and though never stirring from one spot, is the most restless and changeable woman in the world.
<p/>, I saw, I conquered, and I made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stay quiet and behave herself, for nothing but north winds blew for more than a week.
<p/>Another time I was ordered to lift those ancient stones, the mighty bulls of Guisando, an enterprise that might more fitly be entrusted to porters than to knights.
<p/>Again, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bade me fling myself into the cavern of Cabra--an unparalleled and awful peril--and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a minute account of all that is concealed in those gloomy depths.
<p/>I stopped the motion of the Giralda, I lifted the bulls of Guisando, I flung myself into the cavern and brought to light the secrets of its abyss; and my hopes are as dead as dead can be, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scorn and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) commands as lively as ever.
<p/>To be brief, last of all she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has commanded me to go through all the provinces of Spain and compel all the knights-errant wandering therein to confess that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the most valiant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of which claim I have already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and have there vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me; but what I most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combat that so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) confess that my Casildea is more beautiful than his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) Dulcinea; and in this one victory I hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world; for this Don Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and I having vanquished him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) glory, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fame, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) honour have passed and are transferred to my person; for The more the vanquished hath of fair renown, The greater glory gilds the victor's crown.

''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Calm yourself, sir knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``and give ear to what I am about to say to you.
<p/>I would have you know that this Don Quixote you speak of is the greatest friend I have in the world; so much so that I may say I regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the same light as my own person; and from the precise and clear indications you have given I cannot but think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must be the very one you have vanquished.
<p/>On the other hand, I see with my eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have been the same; unless indeed it be that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has many enemies who are enchanters, and one in particular who is always persecuting him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), some one of these may have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shape in order to allow himself to be vanquished, so as to defraud him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the fame that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exalted achievements as a knight have earned and acquired for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) throughout the known world.
<p/>And in confirmation of this, I must tell you, too, that it is but ten hours since these said enchanters his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enemies transformed the shape and person of the fair Dulcinea del Toboso into a foul and mean village lass, and in the same way they must have transformed Don Quixote; and if all this does not suffice to convince you of the truth of what I say, here is Don Quixote himself, who will maintain it by arms, on foot or on horseback or in any way you please.
<p/>And so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stood up and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword, waiting to see what the Knight of the Grove would do, who in an equally calm voice said in reply, ``Pledges don't distress a good payer; he (<font color='blue'><b>payer</b></font>) who has succeeded in vanquishing you once when transformed, Sir Don Quixote, may fairly hope to subdue you in your own proper shape; but as it is not becoming for knights to perform their feats of arms in the dark, like highwaymen and bullies, let us wait till daylight, that the sun may behold our deeds; and the conditions of our combat shall be that the vanquished shall be at the victor's disposal, to do all that he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) may enjoin, provided the injunction be such as shall be becoming a knight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am more than satisfied with these conditions and terms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; and so saying, they betook themselves to where their squires lay, and found them snoring, and in the same posture they were in when sleep fell upon them.
<p/>They roused them up, and bade them get the horses ready, as at sunrise they were to engage in a bloody and arduous single combat; at which intelligence Sancho was aghast and thunderstruck, trembling for the safety of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master because of the mighty deeds he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had heard the squire of the Grove ascribe to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but without a word the two squires went in quest of their cattle; for by this time the three horses and the ass had smelt one another out, and were all together.
<p/>On the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of the Grove said to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``You must know, brother, that it is the custom with the fighting men of Andalusia, when they are godfathers in any quarrel, not to stand idle with folded arms while their godsons fight; I say so to remind you that while our masters are fighting, we, too, have to fight, and knock one another to shivers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>That custom, sir squire,'' replied Sancho, ``may hold good among those bullies and fighting men you talk of, but certainly not among the squires of knights-errant; at least, I have never heard my master speak of any custom of the sort, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knows all the laws of knight-errantry by heart; but granting it true that there is an express law that squires are to fight while their masters are fighting, I don't mean to obey it, but to pay the penalty that may be laid on peacefully minded squires like myself; for I am sure it cannot be more than two pounds of wax, and I would rather pay that, for I know it will cost me less than the lint I shall be at the expense of to mend my head, which I look upon as broken and split already
<p/>; there's another thing that makes it impossible for me to fight, that I have no sword, for I never carried one in my life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know a good remedy for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) of the Grove; <div class="bookquote">``I have here two linen bags of the same size; you shall take one, and I the other, and we will fight at bag blows with equal arms.
<p/>If that's the way, so be it with all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for that sort of battle will serve to knock the dust out of us instead of hurting us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will not do,''  (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div>said the other, ``for we must put into the bags, to keep the wind from blowing them away, half a dozen nice smooth pebbles, all of the same weight; and in this way we shall be able to baste one another without doing ourselves any harm or mischief.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Body of my father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``see what marten and sable, and pads of carded cotton he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is putting into the bags, that our heads may not be broken and our bones beaten to jelly!
<p/>But even if they are filled with toss silk, I can tell you, senor, I am not going to fight; let our masters fight, that's their lookout, and let us drink and live; for time will take care to ease us of our lives, without our going to look for fillips so that they may be finished off before their proper time comes
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' '' and they drop from ripeness. '' <div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>returned he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) of the Grove, <div class="bookquote">``we must fight, if it be only for half an hour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By no means,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I am not going to be so discourteous or so ungrateful as to have any quarrel, be it ever so small, with one I have eaten and drunk with; besides, who the devil could bring himself to fight in cold blood, without anger or provocation?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can remedy that entirely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) of the Grove, <div class="bookquote">``and in this way: before we begin the battle, I will come up to your worship fair and softly, and give you three or four buffets, with which I shall stretch you at my feet and rouse your anger, though it were sleeping sounder than a dormouse.
<p/>To match that plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I have another that is not a whit behind it; I will take a cudgel, and before your worship comes near enough to waken my anger I will send yours so sound to sleep with whacks, that it won't waken unless it be in the other world, where it is known that I am not a man to let my face be handled by anyone; let each look out for the arrow--though the surer way would be to let everyone's anger sleep, for nobody knows the heart of anyone, and a man may come for wool and go back shorn; God gave his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) blessing to peace and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) curse to quarrels; if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed, turns into a lion, God knows what I, who am a man, may turn into; and so from this time forth I warn you, sir squire, that all the harm and mischief that may come of our quarrel will be put down to your account.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) of the Grove; ``God will send the dawn and we shall be all right.
<p/>And now gay-plumaged birds of all sorts began to warble in the trees, and with their varied and gladsome notes seemed to welcome and salute the fresh morn that was beginning to show the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) countenance at the gates and balconies of the east, shaking from her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) locks a profusion of liquid pearls; in which dulcet moisture bathed, the plants, too, seemed to shed and shower down a pearly spray, the willows distilled sweet manna, the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, the woods rejoiced, and the meadows arrayed themselves in all their glory at her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) coming.
<p/>But hardly had the light of day made it possible to see and distinguish things, when the first object that presented itself to the eyes of Sancho Panza was the squire of the Grove's nose, which was so big that it almost overshadowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) whole body.
<p/>It is, in fact, stated, that it was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered with warts, and of a mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung down two fingers' length below his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) mouth, and the size, the colour, the warts, and the bend of it, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) face so hideous, that Sancho, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), began to tremble hand and foot like a child in convulsions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) vowed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart to let himself be given two hundred buffets, sooner than be provoked to fight that monster.
<p/>Don Quixote examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) adversary, and found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) already had his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) helmet on and visor lowered, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not see his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) observed, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was a sturdily built man, but not very tall in stature.
<p/>Over his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wore a surcoat or cassock of what seemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering mirrors like little moons, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) an extremely gallant and splendid appearance; above his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) helmet fluttered a great quantity of plumes, green, yellow, and white, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance, which was leaning against a tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palm in length.
<p/>Don Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw and observed he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) concluded that the said knight must be a man of great strength, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not for all that give way to fear, like Sancho Panza; on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) said to the Knight of the Mirrors, <div class="bookquote">``If, sir knight, your great eagerness to fight has not banished your courtesy, by it
<p/>I would entreat you to raise your visor a little, in order that I may see if the comeliness of your countenance corresponds with that of your equipment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Knight</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sir knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of the Mirrors, <div class="bookquote">``you will have more than enough time and leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with your request, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to the fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise my visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware I maintain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well then,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``while we are mounting you can at least tell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you vanquished.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To that we answer you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Mirrors, <div class="bookquote">``that you are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether you are the said person or not.
<p/>That,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``is enough to convince me that you are under a deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor, if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you take me to be.
<p/>With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote wheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) adversary, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Mirrors did the same; but Don Quixote had not moved away twenty paces when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard himself called by the other, and, each returning half-way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Mirrors said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Remember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the vanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor's disposal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am aware of it already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``provided what is commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not transgress the limits of chivalry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment the extraordinary nose of the squire presented itself to Don Quixote's view, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was no less amazed than Sancho at the sight; insomuch that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) down as a monster of some kind, or a human being of some new species or unearthly breed.
<p/>Sancho, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master retiring to run his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) course, did not like to be left alone with the nosy man, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own the battle would be all over for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would be left stretched on the ground, either by the blow or with fright; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ran after his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, holding on to Rocinante's stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) time to turn about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I implore of your worship, senor, before you turn to charge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which I will be able to witness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with this knight, more to my taste and better than from the ground.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me rather, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that thou wouldst mount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger.
<p/>To tell the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``the monstrous nose of that squire has filled me with fear and terror, and I dare not stay near him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``such a one that were I not what I am it would terrify me too; so, come, I will help thee up where thou wilt.
<p/>While Don Quixote waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Mirrors took as much ground as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) considered requisite, and, supposing Don Quixote to have done the same, without waiting for any sound of trumpet or other signal to direct them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse, which was not more agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) top speed, which was an easy trot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) proceeded to charge his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enemy; seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), however, engaged in putting Sancho up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) drew rein, and halted in mid career, for which his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) horse was very grateful, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was already unable to go.
<p/>Don Quixote, fancying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) foe was coming down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) flying, drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spurs vigorously into Rocinante's lean flanks and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) scud along in such style that the history tells us that on this occasion only was he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) known to make something like running, for on all others
<p/>it was a simple trot with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); and with this unparalleled fury he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bore down where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Mirrors stood digging his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spurs into his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse up to buttons, without being able to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stir a finger's length from the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had come to a standstill in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) course.
<p/>At this lucky moment and crisis, Don Quixote came upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) adversary, in trouble with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse, and embarrassed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) either could not manage, or had no time to lay in rest.
<p/>Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to these difficulties, and in perfect safety to himself and without any risk encountered him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Mirrors with such force that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to the ground in spite of himself over the haunches of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse, and with so heavy a fall that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand or foot.
<p/>The instant Sancho saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fall he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) slid down from the cork tree, and made all haste to where his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was, who, dismounting from Rocinante, went and stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of the Mirrors, and unlacing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) helmet to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was dead, and to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) air if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should happen to be alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw--who can say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw, without filling all who hear it with astonishment, wonder, and awe?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw, the history says, the very countenance, the very face, the very look, the very physiognomy, the very effigy, the very image of the bachelor Samson Carrasco!
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) saw it he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) called out in a loud voice, ``Make haste here, Sancho, and behold what thou art to see but not to believe; quick, my son, and learn what magic can do, and wizards and enchanters are capable of.
<p/>Sancho came up, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw the countenance of the bachelor Carrasco, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) fell to crossing himself a thousand times, and blessing himself as many more.
<p/>All this time the prostrate knight showed no signs of life, and Sancho said to Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``It is my opinion, senor, that in any case your worship should take and thrust your sword into the mouth of this one here that looks like the bachelor Samson Carrasco; perhaps in him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) you will kill one of your enemies, the enchanters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thy advice is not bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for of enemies the fewer the better;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword to carry into effect Sancho's counsel and suggestion, when the squire of the Mirrors came up, now without the nose which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) so hideous, and cried out in a loud voice,
<p/>``Mind what you are about, Senor Don Quixote; that is your friend, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, you have at your feet, and I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) squire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the nose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) without the hideous feature he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had before; to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I have it here in my pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) right pocket
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pulled out a masquerade nose of varnished pasteboard of the make already described; and Sancho, examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of amazement, <div class="bookquote">``Holy Mary be good to me!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``That is understood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of the Mirrors. '' '' '' '' '' Isn't it Tom Cecial, my neighbour and gossip?''
<p/>'' returned the now unnosed squire; ``Tom Cecial I am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I'll tell you presently the means and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat, wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) has at his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) feet; because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor Samson Carrasco, our fellow townsman.
<p/>At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote perceiving it, held the naked point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword over his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``You are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty; and in addition to this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter and fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourself before her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) on my behalf, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) deal with you according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) good pleasure; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner to return and seek me out -LRB-for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a guide to lead you to where I may be-RRB-, and tell me what may have passed between you and her-conditions which, in accordance with what we stipulated before our combat, do not transgress the just limits of knight-errantry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure I am! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>the knight</b></font>)</div>said the fallen knight, <div class="bookquote">``that the dirty tattered shoe of the lady
<p/>Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the ill-combed though clean beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to return from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) presence to yours, and to give you a full and particular account of all you demand of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the knight</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must also confess and believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>added Don Quixote, ``that the knight you vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixote of La Mancha, but some one else in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) likeness, just as I confess and believe that you, though you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not so, but some other resembling him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>), whom my enemies have here put before me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) shape, in order that I may restrain and moderate the vehemence of my wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess, hold, and think everything to be as you believe, hold, and think it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the knight</b></font>)</div>the crippled knight; ``let me rise
<p/>, I entreat you; if, indeed, the shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a sorry plight enough.
<p/>Don Quixote helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to rise, with the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire Tom Cecial; from whom Sancho never took his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes, and to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) put questions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was really and truly the Tom Cecial he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecial</b></font>) said; but the impression made on Sancho's mind by what his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master said about the enchanters having changed the face of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the bachelor Samson Carrasco, would not permit him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) to believe what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) saw with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>In fine, both master and man remained under the delusion; and, down in the mouth, and out of luck, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) of the Mirrors and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) squire parted from Don Quixote and Sancho, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) meaning to go look for some village where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could plaster and strap his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ribs.
<p/>Don Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to Saragossa, and on it the history leaves them in order that it may tell who the Knight of the Mirrors and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) long-nosed squire were.
<p/>WERE Don Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highest degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fancied him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) expected to learn whether the enchantment of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lady still continued; inasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of ceasing to be one, to return and render him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) an account of what took place between him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>But Don Quixote was of one mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the Mirrors of another, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) just then had no thought of anything but finding some village where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could plaster himself, as has been said already.
<p/>The history goes on to say, then, that when the bachelor Samson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knight-errantry which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had laid aside, it was in consequence of having been previously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means to be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet without worrying himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ill-starred adventures; at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on the special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go, as it seemed impossible to restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and that Samson should sally forth to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) as a knight-errant, and do battle with him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>), for there would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>), that being looked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and settled that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor.
<p/>Then, Don Quixote being vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) village and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) house, and not quit it for two years, or until he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) received further orders from him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); all which it was clear
<p/>Don Quixote would unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or fail to observe the laws of chivalry; and during the period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seclusion he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might perhaps forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) folly, or there might be an opportunity of discovering some ready remedy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) madness.
<p/>Carrasco undertook the task, and Tom Cecial, a gossip and neighbour of Sancho Panza's, a lively, feather-headed fellow, offered himself as his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) squire.
<p/>Carrasco armed himself in the fashion described, and Tom Cecial, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecial</b></font>) might not be known by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecial</b></font>) gossip when they met, fitted on over his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecial</b></font>) own natural nose the false masquerade one that has been mentioned; and so they followed the same route Don Quixote took, and almost came up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in time to be present at the adventure of the cart of Death and finally encountered them in the grove, where all that the sagacious reader has been reading about took place; and had it not been for the extraordinary fancies of Don Quixote, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) conviction that the bachelor was not the bachelor, senor bachelor would have been incapacitated for ever from taking his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) degree of licentiate, all through not finding nests where he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) thought to find birds.
<p/>Tom Cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry end their expedition had come to, said to the bachelor, <div class="bookquote">``Sure enough, Senor Samson Carrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan and set about an enterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to come well out of it.

 (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><p/>In that case,'' said Tom Cecial, <div class="bookquote">``I was a madman of my own accord when I volunteered to become your squire, and, of my own accord, I'll leave off being one and go home.

''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Cecial</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>That's your affair,'' returned Samson, ``but to suppose that I am going home until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing is absurd; and it is not any wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) may recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) senses that will make me hunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) out now, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with my ribs won't let me entertain more charitable thoughts.
<p/>Thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where it was their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the unfortunate Samson was cured.
<p/>Tom Cecial left him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecial</b></font>) and went home, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecial</b></font>) stayed behind meditating vengeance; and the history will return to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cecial</b></font>) again at the proper time, so as not to omit making merry with Don Quixote now.
<p/>pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, and self-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorous knight-errant of the age in the world because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) late victory.
<p/>All the adventures that could befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) from that time forth he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) regarded as already done and brought to a happy issue; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made light of enchantments and enchanters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought no more of the countless drubbings that had been administered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knight-errantry, nor of the volley of stones that had levelled half his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) teeth, nor of the ingratitude of the galley slaves, nor of the audacity of the Yanguesans and the shower of stakes that fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); in short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to himself that could he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) discover any means, mode, or way of disenchanting his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not envy the highest fortune that the most fortunate knight-errant of yore ever reached or could reach.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was going along entirely absorbed in these fancies, when Sancho said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it odd, senor, that I have still before my eyes that monstrous enormous nose of my gossip, Tom Cecial?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``a scheme and plot of the malignant magicians that persecute me, who, foreseeing that I was to be victorious in the conflict, arranged that the vanquished knight should display the countenance of my friend the bachelor, in order that the friendship I bear him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) should interpose to stay the edge of my sword and might of my arm, and temper the just wrath of my heart; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) who sought to take my life by fraud and falsehood should save his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) own.
<p/>And to prove it, thou knowest already, Sancho, by experience which cannot lie or deceive, how easy it is for enchanters to change one countenance into another, turning fair into foul, and foul into fair; for it is not two days since thou sawest with thine own eyes the beauty and elegance of the peerless Dulcinea in all its perfection and natural harmony, while I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) in the repulsive and mean form of a coarse country wench, with cataracts in her (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) eyes and a foul smell in her (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) mouth; and
<p/>when the perverse enchanter ventured to effect so wicked a transformation, it is no wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) effected that of Samson Carrasco and thy gossip in order to snatch the glory of victory out of my grasp.
<p/>For all that, however, I console myself, because, after all, in whatever shape he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) may have been, I have victorious over my enemy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows what's the truth of it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; and knowing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did that the transformation of Dulcinea had been a device and imposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's illusions were not satisfactory to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not like to reply lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should say something that might disclose his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) trickery.
<p/>As they were engaged in this conversation they were overtaken by a man who was following the same road behind them, mounted on a very handsome flea-bitten mare, and dressed in a gaban of fine green cloth, with tawny velvet facings, and a montera of the same velvet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried a Moorish cutlass hanging from a broad green and gold baldric; the buskins were of the same make as the baldric; the spurs were not gilt, but lacquered green, and so brightly polished that, matching as they did the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) apparel, they looked better than if they had been of pure gold.
<p/>When the traveller came up with them he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) saluted them courteously, and spurring his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) mare was passing them without stopping, but Don Quixote called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Gallant sir, if so be your worship is going our road, and has no occasion for speed, it would be a pleasure to me if we were to join company.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) on the mare, ``I would not pass you so hastily but for fear that horse might turn restive in the company of my mare.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may safely hold in your mare, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho in reply to this, ``for our horse is the most virtuous and well-behaved horse in the world; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) never does anything wrong on such occasions, and the only time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) misbehaved, my master and I suffered for it sevenfold; I say again your worship may pull up if you like; for if she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) between two plates the horse would not hanker after her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>).
<p/>The traveller drew rein, amazed at the trim and features of Don Quixote, who rode without his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) helmet, which Sancho carried like a valise in front of Dapple's pack-saddle; and if the man in green examined Don Quixote closely, still more closely did Don Quixote examine the man in green, who struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as being a man of intelligence.
<p/>In appearance he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was about fifty years of age, with but few grey hairs, an aquiline cast of features, and an expression between grave and gay; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) dress and accoutrements showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to be a man of good condition.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in green thought of Don Quixote of La Mancha was that a man of that sort and shape he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never yet seen; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marvelled at the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lofty stature, the lankness and sallowness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) armour, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bearing and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gravity--a figure and picture such as had not been seen in those regions for many a long day.
<p/>Don Quixote saw very plainly the attention with which the traveller was regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and read his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) curiosity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) astonishment; and courteous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was and ready to please everybody, before the other could ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) any question he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) anticipated him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) by saying, <div class="bookquote">``The appearance I present to your worship being so strange and so out of the common, I should not be surprised if it filled you with wonder; but you will cease to wonder when I tell you, as I do, that I am one of those knights who, as people say, go seeking adventures.
<p/>I have left my home, I have mortgaged my estate, I have given up my comforts, and committed myself to the arms of Fortune, to bear me whithersoever she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may please.
<p/>My desire was to bring to life again knight-errantry, now dead, and for some time past, stumbling here, falling there, now coming down headlong, now raising myself up again, I have carried out a great portion of my design, succouring widows, protecting maidens, and giving aid to wives, orphans, and minors, the proper and natural duty of knights-errant; and, therefore, because of my many valiant and Christian achievements, I have been already found worthy to make my way in print to well-nigh all, or most, of the nations of the earth.
<p/>Thirty thousand volumes of my history have been printed, and it is on the high-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times, if heaven does not put a stop to it.
<p/>In short, to sum up all in a few words, or in a single one, I may tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called `The Knight of the Rueful Countenance;' for though self-praise is degrading, I must perforce sound my own sometimes, that is to say, when there is no one at hand to do it for me.
<p/>So that, gentle sir, neither this horse, nor this lance, nor this shield, nor this squire, nor all these arms put together, nor the sallowness of my countenance, nor my gaunt leanness, will henceforth astonish you, now that you know who I am and what profession I follow.
<p/>The trappings of the mare were of the field and jineta fashion, and of mulberry colour and green. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>With these words Don Quixote held his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) peace, and, from the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took to answer, the man in green seemed to be at a loss for a reply; after a long pause, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You were right when you saw curiosity in my amazement, sir knight; but you have not succeeded in removing the astonishment I feel at seeing you; for although you say, senor, that knowing who you are ought to remove it, it has not done so; on the contrary, now that I know, I am left more amazed and astonished than before.
<p/>I cannot realise the fact that there can be anyone on earth now-a-days who aids widows, or protects maidens, or defends wives, or succours orphans; nor should I believe it had I not seen it in your worship with my own eyes.
<p/>What! is it possible that there are knights-errant in the world in these days, and histories of real chivalry printed? Blessed be heaven!
<p/>for by means of this history of your noble and genuine chivalrous deeds, which you say has been printed, the countless stories of fictitious knights-errant with which the world is filled, so much to the injury of morality and the prejudice and discredit of good histories, will have been driven into oblivion.
<p/>There is a good deal to be said on that point,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``as to whether the histories of the knights-errant are fiction or not.
<p/>I doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but never mind that just now; if our journey lasts long enough, I trust in God I shall show your worship that you do wrong in going with the stream of those who regard it as a matter of certainty that they are not true.

<p/>From this last observation of Don Quixote's, the traveller began to have a suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was some crazy being, and was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to confirm it by something further; but before they could turn to any new subject Don Quixote begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself had rendered account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) station and life.
<p/>To this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the green gaban replied ``I, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, am a gentleman by birth, native of the village where, please God, we are going to dine to-day; I am more than fairly well off, and my name is Don Diego de Miranda.
<p/>I pass my life with my wife, children, and friends; my pursuits are hunting and fishing, but I keep neither hawks nor greyhounds, nothing but a tame partridge or a bold ferret or two
<p/>; I have six dozen or so of books, some in our mother tongue, some Latin, some of them history, others devotional; those of chivalry have not as yet crossed the threshold of my door; I am more given to turning over the profane than the devotional, so long as they are books of honest entertainment that charm by their style and attract and interest by the invention they display, though of these there are very few in Spain.
<p/>Sometimes I dine with my neighbours and friends, and often invite them; my entertainments are neat and well served without stint of anything.
<p/>I have no taste for tattle, nor do I allow tattling in my presence ; I pry not into my neighbours' lives, nor have I lynx-eyes for what others do.
<p/>I hear mass every day; I share my substance with the poor, making no display of good works, lest I let hypocrisy and vainglory, those enemies that subtly take possession of the most watchful heart, find an entrance into mine.
<p/>I strive to make peace between those whom I know to be at variance; I am the devoted servant of Our Lady, and my trust is ever in the infinite mercy of God our Lord.
<p/>Sancho listened with the greatest attention to the account of the gentleman's life and occupation; and thinking it a good and a holy life, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who led it ought to work miracles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) threw himself off Dapple, and running in haste seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) right stirrup and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) foot again and again with a devout heart and almost with tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me kiss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``for I think your worship is the first saint in the saddle I ever saw all the days of my life.

<p/>Sancho went back and regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pack-saddle, having extracted a laugh from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's profound melancholy, and excited fresh amazement in Don Diego.
<p/>Don Quixote then asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) how many children he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had, and observed that one of the things wherein the ancient philosophers, who were without the true knowledge of God, placed the summum bonum was in the gifts of nature, in those of fortune, in having many friends, and many and good children.
<p/>I, Senor Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>answered the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``have one son, without whom, perhaps, I should count myself happier than I am, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is a bad son, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is not so good as I could wish.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is eighteen years of age; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has been for six at Salamanca studying Latin and Greek, and when I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to turn to the study of other sciences I found him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) so wrapped up in that of poetry -LRB-if that can be called a science-RRB- that there is no getting him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to take kindly to the law, which I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to study, or to theology, the queen of them all.
<p/>I would like him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to be an honour to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) family, as we live in days when our kings liberally reward learning that is virtuous and worthy; for learning without virtue is a pearl on a dunghill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) spends the whole day in settling whether Homer expressed himself correctly or not in such and such a line of the Iliad, whether Martial was indecent or not in such and such an epigram, whether such and such lines of Virgil are to be understood in this way or in that; in short, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) talk is of the works of these poets, and those of Horace, Perseus, Juvenal, and Tibullus; for of the moderns in our own language he (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) makes no great account; but with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) seeming indifference to Spanish poetry, just now his (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) thoughts are absorbed in making a gloss on four lines that have been sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>) from Salamanca, which I suspect are for some poetical tournament.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>Seeing this the gentleman asked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``What are you about, brother? What are these kisses for?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' ''
<p/>To all this Don Quixote said in reply, <div class="bookquote">``Children, senor, are portions of their parents' bowels, and therefore, be they good or bad, are to be loved as we love the souls that give us life; it is for the parents to guide them from infancy in the ways of virtue, propriety, and worthy Christian conduct, so that when grown up they may be the staff of their parents' old age, and the glory of their posterity; and to force them to study this or that science I do not think wise, though it may be no harm to persuade them; and when there is no need to study for the sake of pane lucrando, and it is the student's good fortune that heaven has given him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) parents who provide him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) with it, it would be my advice to them to let him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) pursue whatever science they may see him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) most inclined to; and though that of poetry is less useful than pleasurable, it is not one of those that bring discredit upon the possessor.
<p/>Poetry, gentle sir, is, as I take it, like a tender young maiden of supreme beauty, to array, bedeck, and adorn whom is the task of several other maidens, who are all the rest of the sciences; and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must avail herself of the help of all, and all derive their lustre from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>But this maiden will not bear to be handled, nor dragged through the streets, nor exposed either at the corners of the market-places, or in the closets of palaces.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is the product of an Alchemy of such virtue that he (<font color='blue'><b>maidens</b></font>) who is able to practise it, will turn her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) into pure gold of inestimable worth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>maidens</b></font>) that possesses her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must keep her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) within bounds, not permitting her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to break out in ribald satires or soulless sonnets.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must on no account be offered for sale, unless, indeed, it be in heroic poems, moving tragedies, or sprightly and ingenious comedies.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must not be touched by the buffoons, nor by the ignorant vulgar, incapable of comprehending or appreciating her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hidden treasures.
<p/>And do not suppose, senor, that I apply the term vulgar here merely to plebeians and the lower orders; for everyone who is ignorant, be he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoons</b></font>) lord or prince, may and should be included among the vulgar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoons</b></font>), then, who shall embrace and cultivate poetry under the conditions I have named, shall become famous, and his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoons</b></font>) name honoured throughout all the civilised nations of the earth.
<p/>And with regard to what you say, senor, of your son having no great opinion of Spanish poetry, I am inclined to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is not quite right there, and for this reason: the great poet Homer did not write in Latin, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) was a Greek, nor did Virgil write in Greek, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) was a Latin; in short, all the ancient poets wrote in the language they imbibed with their mother's milk, and never went in quest of foreign ones to express their sublime conceptions; and that being so, the usage should in justice extend to all nations, and the German poet should not be undervalued because he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) writes in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) own language, nor the Castilian, nor even the Biscayan, for writing in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>).
<p/>But your son, senor, I suspect, is not prejudiced against Spanish poetry, but against those poets who are mere Spanish verse writers, without any knowledge of other languages or sciences to adorn and give life and vigour to their natural inspiration; and yet even in this he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) may be wrong; for, according to a true belief, a poet is born one; that is to say, the poet by nature comes forth a poet from his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) mother's womb; and following the bent that heaven has bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>), without the aid of study or art, he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) produces things that show how truly he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) spoke who said, `Est Deus in nobis,' etc..
<p/>At the same time, I say that the poet by nature who calls in art to his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) aid will be a far better poet, and will surpass him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) who tries to be one relying upon his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) knowledge of art alone.
<p/>The reason is, that art does not surpass nature, but only brings it to perfection; and thus, nature combined with art, and art with nature, will produce a perfect poet.
<p/>To bring my argument to a close, I would say then, gentle sir, let your son go on as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) star leads him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), for being so studious as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seems to be, and having already successfully surmounted the first step of the sciences, which is that of the languages, with their help he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own exertions reach the summit of polite literature, which so well becomes an independent gentleman, and adorns, honours, and distinguishes him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), as much as the mitre does the bishop, or the gown the learned counsellor.
<p/>If your son write satires reflecting on the honour of others, chide and correct him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and tear them up; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) compose discourses in which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rebukes vice in general, in the style of Horace, and with elegance like his (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>), commend him (<font color='blue'><b>Horace</b></font>); for it is legitimate for a poet to write against envy and lash the envious in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) verse, and the other vices too, provided he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) does not single out individuals; there are, however, poets who, for the sake of saying something spiteful, would run the risk of being banished to the coast of Pontus.
<p/>If the poet be pure in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) morals, he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) will be pure in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) verses too; the pen is the tongue of the mind, and as the thought engendered there, so will be the things that it writes down.
<p/>And when kings and princes observe this marvellous science of poetry in wise, virtuous, and thoughtful subjects, they honour, value, exalt them, and even crown them with the leaves of that tree which the thunderbolt strikes not, as if to show that they whose brows are honoured and adorned with such a crown are not to be assailed by anyone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) of the green gaban was filled with astonishment at Don Quixote's argument, so much so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began to abandon the notion he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had taken up about his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) being crazy.
<p/>But in the middle of the discourse, it being not very much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) taste, Sancho had turned aside out of the road to beg a little milk from some shepherds, who were milking their ewes hard by; and just as the gentleman, highly pleased, was about to renew the conversation, Don Quixote, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head, perceived a cart covered with royal flags coming along the road they were travelling; and persuaded that this must be some new adventure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) called aloud to Sancho to come and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) helmet.
<p/>Sancho, hearing himself called, quitted the shepherds, and, prodding Dapple vigorously, came up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, to whom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XVII. WHEREIN IS SHOWN THE FURTHEST AND HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE UNEXAMPLED COURAGE OF DON QUIXOTE REACHED OR COULD REACH; TOGETHER WITH THE HAPPILY ACHIEVED ADVENTURE OF THE LIONS
<p/>The history tells that when Don Quixote called out to Sancho to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) helmet, Sancho was buying some curds the shepherds agreed to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and flurried by the great haste his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was in did not know what to do with them or what to carry them in; so, not to lose them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had already paid for them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thought it best to throw them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's helmet, and acting on this bright idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went to see what his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master wanted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) approached, exclaimed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>): ``Give me that helmet, my friend, for either I know little of adventures, or what I observe yonder is one that will, and does, call upon me to arm myself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, but could perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two or three small flags, which led him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to conclude it must be carrying treasure of the King's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said so to Don Quixote.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), however, would not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), being always persuaded and convinced that all that happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must be adventures and still more adventures; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) replied to the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who is prepared has his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) battle half fought; nothing is lost by my preparing myself, for I know by experience that I have enemies, visible and invisible, and I know not when, or where, or at what moment, or in what shapes they will attack me;''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>and turning to Sancho he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) called for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) helmet; and Sancho, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had no time to take out the curds, had to give it just as it was.
<p/>Don Quixote took it, and without perceiving what was in it thrust it down in hot haste upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head; but as the curds were pressed and squeezed the whey began to run all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face and beard, whereat
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was so startled that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cried out to Sancho: ``Sancho, what's this? I think my head is softening, or my brains are melting, or I am sweating from head to foot!
<p/>If I am sweating it is not indeed from fear. I am convinced beyond a doubt that the adventure which is about to befall me is a terrible one.
<p/>Sancho held his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tongue, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a cloth, and gave thanks to God at the same time that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) master had not found out what was the matter.
<p/>Don Quixote then wiped himself, and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) helmet to see what it was that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mash inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) helmet he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) put it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) nose, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had smelt it he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exclaimed:
<p/>``By the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thou hast put here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!
<p/>To which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied, <div class="bookquote">``If they are curds let me have them, your worship, and I'll eat them; but let the devil eat them, for it must have been he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) who put them there.
<p/>Give me something to wipe myself with, if thou hast it, for this profuse sweat is blinding me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' I dare to dirty your helmet!
<p/>You have guessed the offender finely! Faith, sir, by the light God gives me, it seems I must have enchanters too,
<p/>that persecute me as a creature and limb of your worship, and they must have put that nastiness there in order to provoke your patience to anger, and make you baste my ribs as you are wont to do.
<p/>Well, this time, indeed, they have missed their aim, for I trust to my master's good sense to see that I have got no curds or milk, or anything of the sort; and that if I had it is in my stomach
<p/>All this the gentleman was observing, and with astonishment, more especially when, after having wiped himself clean, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, face, beard, and helmet, Don Quixote put it on, and settling himself firmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stirrups, easing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword in the scabbard, and grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Now, come who will, here am I, ready to try conclusions with Satan himself in person!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By this time the cart with the flags had come up, unattended by anyone except the carter on a mule, and a man sitting in front.
<p/>I would put it and not in the helmet.'' <div class="bookquote">``May be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. Don Quixote planted himself before it and said, ``Whither are you going, brothers?
<p/>To this the carter replied, <div class="bookquote">``The cart is mine; what is in it is a pair of wild caged lions, which the governor of Oran is sending to court as a present to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) Majesty; and the flags are our lord the King's, to show that what is here is his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) property.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the carter</b></font>)</div><p/>What cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags are those? '' '' And are the lions large?'' asked Don Quixote.
<p/>So large,'' replied the man who sat at the door of the cart, <div class="bookquote">``that larger, or as large, have never crossed from Africa to Spain; I am the keeper, and I have brought over others, but never any like these.
<p/>They are male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female in the one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothing to-day, so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to the place where we are to feed them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' Hereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Lion-whelps to me! to me whelps of lions, and at such a time!
<p/>Then, by God! those gentlemen who send them here shall see if I am a man to be frightened by lions.
<p/>Get down, my good fellow, and as you are the keeper open the cages, and turn me out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain I will let them know who Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in spite and in the teeth of the enchanters who send them to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>So, so,'' said the gentleman to himself at this; ``our worthy knight has shown of what sort he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is; the curds, no doubt, have softened his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) skull and brought his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) brains to a head.
<p/>At this instant Sancho came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, for God's sake do something to keep my master, Don Quixote, from tackling these lions; for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) does they'll tear us all to pieces here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your master then so mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asked the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``that you believe and are afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will engage such fierce animals?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will prevent it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman; and going over to Don Quixote, who was insisting upon the keeper's opening the cages, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``Sir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventures which encourage the hope of a successful issue, not those which entirely withhold it; for valour that trenches upon temerity savours rather of madness than of courage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you, nor do they dream of such a thing; they are going as presents to his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) Majesty, and it will not be right to stop them or delay their journey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentle sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``you go and mind your tame partridge and your bold ferret, and leave everyone to manage his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own business; this is mine, and I know whether these gentlemen the lions come to me or not;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and then turning to the keeper he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) exclaimed,
<p/>``By all that's good, sir scoundrel, if you don't open the cages this very instant, I'll pin you to the cart with this lance.
<p/>The carter, seeing the determination of this apparition in armour, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Please your worship, for charity's sake, senor, let me unyoke the mules and place myself in safety along with them before the lions are turned out; for if they kill them on me
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) is not mad,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is venturesome. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' I am ruined for life, for all I possess is this cart and mules.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O man of little faith,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``get down and unyoke; you will soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing, and that you might have spared yourself the trouble.
<p/>The carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and the keeper called out at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I call all here to witness that against my will and under compulsion I open the cages and let the lions loose, and that I warn this gentleman that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will be accountable for all the harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for my salary and dues as well.
<p/>Once more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such a mad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety before I open, for I know they will do me no harm. '' To this, Don Quixote replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was about.
<p/>Well, senor,'' answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``if you do not like to be a spectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur your flea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.
<p/>Hearing this, Sancho with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to give up an enterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful one of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had attempted in the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) life, were cakes and fancy bread.
<p/>Look ye, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``there's no enchantment here, nor anything of the sort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have seen the paw of a real lion, and judging by
<p/>The gentleman in return entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to reflect, for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was under a delusion. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' that I reckon the lion such a paw could belong to must be bigger than a mountain.''
<p/>Retire, Sancho, and leave me; and if I die here thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea--I say no more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fear at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) look bigger to thee than half the world. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>To these he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) added some further words that banished all hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) giving up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) insane project.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the green gaban would have offered resistance, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found himself ill-matched as to arms, and did not think it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such Don Quixote now showed himself to be in every respect; and the latter, renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) commands to the keeper and repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) threats, gave warning to the gentleman to spur his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mare, Sancho his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Dapple, and the carter his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mules, all striving to get away from the cart as far as they could before the lions broke loose.
<p/>Sancho was weeping over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's death, for this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) firmly believed it was in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) from the claws of the lions; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fate and called it an unlucky hour when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thought of taking service with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) again; but with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tears and lamentations he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not forget to thrash Dapple so as to put a good space between himself and the cart.
<p/>The keeper, seeing that the fugitives were now some distance off, once more entreated and warned him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) as before; but he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) need not trouble himself with any further warnings or entreaties, as they would be fruitless, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) make haste.
<p/>During the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the first cage, Don Quixote was considering whether it would not be well to do battle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fight on foot, fearing that Rocinante might take fright at the sight of the lions; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) therefore sprang off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse, flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance aside, braced his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm, and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword, advanced slowly with marvellous intrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in front of the cart, commending himself with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart to God and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea.
<p/>It is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author of this veracious history breaks out into exclamations.
<p/>'' O doughty Don Quixote! high-mettled past extolling! Mirror, wherein all the heroes of the world may see themselves! Second modern Don Manuel de Leon, once the glory and honour of Spanish knighthood!
<p/>In what words shall I describe this dread exploit, by what language shall I make it credible to ages to come, what eulogies are there unmeet for thee, though they be hyperboles piled on hyperboles!
<p/>On foot, alone, undaunted, high-souled, with but a simple sword, and that no trenchant blade of the Perrillo brand, a shield, but no bright polished steel one
<p/>Thy own deeds be thy praise, valiant Manchegan, and here I leave them as they stand, wanting the words wherewith to glorify them!''
<p/>Here the author's outburst came to an end, and he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) proceeded to take up the thread of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) story, saying that the keeper, seeing that Don Quixote had taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) position, and that it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to avoid letting out the male without incurring the enmity of the fiery and daring knight, flung open the doors of the first cage, containing, as has been said, the lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size, and grim and hideous mien.
<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did was to turn round in the cage in which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lay, and protrude his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) claws, and stretch himself thoroughly; he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) next opened his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and with near two palms' length of tongue that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had thrust forth, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) licked the dust out of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) eyes and washed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) face; having done this, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head out of the cage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals, a spectacle and demeanour to strike terror into temerity itself.
<p/>Don Quixote merely observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) steadily, longing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to leap from the cart and come to close quarters with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hoped to hew him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in pieces.
<p/>So far did his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more courteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after having looked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay down again in the cage.
<p/>Seeing this, Don Quixote ordered the keeper to take a stick to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) come out.
<p/>, there stoodst thou, biding and awaiting the two fiercest lions that Africa's forests ever bred! '' That I won't,'' said the keeper; ``for if I anger him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), the first he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>)'ll tear in pieces will be myself.
<p/>Be satisfied, sir knight, with what you have done, which leaves nothing more to be said on the score of courage, and do not seek to tempt fortune a second time.
<p/>The lion has the door open; he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is free to come out or not to come out; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) has not come out so far, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will not come out to-day.
<p/>Your worship's great courage has been fully manifested already; no brave champion, so it strikes me, is bound to do more than challenge his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) enemy and wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) on the field; if his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) adversary does not come, on him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) lies the disgrace, and he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) who waits for him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) carries off the crown of victory.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``close the door, my friend, and let me have, in the best form thou canst,
<p/>what thou hast seen me do, by way of certificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion, that I waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not come out, that I still waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and that still he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not come out, and lay down again.
<p/>Close the door as I bade thee, while I make signals to the fugitives that have left us, that they may learn this exploit from thy lips.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>I am not bound to do more; enchantments avaunt, and God uphold the right, the truth, and true chivalry! ''
<p/>The keeper obeyed, and Don Quixote, fixing on the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance the cloth he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face with after the deluge of curds, proceeded to recall the others, who still continued to fly, looking back at every step, all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear.
<p/>Sancho, however, happening to observe the signal of the white cloth, exclaimed, ``May I die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts, for he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is calling to us.
<p/>They all stopped, and perceived that it was Don Quixote who was making signals, and shaking off their fears to some extent, they approached slowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly Don Quixote's voice calling to them.
<p/>They returned at length to the cart, and as they came up, Don Quixote said to the carter, <div class="bookquote">``Put your mules to once more, brother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) two gold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delay they have incurred through me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the carter</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``That will I give with all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``but what has become of the lions? Are they dead or alive?
<p/>The keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of the contest, exalting to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) power and ability the valour of Don Quixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not and dared not come out of the cage, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had held the door open ever so long; and showing how, in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) having represented to the knight that it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order to force him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) out, which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wished to have done, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) very reluctantly, and altogether against his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will, had allowed the door to be closed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' What dost thou think of this, Sancho?'' said Don Quixote. '' Are there any enchantments that can prevail against true valour?
<p/>Sancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed Don Quixote's hands for the bounty bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and promised to give an account of the valiant exploit to the King himself, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) at court.
<p/>Then,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``if his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) Majesty should happen to ask who performed it, you must say THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS; for it is my desire that into this the name I have hitherto borne of Knight of the Rueful Countenance be from this time forward changed, altered, transformed, and turned; and in this I follow the ancient usage of knights-errant, who changed their names when they pleased, or when it suited their purpose.
<p/>The enchanters may be able to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude and courage they cannot. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken a word, being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that Don Quixote did and said, and the opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) formed was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was a man of brains gone mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality.
<p/>The first part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) history had not yet reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), for, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) read it, the amazement with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) words and deeds filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have vanished, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would then have understood the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) madness; but knowing nothing of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to be rational one moment, and crazy the next, for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said was sensible, elegant, and well expressed, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did, absurd, rash, and foolish; and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to himself, ``What could be madder than putting on a helmet full of curds, and then persuading oneself that enchanters are softening one's skull; or what could be greater rashness and folly than wanting to fight lions tooth and nail?
<p/>Don Quixote roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) from these reflections and this soliloquy by saying, <div class="bookquote">``No doubt, Senor Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down in your mind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did, for my deeds do not argue anything else.
<p/>But for all that, I would have you take notice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must have seemed to you.
<p/>A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lance to bear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sovereign, in the midst of a spacious plaza; a knight shows to advantage arrayed in glittering armour, pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyous tournament, and all those knights show to advantage that entertain, divert, and, if we may say so, honour the courts of their princes by warlike exercises, or what resemble them; but to greater advantage than all these does a knight-errant show when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) traverses deserts, solitudes, cross-roads, forests, and mountains, in quest of perilous adventures, bent on bringing them to a happy and successful issue, all to win a glorious and lasting renown.
<p/>To greater advantage, I maintain, does the knight-errant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonely waste, than the court knight dallying with some city damsel.
<p/>All knights have their own special parts to play; let the courtier devote himself to the ladies, let him (<font color='blue'><b>courtier</b></font>) add lustre to his (<font color='blue'><b>courtier</b></font>) sovereign's court by his (<font color='blue'><b>courtier</b></font>) liveries, let him (<font color='blue'><b>courtier</b></font>) entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare of his (<font color='blue'><b>courtier</b></font>) table,
<p/>let him (<font color='blue'><b>courtier</b></font>) arrange joustings, marshal tournaments, and prove himself noble, generous, and magnificent, and above all a good Christian, and so doing he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) will fulfil the duties that are especially his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>); but let the knight-errant explore the corners of the earth and penetrate the most intricate labyrinths, at each step let him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) attempt impossibilities, on desolate heaths let him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) endure the burning rays of the midsummer sun, and the bitter inclemency of the winter winds and frosts; let no lions daunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
<p/>, no monsters terrify him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), no dragons make him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) quail; for to seek these, to attack those, and to vanquish all, are in truth his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) main duties.
<p/>I, then, as it has fallen to my lot to be a member of knight-errantry, cannot avoid attempting all that to me seems to come within the sphere of my duties; thus it was my bounden duty to attack those lions that I just now attacked, although I knew it to be the height of rashness; for I know well what valour is, that it is a virtue that occupies a place between two vicious extremes, cowardice and temerity; but it will be a lesser evil for him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) who is valiant to rise till he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) reaches the point of rashness, than to sink until he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) reaches the point of cowardice; for, as it is easier for the prodigal than for the miser to become generous, so it is easier for a rash man to prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true valour; and believe me, Senor Don Diego, in attempting adventures it is better to lose by a card too many than by a card too few; for to hear it said, `such a knight is rash and daring,' sounds better than `such a knight is timid and cowardly.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I protest, Senor Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Diego/Don Diego de Miranda</b></font>)</div>said Don Diego, <div class="bookquote">``everything you have said and done is proved correct by the test of reason itself; and I believe, if the laws and ordinances of knight-errantry should be lost, they might be found in your worship's breast as in their own proper depository and muniment-house; but let us make haste, and reach my village, where you shall take rest after your late exertions; for if they have not been of the body they have been of the spirit, and these sometimes tend to produce bodily fatigue.''

<p/>The cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the green gaban went theirs. '' CHAPTER XVIII. <div class="bookquote">``O ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found!
<p/>Once sweet and welcome when 'twas heaven's good-will. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>O ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the sweet object of my bitter regrets!
<p/>The student poet, Don Diego's son, who had come out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) mother to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>), heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were filled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) presented; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), however, dismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness to ask permission to kiss the lady's hand, while Don Diego said, ``Senora, pray receive with your wonted kindness Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, whom you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in the world.
<p/>The lady, whose name was Dona Christina, received him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with every sign of good-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) service with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases.
<p/>Almost the same civilities were exchanged between him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and the student, who listening to Don Quixote, took him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to be a sensible, clear-headed person.
<p/>Here the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego's mansion, putting before us in his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) picture the whole contents of a rich gentleman-farmer's house; but the translator of the history thought it best to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence, as they are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, the strong point of which is truth rather than dull digressions.
<p/>They led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) armour, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet,
<p/>all stained with the rust of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) armour; his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) collar was a falling one of scholastic cut, without starch or lace, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) buskins buff-coloured, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shoes polished.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) good sword, which hung in a baldric of sea-wolf's skin, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had suffered for many years, they say, from an ailment of the kidneys; and over all he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) threw a long cloak of good grey cloth.
<p/>But first of all, with five or six buckets of water -LRB-for as regard the number of buckets there is some dispute-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head and face, and still the water remained whey-coloured, thanks to Sancho's greediness and purchase of those unlucky curds that turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master so white.
<p/>Thus arrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant air, Don Quixote passed out into another room, where the student was waiting to entertain him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) while the table was being laid; for on the arrival of so distinguished a guest, Dona Christina was anxious to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Christina</b></font>) knew how and was able to give a becoming reception to those who came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Christina</b></font>) house.
<p/>While Don Quixote was taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour, Don Lorenzo -LRB-for so Don Diego's son was called-RRB- took the opportunity to say to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``What are we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us, sir?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>'' For his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) appearance, and your describing him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as a knight-errant have completely puzzled my mother and me.''
<p/>Don Diego; ``all I can tell thee is that I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) act the acts of the greatest madman in the world, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) make observations so sensible that they efface and undo all he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) does; do thou talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) and feel the pulse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) wits, and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am more inclined to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) to be mad than sane.
<p/>With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been said, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, <div class="bookquote">``Your father, Senor Don Diego de Miranda, has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and, above all, that you are a great poet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to say, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied. '' '' A poet, it may be,'' replied Don Lorenzo, <div class="bookquote">``but a great one, by no means.
<p/>It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to reading good poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of `great' which my father gives me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not dislike that modesty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``for there is no poet who is not conceited and does not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is the best poet in the world.
<p/>There is no rule without an exception,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Lorenzo; <div class="bookquote">``there may be some who are poets and yet do not think they are.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very few,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``but tell me, what verses are those which you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat restless and absorbed?
<p/>If it be some gloss, I know something about glosses, and I should like to hear them; and if they are for a poetical tournament, contrive to carry off the second prize; for the first always goes by favour or personal standing, the second by simple justice; and so the third comes to be the second, and the first, reckoning in this way, will be third, in the same way as licentiate degrees are conferred at the universities; but, for all that, the title of first is a great distinction.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div>said Don Lorenzo to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I should not take you to be a madman; but let us go on.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div>'' '' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Your worship has apparently attended the schools; what sciences have you studied?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>That of knight-errantry,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``which is as good as that of poetry, and even a finger or two above it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what science that is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div>said Don Lorenzo, ``and until now I have never heard of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a science,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that comprehends in itself all or most of the sciences in the world, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who professes it must be a jurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive and equitable, so as to give to each one what belongs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and is due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must be a theologian, so as to be able to give a clear and distinctive reason for the Christian faith he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) professes, wherever it may be asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) must be a physician, and above all a herbalist, so as in wastes and solitudes to know the herbs that have the property of healing wounds, for a knight-errant must not go looking for some one to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) at every step.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) must be an astronomer, so as to know by the stars how many hours of the night have passed, and what clime and quarter of the world he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) must know mathematics, for at every turn some occasion for them will present itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>); and, putting it aside that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) must be adorned with all the virtues, cardinal and theological, to come down to minor particulars, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) must, I say, be able to swim as well as Nicholas or Nicolao
<p/>the Fish could, as the story goes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) must know how to shoe a horse, and repair his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) saddle and bridle; and, to return to higher matters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) must be faithful to God and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) lady; he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholas</b></font>) must be pure in thought, decorous in words, generous in works, valiant in deeds, patient in suffering, compassionate towards the needy, and, lastly, an upholder of the truth though its defence should cost him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) life.
<p/>Of all these qualities, great and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then, Senor Don Lorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knight who studies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not compare with the very loftiest that are taught in the schools.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' If that be so,'' replied Don Lorenzo, <div class="bookquote">``this science, I protest, surpasses all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How, if that be so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote.
<p/>What I mean to say,'' said Don Lorenzo, <div class="bookquote">``is, that I doubt whether there are now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned with such virtues.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Many a time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``have I said what I now say once more, that the majority of the world are of opinion that there never were any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that, unless heaven by some miracle brings home to them the truth that there were and are, all the pains one takes will be in vain -LRB-as experience has often proved to me-RRB-, I will not now stop to disabuse you of the error you share with the multitude.
<p/>All I shall do is to pray to heaven to deliver you from it, and show you how beneficial and necessary knights-errant were in days of yore, and how useful they would be in these days were they but in vogue; but now, for the sins of the people, sloth and indolence, gluttony and luxury are triumphant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our guest has broken out on our hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div>said Don Lorenzo to himself at this point; <div class="bookquote">``but, for all that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) is a glorious madman, and I should be a dull blockhead to doubt it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div>'' Here, being summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close. Don Diego asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) son what he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) had been able to make out as to the wits of their guest.
<p/>To which he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) replied, ``All the doctors and clever scribes in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) madness; he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) is a madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals.
<p/>They went in to dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said on the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) was in the habit of giving to his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) guests, neat, plentiful, and tasty; but what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silence that reigned throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusian monastery.
<p/>When the cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, Don Quixote earnestly pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) verses for the poetical tournament, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Not to be like those poets who, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and when they are not asked for them
<p/>, I will repeat my gloss, for which I do not expect any prize, having composed it merely as an exercise of ingenuity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A discerning friend of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``was of opinion that no one ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) gave was that the gloss can never come up to the text, and that often or most frequently it wanders away from the meaning and purpose aimed at in the glossed lines; and besides, that the laws of the gloss were too strict, as they did not allow interrogations, nor `said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>),' nor 'I say,' nor turning verbs into nouns, or altering the construction, not to speak of other restrictions and limitations that fetter gloss-writers, as you no doubt know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Verily, Senor Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div>said Don Lorenzo, <div class="bookquote">``I wish I could catch your worship tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you slip through my fingers like an eel.

<p/>O Fortune, long I've sued to thee; The gifts thou gavest me restore, For, trust me, I would ask no more, Could `was' become an `is' for me.
<p/>No other prize I seek to gain, No triumph, glory, or success, Only the long-lost happiness, The memory whereof is pain.
<p/>One taste, methinks, of bygone bliss The heart-consuming fire might stay; And, so it come without delay, Then would I ask no more than this.
<p/>That time should ever be, and then Come back to us, and be again, No power on earth can bring to pass; For fleet of foot is he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), I wis,
<p/>And idly, therefore, do we pray That what for aye hath left us may Become for us the time that is.
<p/>Perplexed, uncertain, to remain `Twixt hope and fear, is death, not life; `Twere better, sure, to end the strife, And dying, seek release from pain.
<p/>I ask what cannot be, alas! And yet, thought were the best for me. Anon the thought aside I fling, And to the present fondly cling, And dread the time that is to be.
<p/>When Don Lorenzo had finished reciting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) gloss, Don Quixote stood up, and in a loud voice, almost a shout, exclaimed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) grasped Don Lorenzo's right hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``By the highest heavens, noble youth, but you are the best poet on earth, and deserve to be crowned with laurel, not by Cyprus or by Gaeta--as a certain poet, God forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), said--but by the Academies of Athens, if they still flourished, and by those that flourish now, Paris, Bologna, Salamanca.
<p/>Heaven grant that the judges who rob you of the first prize--that Phoebus may pierce them with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arrows, and the Muses never cross the thresholds of their doors.
<p/>Repeat me some of your long-measure verses, senor, if you will be so good, for I want thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius.
<p/>Is there any need to say that Don Lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praised by Don Quixote, albeit he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as a madman?
<p/>Don Lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) complied with Don Quixote's request and entreaty, and repeated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) this sonnet on the fable or story of Pyramus and Thisbe.
<p/>The lovely maid, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) pierces now the wall; Heart-pierced by her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) young Pyramus doth lie; And Love spreads wing from Cyprus isle to fly,

<p/>So runs the strange tale, how the lovers twain One sword, one sepulchre, one memory, Slays, and entombs, and brings to life again.
<p/>Blessed be God,'' said Don Quixote when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had heard Don Lorenzo's sonnet, <div class="bookquote">``that among the hosts there are of irritable poets
<p/>For four days was Don Quixote most sumptuously entertained in Don Diego's house, at the end of which time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) permission to depart, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for the kindness and hospitality he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had received in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) house, but that, as it did not become knights-errant to give themselves up for long to idleness and luxury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was anxious to fulfill the duties of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) calling in seeking adventures, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was informed there was an abundance in that neighbourhood, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hoped to employ his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) time until the day came round for the jousts at Saragossa, for that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) proper destination; and that, first of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant to enter the cave of Montesinos, of which so many marvellous things were reported all through the country, and at the same time to investigate and explore the origin and true source of the seven lakes commonly called the lakes of Ruidera.
<p/>Don Diego and his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) son commended his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) laudable resolution, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) furnish himself with all he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) wanted from their house and belongings, as they would most gladly be of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>); which, indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) personal worth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) honourable profession made incumbent upon them.
<p/>The day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote as it was sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfied with the abundance of Don Diego's house, and objected to return to the starvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) ill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) filled and packed with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) considered needful.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Lorenzo</b></font>)</div>I have found one consummate one, which, senor, the art of this sonnet proves to me that you are!'' On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, ``I know not whether I have told you already, but
<p/>if I have I tell you once more, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reaching the inaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you have nothing to do but to turn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of poetry and take the still narrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough, however, to make you an emperor in the twinkling of an eye.
<p/>In this speech Don Quixote wound up the evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) madness, but still better in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) added when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``God knows, I would gladly take Don Lorenzo with me to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) how to spare the humble, and trample the proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of the profession I belong to; but since his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) tender age does not allow of it, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Lorenzo</b></font>) praiseworthy pursuits permit it, I will simply content myself with impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a poet if you are guided by the opinion of others rather than by your own; because no fathers or mothers ever think their own children ill-favoured, and this sort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of the children of the brain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley Don Quixote talked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the pertinacity and persistence he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) displayed in going through thick and thin in quest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) unlucky adventures, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made the end and aim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) desires.
<p/>There was a renewal of offers of service and civilities, and then, with the gracious permission of the lady of the castle, they took their departure, Don Quixote on Rocinante, and Sancho on Dapple.
<p/>OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS Don Quixote had gone but a short distance beyond Don Diego's village, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fell in with a couple of either priests or students, and a couple of peasants, mounted on four beasts of the ass kind.
<p/>One of the students carried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of a portmanteau, what seemed to be a little linen and a couple of pairs of ribbed stockings; the other carried nothing but a pair of new fencing-foils with buttons.
<p/>The peasants carried divers articles that showed they were on their way from some large town where they had bought them, and were taking them home to their village; and both students and peasants were struck with the same amazement that everybody felt who saw Don Quixote for the first time, and were dying to know who this man, so different from ordinary men, could be.
<p/>Don Quixote saluted them, and after ascertaining that their road was the same as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), made them an offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) company, and begged them to slacken their pace, as their young asses travelled faster than his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse; and then, to gratify them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) told them in a few words who he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was and the calling and profession he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) followed, which was that of a knight-errant seeking adventures in all parts of the world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) informed them that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own name was Don Quixote of La Mancha, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was called, by way of surname, the Knight of the Lions.
<p/>All this was Greek or gibberish to the peasants, but not so to the students, who very soon perceived the crack in Don Quixote's pate; for all that, however, they regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with admiration and respect, and one of them said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>),
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you, sir knight, have no fixed road, as it is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any, let your worship come with us; you will see one of the finest and richest weddings that up to this day have ever been celebrated in La Mancha, or for many a league round.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XIX. IN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD, TOGETHER WITH '' Don Quixote asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) if it was some prince's, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spoke of it in this way.
<p/>Not at all,'' said the student; <div class="bookquote">``it is the wedding of a farmer and a farmer's daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) the richest in all this country, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the fairest mortal ever set eyes on.
<p/>The display with which it is to be attended will be something rare and out of the common, for it will be celebrated in a meadow adjoining the town of the bride, who is called, par excellence, Quiteria the fair, as the bridegroom is called Camacho the rich.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) is eighteen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) twenty-two, and they are fairly matched, though some knowing ones, who have all the pedigrees in the world by heart, will have it that the family of the fair Quiteria is better than Camacho's; but no one minds that now-a-days, for wealth can solder a great many flaws.
<p/>At any rate, Camacho is free-handed, and it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) fancy to screen the whole meadow with boughs and cover it in overhead, so that the sun will have hard work if he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) tries to get in to reach the grass that covers the soil.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) has provided dancers too, not only sword but also bell-dancers, for in his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection; of shoe-dancers I say nothing, for of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) has engaged a host.
<p/>But none of these things, nor of the many others I have omitted to mention, will do more to make this a memorable wedding than the part which I suspect the despairing Basilio will play in it.
<p/>This Basilio is a youth of the same village as Quiteria, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) lived in the house next door to that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) parents, of which circumstance Love took advantage to reproduce to the word the long-forgotten loves of Pyramus and Thisbe; for Basilio loved Quiteria from his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) earliest years, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) responded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) passion with countless modest proofs of affection, so that the loves of the two children, Basilio and Quiteria, were the talk and the amusement of the town.
<p/>As they grew up, the father of Quiteria made up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind to refuse Basilio his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) wonted freedom of access to the house, and to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) arranged a match for his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) daughter with the rich Camacho, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) did not approve of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to Basilio, who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature; for if the truth be told ungrudgingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) is the most agile youth we know, a mighty thrower of the bar, a first-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; he (<font color='blue'><b>wrestler</b></font>) runs like a deer, and leaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins as if by magic, sings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it speak, and, above all, handles a sword as well as the best.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the student wedding eyes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For that excellence alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote at this, ``the youth deserves to marry, not merely the fair Quiteria, but Queen Guinevere herself, were she (<font color='blue'><b>Guinevere</b></font>) alive now, in spite of Launcelot and all who would try to prevent it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say that to my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, who had until now listened in silence, <div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) won't hear of anything but
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' each one marrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) equal, holding with the proverb `each ewe to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like.' What I would like is that this good Basilio -LRB-for I am beginning to take a fancy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) already-RRB-
<p/>should marry this lady Quiteria; and a blessing and good luck--I meant to say the opposite--on people who would prevent those who love one another from marrying.''
<p/>If all those who love one another were to marry,'' said Don Quixote, ``it would deprive parents of the right to choose, and marry their children to the proper person and at the proper time; and if it was left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be for choosing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father's servant, and another, some one she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing, though he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) may be a drunken bully; for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment, so much wanted in choosing one's way of life; and the matrimonial choice is very liable to error, and it needs great caution and the special favour of heaven to make it a good one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) who has to make a long journey, will, if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) is wise, look out for some trusty and pleasant companion to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sets out.
<p/>Why, then, should not he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) do the same who has to make the whole journey of life down to the final halting-place of death, more especially when the companion has to be his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) companion in bed, at board, and everywhere, as the wife is to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband?
<p/>The companionship of one's wife is no article of merchandise, that, after it has been bought, may be returned, or bartered, or changed; for it is an inseparable accident that lasts as long as life lasts; it is a noose that, once you put it round your neck, turns into a Gordian knot, which, if the scythe of Death does not cut it, there is no untying.
<p/>I could say a great deal more on this subject, were I not prevented by the anxiety I feel to know if the senor licentiate has anything more to tell about the story of Basilio.
<p/>To this the student, bachelor, or, as Don Quixote called him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), licentiate, replied, ``I have nothing whatever to say further, but that from the moment Basilio learned that the fair Quiteria was to be married to Camacho the rich, he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) has never been seen to smile, or heard to utter rational word, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) always goes about moody and dejected, talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) is out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) senses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) eats little and sleeps little, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) eats is fruit, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) sleeps, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) sleeps at all, it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute beast.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) gazes at the sky, at other times he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) fixes his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) eyes on the earth in such an abstracted way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) might be taken for a clothed statue, with its drapery stirred by the wind.
<p/>In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) shows such signs of a heart crushed by suffering, that all we who know him (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) believe that when to-morrow the fair Quiteria says `yes,' it will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) sentence of death.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God will guide it better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for God who gives the wound gives the salve; nobody knows what will happen; there are a good many hours between this and to-morrow, and any one of them, or any moment, the house may fall; I have seen the rain coming down and the sun shining all at one time; many a one goes to bed in good health who can't stir the next day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' And tell me, is there anyone who can boast of having driven a nail into the wheel of fortune?
<p/>No, faith; and between a woman's `yes' and `no' I wouldn't venture to put the point of a pin, for there would not be room for it; if you tell me Quiteria loves Basilio heart and soul, then I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) a bag of good luck; for love, I have heard say, looks through spectacles that make copper seem gold, poverty wealth, and bleary eyes pearls.
<p/>What art thou driving at, Sancho? curses on thee!'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``for when thou takest to stringing proverbs and sayings together, no one can understand thee but
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' Judas himself, and I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Judas</b></font>) had thee. Tell me, thou animal, what dost thou know about nails or wheels, or anything else?''
<p/>Oh, if you don't understand me,'' replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``it is no wonder my words are taken for nonsense; but no matter; I understand myself, and I know I have not said anything very foolish in what I have said; only your worship, senor, is always gravelling at everything I say, nay, everything I do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Cavilling, not gravelling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``thou prevaricator of honest language, God confound thee!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't find fault with me, your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho,
<p/>``for you know I have not been bred up at court or trained at Salamanca, to know whether I am adding or dropping a letter or so in my words.
<p/>God bless me, it's not fair to force a Sayago-man to speak like a Toledan; maybe there are Toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to polished talk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the licentiate</b></font>)</div>said the licentiate, <div class="bookquote">``for those who have been bred up in the Tanneries and the Zocodover cannot talk like those who are almost all day pacing the cathedral cloisters, and yet they are all Toledans.
<p/>Pure, correct, elegant and lucid language will be met with in men of courtly breeding and discrimination, though they may have been born in Majalahonda; I say of discrimination, because there are many who are not so, and discrimination is the grammar of good language, if it be accompanied by practice.
<p/>I, sirs, for my sins have studied canon law at Salamanca, and I rather pique myself on expressing my meaning in clear, plain, and intelligible language.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the licentiate</b></font>)</div><p/>If you did not pique yourself more on your dexterity with those foils you carry than on dexterity of tongue,'' said the other student, ``you would have been head of the degrees, where you are now tail.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, bachelor Corchuelo,''  (<font color='red'><b>the licentiate</b></font>)</div>returned the licentiate, ``you have the most mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword, if you think it useless.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no idea on my part, but an established truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Corchuelo/Lorenzo Corchuelo</b></font>)</div>replied Corchuelo; <div class="bookquote">``and if you wish me to prove it to you by experiment, you have swords there, and it is a good opportunity; I have a steady hand and a strong arm, and these joined with my resolution, which is not small, will make you confess that I am not mistaken.
<p/>Dismount and put in practice your positions and circles and angles and science, for I hope to make you see stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship, in which, next to God, I place my trust that the man is yet to be born who will make me turn my back, and that there is not one in the world I will not compel to give ground.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Corchuelo/Lorenzo Corchuelo</b></font>)</div><p/>As to whether you turn your back or not, I do not concern myself,'' replied the master of fence; <div class="bookquote">``though it might be that your grave would be dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time
<p/>Why! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' ; I mean that you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall soon see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Corchuelo/Lorenzo Corchuelo</b></font>)</div>replied Corchuelo, and getting off his (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) ass briskly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiate carried on his (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) beast.
<p/>It must not be that way,'' said Don Quixote at this point; <div class="bookquote">``I will be the director of this fencing match, and judge of this often disputed question;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and dismounting from Rocinante and grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) lance, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) planted himself in the middle of the road, just as the licentiate, with an easy, graceful bearing and step, advanced towards Corchuelo, who came on against him (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>), darting fire from his (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) eyes, as the saying is.
<p/>'' The other two of the company, the peasants, without dismounting from their asses, served as spectators of the mortal tragedy.
<p/>The cuts, thrusts, down strokes, back strokes and doubles, that Corchuelo delivered were past counting, and came thicker than hops or hail.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) attacked like an angry lion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the licentiate's sword that checked him (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) furious onset, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) kiss it as if it were a relic, though not as devoutly as relics are and ought to be kissed.
<p/>The end of it was that the licentiate reckoned up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) by thrusts every one of the buttons of the short cassock he (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) wore, tore the skirts into strips, like the tails of a cuttlefish, knocked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) hat twice, and so completely tired him (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) out, that in vexation, anger, and rage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) took the sword by the hilt and flung it away with such force, that one of the peasants that were there, who was a notary, and who went for it, made an affidavit afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) sent it nearly three-quarters of a league, which testimony will serve, and has served, to show and establish with all certainty that strength is overcome by skill.
<p/>Corchuelo sat down wearied, and Sancho approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``By my faith, senor bachelor, if your worship takes my advice, you will never challenge anyone to fence again, only to wrestle and throw the bar, for you have the youth and strength for that; but as for these fencers as they call them, I have heard say they can put the point of a sword through the eye of a needle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Corchuelo/Lorenzo Corchuelo</b></font>)</div>said Corchuelo, <div class="bookquote">``and with having had the truth I was so ignorant of proved to me by experience;''  (<font color='red'><b>Corchuelo/Lorenzo Corchuelo</b></font>)</div>and getting up he (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) embraced the licentiate, and they were better friends than ever; and not caring to wait for the notary who had gone for the sword, as they saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) would be a long time about it, they resolved to push on so as to reach the village of Quiteria, to which they all belonged, in good time.
<p/>During the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them on the excellences of the sword, with such conclusive arguments, and such figures and mathematical proofs, that all were convinced of the value of the science, and Corchuelo cured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corchuelo</b></font>) dogmatism.
<p/>It grew dark; but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as if there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it.
<p/>They heard, too, the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments, flutes, drums, psalteries, pipes, tabors, and timbrels, and as they drew near they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcade that had been constructed at the entrance of the town were filled with lights unaffected by the wind, for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees.
<p/>The musicians were the life of the wedding, wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate bands, some dancing, others singing, others playing the various instruments already mentioned.
<p/>Several other persons were engaged in erecting raised benches from which people might conveniently see the plays and dances that were to be performed the next day on the spot dedicated to the celebration of the marriage of Camacho the rich and the obsequies of Basilio.
<p/>Don Quixote would not enter the village, although the peasant as well as the bachelor pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) excused himself, however, on the grounds, amply sufficient in his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) opinion, that it was the custom of knights-errant to sleep in the fields and woods in preference to towns, even were it under gilded ceilings; and so turned aside a little out of the road, very much against Sancho's will, as the good quarters he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had enjoyed in the castle or house of Don Diego came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) mind.
<p/>In short, it seemed as though mirth and gaiety were frisking and gambolling all over the meadow. CHAPTER XX. WHEREIN AN ACCOUNT
<p/>THE POOR Scarce had the fair Aurora given bright Phoebus time to dry the liquid pearls upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) golden locks with the heat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) fervent rays, when Don Quixote, shaking off sloth from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) limbs, sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet and called to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire Sancho, who was still snoring; seeing which Don Quixote ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thus addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>):

<p/>The distress of seeing the sky turn brazen, and withhold its needful moisture from the earth, is not felt by the servant but by the master, who in time of scarcity and famine must support him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) who has served him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in times of plenty and abundance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There comes, if I don't mistake, from the quarter of that arcade a steam and a smell a great deal more like fried rashers than galingale or thyme; a wedding that begins with smells like that, by my faith, ought to be plentiful and unstinting.''

<p/>the poor man should be content with what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can get, and not go looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea.
<p/>I will bet my arm that Camacho could bury Basilio in reals; and if that be so, as no doubt it is, what a fool Quiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses and jewels
<p/>They won't give a pint of wine at the tavern for a good cast of the bar or a neat thrust of the sword.
<p/>Talents and accomplishments that can't be turned into money, let Count Dirlos have them; but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash, I wish my condition of life was as becoming as they are.
<p/>Camacho must have given her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) and will give her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), and take Basilio's bar-throwing and sword-play. On a good foundation you can raise a good building, and the best foundation in the world is money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>; it is my belief, if thou wert allowed to continue all thou beginnest every instant, thou wouldst have no time left for eating or sleeping; for thou wouldst spend it all in talking.''
<p/>If your worship had a good memory,'' replied Sancho, ``you would remember the articles of our agreement before we started from home this last time; one of them was that I was to be let say all I liked, so long as it was not against my neighbour or your worship's authority; and so far, it seems to me, I have not broken the said article.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember no such article, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``and even if it were so, I desire you to hold your tongue and come along; for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the valleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of the morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon.
<p/>Sancho did as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and putting the saddle on Rocinante and the pack-saddle on Dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurely pace entered the arcade.
<p/>The first thing that presented itself to Sancho's eyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree, and in the fire at which it was to be roasted there was burning a middling-sized mountain of faggots, and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in the ordinary mould of common pots, for they were six half wine-jars, each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter-house; they swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons.
<p/>Countless were the hares ready skinned and the plucked fowls that hung on the trees for burial in the pots, numberless the wildfowl and game of various sorts suspended from the branches that the air might keep them cool.
<p/>Sancho counted more than sixty wine skins of over six gallons each, and all filled, as it proved afterwards, with generous wines.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For God's sake, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote here, <div class="bookquote">``stop that harangue ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' There were, besides, piles of the whitest bread, like the heaps of corn one sees on the threshing-floors.
<p/>There was a wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick-work, and two cauldrons full of oil, bigger than those of a dyer's shop, served for cooking fritters, which when fried were taken out with two mighty shovels, and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by.
<p/>In the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking-pigs, which, sewn up there, served to give it tenderness and flavour.
<p/>The spices of different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by the quarter, and all lay open to view in a great chest.
<p/>Of cooks and cook-maids there were over fifty, all clean, brisk, and blithe. In short, all the preparations made for the wedding were in rustic style, but abundant enough to feed an army.
<p/>The first to captivate and take his (<font color='blue'><b>cooks</b></font>) fancy were the pots, out of which he (<font color='blue'><b>cooks</b></font>) would have very gladly helped himself to a moderate pipkinful; then the wine skins secured his (<font color='blue'><b>cooks</b></font>) affections; and lastly, the produce of the frying-pans, if, indeed, such imposing cauldrons may be called frying-pans; and unable to control himself or bear it any longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>cooks</b></font>) approached one of the busy cooks and civilly but hungrily begged permission to soak a scrap of bread in one of the pots; to which the cook made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Brother, this is not a day on which hunger is to have any sway, thanks to the rich Camacho; get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or two, and much good may they do you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div><p/>Sancho observed all, contemplated all, and everything won his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' Wait a bit,'' said the cook; <div class="bookquote">``sinner that I am!
<p/>how particular and bashful you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook sinner</b></font>)</div>and so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) seized a bucket and plunging it into one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese, and said to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Fall to, friend, and take the edge off your appetite with these skimmings until dinner-time comes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to put them in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' Well then,'' said the cook, ``take spoon and all; for Camacho's wealth and happiness furnish everything.
<p/>While Sancho fared thus, Don Quixote was watching the entrance, at one end of the arcade, of some twelve peasants, all in holiday and gala dress, mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field trappings and a number of little bells attached to their petrals, who, marshalled in regular order, ran not one but several courses over the meadow, with jubilant shouts and cries of ``Long live Camacho and Quiteria!
<p/>Hearing this, Don Quixote said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``It is easy to see these folk have never seen my Dulcinea del Toboso; for if they had they would be more moderate in their praises of this Quiteria of theirs.
<p/>Shortly after this, several bands of dancers of various sorts began to enter the arcade at different points, and among them one of sword-dancers composed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant and high-spirited mien, clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with handkerchiefs embroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of those on the mares asked an active youth who led them if any of the dancers had been wounded.
<p/>As yet, thank God, no one has been wounded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we are all safe and sound;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at once began to execute complicated figures with the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) comrades, with so many turns and so great dexterity, that although Don Quixote was well used to see dances of the same kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had never seen any so good as this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) also admired another that came in composed of fair young maidens, none of whom seemed to be under fourteen or over eighteen years of age, all clad in green stuff, with their locks partly braided, partly flowing loose, but all of such bright gold as to vie with the sunbeams, and over them they wore garlands of jessamine, roses, amaranth, and honeysuckle.
<p/>At their head were a venerable old man and an ancient dame, more brisk and active, however, than might have been expected from their years.
<p/>The notes of a Zamora bagpipe accompanied them, and with modesty in their countenances and in their eyes, and lightness in their feet, they looked the best dancers in the world.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zamora</b></font>) as rich as she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) is fair; and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) the fairest on earth! '' '' '' Following these there came an artistic dance of the sort they call <div class="bookquote">``speaking dances.
<p/>It was composed of eight nymphs in two files, with the god Cupid leading one and Interest the other, the former furnished with wings, bow, quiver and arrows, the latter in a rich dress of gold and silk of divers colours.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The nymphs that followed Love bore their names written on white parchment in large letters on their backs. '' Poetry'' was the name of the first, <div class="bookquote">``Wit''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of the second, <div class="bookquote">``Birth''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of the third, and <div class="bookquote">``Valour''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of the fourth.
<p/>Those that followed Interest were distinguished in the same way; the badge of the first announced <div class="bookquote">``Liberality,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>that of the second <div class="bookquote">``Largess,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the third <div class="bookquote">``Treasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the fourth ``Peaceful Possession.
<p/>In front of them all came a wooden castle drawn by four wild men, all clad in ivy and hemp stained green, and looking so natural that they nearly terrified Sancho.
<p/>On the front of the castle and on each of the four sides of its frame it bore the inscription <div class="bookquote">``Castle of Caution.
<p/>Four skillful tabor and flute players accompanied them, and the dance having been opened, Cupid, after executing two figures, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) eyes and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) bow against a damsel who stood between the turrets of the castle, and thus addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>)
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' : I am the mighty God whose sway Is potent over land and sea. The heavens above us own me; nay, The shades below acknowledge me.
<p/>I know not fear , I have my will, Whate'er my whim or fancy be ; For me there's no impossible, I order, bind, forbid, set free.
<p/>Interest then came forward and went through two more figures, and as soon as the tabors ceased, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said: But mightier than Love am I,
<p/>Having concluded the stanza he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) discharged an arrow at the top of the castle, and went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) place. Though Love it be that leads me on, Than mine no lineage is more high, Or older, underneath the sun.
<p/>To use me rightly few know how, To act without me fewer still, For I am Interest, and I vow For evermore to do thy will.
<p/>Interest retired, and Poetry came forward, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had gone through her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) figures like the others, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) eyes on the damsel of the castle, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said: With many a fanciful conceit, Fair Lady, winsome Poesy Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) soul, an offering at thy feet, Presents in sonnets unto thee.
<p/>If thou my homage wilt not scorn, Thy fortune, watched by envious eyes, On wings of poesy upborne Shall be exalted to the skies.
<p/>Poetry withdrew, and on the side of Interest Liberality advanced, and after having gone through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) figures, said: To give, while shunning each extreme,
<p/>But thee, fair lady, to enrich, Myself a prodigal I'll prove, A vice not wholly shameful, which May find its fair excuse in love.
<p/>In the same manner all the characters of the two bands advanced and retired, and each executed its figures, and delivered its verses, some of them graceful, some burlesque, but Don Quixote's memory -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had an excellent one-RRB- only carried away those that have been just quoted.
<p/>All then mingled together, forming chains and breaking off again with graceful, unconstrained gaiety; and whenever Love passed in front of the castle he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shot his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arrows up at it, while Interest broke gilded pellets against it.
<p/>At length, after they had danced a good while, Interest drew out a great purse, made of the skin of a large brindled cat and to all appearance full of money, and flung it at the castle, and with the force of the blow the boards fell asunder and tumbled down, leaving the damsel exposed and unprotected.
<p/>Interest and the characters of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) band advanced, and throwing a great chain of gold over her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) neck pretended to take her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) and lead her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) away captive, on seeing which, Love and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) supporters made as though they would release her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), the whole action being to the accompaniment of the tabors and in the form of a regular dance.
<p/>The wild men made peace between them, and with great dexterity readjusted and fixed the boards of the castle, and the damsel once more ensconced herself within; and with this the dance wound up, to the great enjoyment of the beholders.
<p/>The sparing hand, the over-free, Therein consists, so wise men deem, The virtue Liberality. Don Quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and arranged it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had a nice taste in devising things of the sort.
<p/>I will lay a wager,'' said Don Quixote, ``that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friend of Camacho's than of Basilio's, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) is better at satire than at vespers; he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) has introduced the accomplishments of Basilio and the riches of Camacho very neatly into the dance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is easy to see thou art a clown, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and one of that sort that cry `Long life to the conqueror.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' Sancho Panza, who was listening to all this, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``The king is my cock; I stick to Camacho.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know of what sort I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but I know very well I'll never get such elegant skimmings off Basilio's pots as these I have got off Camacho's;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) the bucketful of geese and hens, and seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite, saying, <div class="bookquote">``A fig for the accomplishments of Basilio!
<p/>As much as thou hast so much art thou worth, and as much as thou art worth so much hast thou.
<p/>As a grandmother of mine used to say, there are only two families in the world, the Haves and the Haven'ts; and she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) stuck to the Haves; and to this day, Senor Don Quixote, people would sooner feel the pulse of `Have,' than of `Know;' an ass covered with gold looks better than a horse with a pack-saddle.
<p/>So once more I say I stick to Camacho, the bountiful skimmings of whose pots are geese and hens, hares and rabbits; but of Basilio's, if any ever come to hand, or even to foot, they'll be only rinsings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course I have finished it,'' replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``because I see your worship takes offence at it; but if it was not for that, there was work enough cut out for three days.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hast thou finished thy harangue, Sancho?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' <div class="bookquote">``God grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote.
<p/>At the rate we are going,'' said Sancho, ``I'll be chewing clay before your worship dies; and then, maybe, I'll be so dumb that I'll not say a word until the end of the world, or, at least, till the day of judgment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even should that happen, O Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``thy silence will never come up to all thou hast talked, art talking, and wilt talk all thy life; moreover, it naturally stands to reason, that my death will come before thine; so I never expect to see thee dumb, not even when thou art drinking or sleeping, and that is the utmost I can say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>I mean Death, who devours the lamb as soon as the sheep, and, as I have heard our curate say, treads with equal foot upon the lofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the poor.
<p/>That lady is more mighty than dainty, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is in no way squeamish, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) devours all and is ready for all, and fills her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) alforjas with people of all sorts, ages, and ranks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is no reaper that sleeps out the noontide; at all times she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is reaping and cutting down, as well the dry grass as the green; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never seems to chew, but bolts and swallows all that is put before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has a canine appetite that is never satisfied; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has no belly, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shows she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has a dropsy and is athirst to drink the lives of all that live, as one would drink a jug of cold water.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say no more, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote at this; <div class="bookquote">``don't try to better it, and risk a fall; for in truth what thou hast said about death in thy rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said.
<p/>I tell thee, Sancho, if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thou mightst take a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``In good faith, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``there's no trusting that fleshless one, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) preaches well who lives well,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and I know no more theology than that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Nor needst thou,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but I cannot conceive or make out how it is that, the fear of God being the beginning of wisdom, thou, who art more afraid of a lizard than of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), knowest so much.
<p/>Pass judgment on your chivalries, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and don't set yourself up to judge of other men's fears or braveries, for I am as good a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leave me to despatch these skimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be called to account for in the other world;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began a fresh attack on the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) aroused Don Quixote's, who no doubt would have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) not been prevented by what must be told farther on.
<p/>While Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth the last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were uttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop, shouting, to receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching with musical instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, and accompanied by the priest and the relatives of both, and all the most distinguished people of the surrounding villages.
<p/>When Sancho saw the bride, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``By my faith, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) is not dressed like a country girl, but like some fine court lady; egad, as well as I can make out, the patena she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) wears rich coral, and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) green Cuenca stuff is thirty-pile velvet; and then the white linen trimming--by my oath, but it's satin!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' CHAPTER XXI. IN WHICH CAMACHO'S WEDDING IS CONTINUED, WITH OTHER DELIGHTFUL INCIDENTS Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hands--jet rings on them!
<p/>May I never have luck if they're not gold rings, and real gold, and set with pearls as white as a curdled milk, and every one of them worth an eye of one's head!
<p/>Whoreson baggage, what hair she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) has! if it's not a wig, I never saw longer or fairer all the days of my life.
<p/>See how bravely she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) bears herself--and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) shape! Wouldn't you say she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters of dates?
<p/>for the trinkets she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) has hanging from her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hair and neck look just like them. I swear in my heart she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) is a brave lass, and fit `to pass over the banks of Flanders.'
<p/>'' Don Quixote laughed at Sancho's boorish eulogies and thought that, saving his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had never seen a more beautiful woman.
<p/>The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt, because of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for their wedding on the morrow.
<p/>They advanced towards a theatre that stood on one side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were to plight their troth, and from which they were to behold the dances and plays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud outcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Wait a little, ye, as inconsiderate as ye are hasty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words all turned round, and perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose black coat garnished with crimson patches like flames.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was crowned -LRB-as was presently seen-RRB- with a crown of gloomy cypress, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) held a long staff.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) approached he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was recognised by everyone as the gay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to see what would come of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) words, in dread of some catastrophe in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) appearance at such a moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) came up at last weary and breathless, and planting himself in front of the bridal pair, drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) staff, which had a steel spike at the end, into the ground, and, with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) thus addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) in a hoarse, trembling voice:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to the holy law we acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; nor art thou ignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertions would improve my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respect due to thy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to my true love, wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth serves to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) not only good fortune but supreme happiness; and now to complete it -LRB-not that I think he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deserves it, but inasmuch as heaven is pleased to bestow it upon him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)-RRB-, I will, with my own hands, do away with the obstacle that may interfere with it, and remove myself from between you.
<p/>and let the poor Basilio die, Basilio whose poverty clipped the wings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) happiness, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) to the grave!
<p/>And so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) seized the staff he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) had driven into the ground, and leaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath that concealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt being planted in the ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himself upon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade appeared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) blood, and transfixed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) own weapon.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) friends at once ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) aid, filled with grief at his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) misery and sad fate, and Don Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened to support him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arms, and found he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had not yet ceased to breathe.
<p/>They were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who was standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had confessed him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), as the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death.
<p/>Long live the rich Camacho! many a happy year may he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) live with the ungrateful Quiteria! ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Basilio, however, reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain,
<p/>, I might still hope that my rashness would find pardon, as by its means I attained the bliss of being thine.
<p/>Hearing this the priest bade him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) think of the welfare of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) soul rather than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore God's pardon for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sins and for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rash resolve; to which Basilio replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) was determined not to confess unless Quiteria first gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) mind and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) courage to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) confession.
<p/>Don Quixote hearing the wounded man's entreaty, exclaimed aloud that what Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that might be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Senor Camacho's honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the brave Basilio as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) received her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) direct from her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) father.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If thou wouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand as my bride in this last fatal moment ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>In this case,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it will be only to say `yes,' and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave.
<p/>Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio's friends, imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) to allow Quiteria to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hand, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they moved, nay, forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>), to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it
<p/>At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), some with prayers, and others with tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hand to poor Basilio; but she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) have given any reply had not the priest bade her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) decide quickly what she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) meant to do, as Basilio now had his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) soul at his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) teeth, and there was no time for hesitation.
<p/>On this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, and repentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) eyes already turned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) head, his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) breathing short and painful, murmuring the name of Quiteria between his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) teeth, and apparently about to die like a heathen and not like a Christian.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was satisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) wishes for a moment. Quiteria approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), and kneeling, demanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) hand by signs without speaking.
<p/>Basilio opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) eyes and gazing fixedly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>), said, ``O Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life, for I have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest me in accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing the dread shadow of death over my eyes?
<p/>What I entreat of thee, O thou fatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this, or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee.
<p/>While uttering these words he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) showed such weakness that the bystanders expected each return of faintness would take his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life with it.
<p/>Then Quiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) right hand the hand of Basilio, said, <div class="bookquote">``No force would bend my will; as freely, therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of a lawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free will, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought upon thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Basilio</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I give it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Basilio</b></font>)</div>said Basilio, <div class="bookquote">``not agitated or distracted, but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me, thus do I give myself to be thy husband.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Basilio</b></font>)</div><p/>And I give myself to be thy wife,'' said Quiteria, ``whether thou livest many years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For one so badly wounded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>observed Sancho at this point, <div class="bookquote">``this young man has a great deal to say; they should make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leave off billing and cooing, and attend to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul; for to my thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has it more on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue than at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth.
<p/>Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply moved and with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, and implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly wedded man, who, the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) received the blessing, started nimbly to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been sheathed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' All the bystanders were astounded, and some, more simple than inquiring, began shouting, <div class="bookquote">``A miracle, a miracle!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bystanders</b></font>)</div><p/>The priest, perplexed and amazed, made haste to examine the wound with both hands, and found that the blade had passed, not through Basilio's flesh and ribs, but through a hollow iron tube full of blood, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) had adroitly fixed at the place, the blood, as was afterwards ascertained, having been so prepared as not to congeal.
<p/>But Basilio replied, <div class="bookquote">``No miracle, no miracle; only a trick, a trick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Basilio</b></font>)</div>In short, the priest and Camacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools of.
<p/>The bride showed no signs of displeasure at the deception; on the contrary, hearing them say that the marriage, being fraudulent, would not be valid, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) confirmed it afresh, whence
<p/>Camacho and his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) supporters were so mortified that they proceeded to revenge themselves by violence, and a great number of them drawing their swords attacked Basilio, in whose protection as many more swords were in an instant unsheathed, while Don Quixote taking the lead on horseback, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance over his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm and well covered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shield, made all give way before him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Sancho, who never found any pleasure or enjoyment in such doings, retreated to the wine-jars from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) delectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy place, that spot would be respected.
<p/>they all concluded that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding between the pair, whereat '' Hold, sirs, hold!
<p/>'' cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; <div class="bookquote">``we have no right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us: remember love and war are the same thing, and as in war it is allowable and common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, so in the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to attain the desired end are justifiable, provided they be not to the discredit or dishonour of the loved object.
<p/>Quiteria belonged to Basilio and Basilio to Quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven. Camacho is rich, and can purchase his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) pleasure when, where, and as it pleases him (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>).
<p/>Basilio has but this ewe-lamb, and no one, however powerful he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) may be, shall take her (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) from him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>); these two whom God hath joined man cannot separate; and
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who attempts it must first pass the point of this lance;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brandished it so stoutly and dexterously that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) overawed all who did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on Camacho's mind that it banished her (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) at once from his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) thoughts; and so the counsels of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man, prevailed with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and by their means he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) partisans were pacified and tranquillised, and to prove it put up their swords again, inveighing against the pliancy of Quiteria rather than the craftiness of Basilio;
<p/>Camacho maintaining that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such a love for Basilio, she (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) would have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) too as a married woman, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) ought to thank heaven more for having taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) than for having given her (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>).
<p/>Camacho and those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) following, therefore, being consoled and pacified, those on Basilio's side were appeased; and the rich Camacho, to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) felt no resentment for the trick, and did not care about it, desired the festival to go on just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) were married in reality.
<p/>Neither Basilio, however, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) bride, nor their followers would take any part in it, and they withdrew to Basilio's village; for the poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who follow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those who flatter and dance attendance on them.
<p/>Sancho alone had a cloud on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) soul, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found himself debarred from waiting for Camacho's splendid feast and festival, which lasted until night; and thus dragged away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) moodily followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) master, who accompanied Basilio's party, and left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) the flesh-pots of Egypt; though in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) took them with him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>), and their now nearly finished skimmings that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) carried in the bucket conjured up visions before his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) eyes of the glory and abundance of the good cheer he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) was losing.
<p/>With them they carried Don Quixote, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as a man of worth and a stout one. And so, vexed and dejected though not hungry, without dismounting from Dapple he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) followed in the footsteps of Rocinante.
<p/>CHAPTER XXII. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE GRAND ADVENTURE OF THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS IN THE HEART OF LA MANCHA, WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE
<p/>Many and great were the attentions shown to Don Quixote by the newly married couple, who felt themselves under an obligation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for coming forward in defence of their cause; and they exalted his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wisdom to the same level with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) courage, rating him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as a Cid in arms, and a Cicero in eloquence.
<p/>Worthy Sancho enjoyed himself for three days at the expense of the pair, from whom they learned that the sham wound was not a scheme arranged with the fair Quiteria, but a device of Basilio's, who counted on exactly the result they had seen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) confessed, it is true, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) had confided his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) idea to some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) friends, so that at the proper time they might aid him (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) purpose and insure the success of the deception.
<p/>That,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``is not and ought not to be called deception which aims at virtuous ends;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and the marriage of lovers he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) maintained to be a most excellent end, reminding them, however, that love has no greater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love is all gaiety, enjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in the possession of the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) love, and poverty and want are the declared enemies of all these; which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said to urge Senor Basilio to abandon the practice of those accomplishments he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was skilled in, for though they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fame, they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) no money, and apply himself to the acquisition of wealth by legitimate industry, which will never fail those who are prudent and persevering.
<p/>The poor man who is a man of honour -LRB-if indeed a poor man can be a man of honour-RRB- has a jewel when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a fair wife, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honour is taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and slain.
<p/>The fair woman who is a woman of honour, and whose husband is poor, deserves to be crowned with the laurels and crowns of victory and triumph.
<p/>Beauty by itself attracts the desires of all who behold it, and the royal eagles and birds of towering flight stoop on it as on a dainty lure; but if beauty be accompanied by want and penury, then the ravens and the kites and other birds of prey assail it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who stands firm against such attacks well deserves to be called the crown of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Remember, O prudent Basilio,'' added Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``it was the opinion of a certain sage, I know not whom, that there was not more than one good woman in the whole world; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) advice was that each one should think and believe that this one good woman was his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own wife, and in this way he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would live happy.
<p/>I myself am not married, nor, so far, has it ever entered my thoughts to be so; nevertheless I would venture to give advice to anyone who might ask it, as to the mode in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should seek a wife such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would be content to marry.
<p/>The first thing I would recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), would be to look to good name rather than to wealth, for a good woman does not win a good name merely by being good, but by letting it be seen that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is so, and open looseness and freedom do much more damage to a woman's honour than secret depravity.
<p/>If you take a good woman into your house it will be an easy matter to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good, and even to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still better; but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to mend her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme to another.
<p/>BROUGHT TO A HAPPY TERMINATION ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' I do not say it is impossible, but I look upon it as difficult.
<p/>Sancho, listening to all this, said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``This master of mine, when I say anything that has weight and substance, says I might take a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons; but I say of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) begins stringing maxims together and giving advice not only might he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) take a pulpit in hand, but two on each finger, and go into the market-places to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heart's content.
<p/>I used to think in my heart that the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knew was what belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) chivalry; but there is nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) won't have a finger in.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Devil take you for a knight-errant, what a lot of things you know! '' Sancho muttered this somewhat aloud, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master overheard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and asked, <div class="bookquote">``What art thou muttering there, Sancho?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I'm not saying anything or muttering anything,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I was only saying to myself that I wish I had heard what your worship has said just now before I married; perhaps I'd say now, `The ox that's loose licks himself well.'''

<p/>Thou dost wrong, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``to speak ill of thy wife; for after all she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is the mother of thy children.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are quits,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>returned Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) speaks ill of me whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) takes it into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head, especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is jealous; and Satan himself could not put up with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) then.

(<font color='red'><b>the couple</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' In fine, they remained three days with the newly married couple, by whom they were entertained and treated like kings.
<p/>Don Quixote begged the fencing licentiate to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a guide to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the way to the cave of Montesinos, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) had a great desire to enter it and see with his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) own eyes if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the country were true.
<p/>The licentiate said he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) would get him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) a cousin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) own, a famous scholar, and one very much given to reading books of chivalry, who would have great pleasure in conducting him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) to the mouth of the very cave, and would show him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) the lakes of Ruidera, which were likewise famous all over La Mancha, and even all over Spain; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) would find him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) entertaining, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) was a youth who could write books good enough to be printed and dedicated to princes.
<p/>The cousin arrived at last, leading an ass in foal, with a pack-saddle covered with a parti-coloured carpet or sackcloth; Sancho saddled Rocinante, got Dapple ready, and stocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alforjas, along with which went those of the cousin, likewise well filled; and so, commending themselves to God and bidding farewell to all, they set out, taking the road for the famous cave of Montesinos.
<p/>On the way Don Quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was by profession a humanist, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pursuits and studies were making books for the press, all of great utility and no less entertainment to the nation.
<p/>One was called <div class="bookquote">``The Book of Liveries,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) described seven hundred and three liveries, with their colours, mottoes, and ciphers, from which gentlemen of the court might pick and choose any they fancied for festivals and revels, without having to go a-begging for them from anyone, or puzzling their brains, as the saying is, to have them appropriate to their objects and purposes; <div class="bookquote">``for,''  (<font color='red'><b>anyone</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``I give the jealous, the rejected, the forgotten, the absent, what will suit them, and fit them without fail.
<p/>I have another book, too, which I shall call `Metamorphoses, or the Spanish Ovid,' one of rare and original invention, for imitating Ovid in burlesque style, I show in it who the Giralda of Seville and the Angel of the Magdalena were, what the sewer of Vecinguerra at Cordova was, what the bulls of Guisando, the Sierra Morena, the Leganitos and Lavapies fountains at Madrid, not forgetting those of the Piojo, of the Cano Dorado, and of the Priora; and all with their allegories, metaphors, and changes, so that they are amusing, interesting, and instructive, all at once.
<p/>Another book I have which I call `The Supplement to Polydore Vergil,' which treats of the invention of things, and is a work of great erudition and research, for I establish and elucidate elegantly some things of great importance which Polydore omitted to mention.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cano</b></font>) forgot to tell us who was the first man in the world that had a cold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cano</b></font>) head, and who was the first to try salivation for the French disease, but I give it accurately set forth, and quote more than five-and-twenty authors in proof of it, so you may perceive I have laboured to good purpose and that the book will be of service to the whole world.
<p/>Sancho, who had been very attentive to the cousin's words, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), ``Tell me, senor--and God give you luck in printing your books-can you tell me -LRB-for of course you know, as you know everything-RRB- who was the first man that scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``for there is no doubt but Adam had a head and hair; and being the first man in the world he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have scratched himself sometimes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>answered the cousin, <div class="bookquote">``I could not at this moment say positively without having investigated it; I will look it up when I go back to where I have my books, and will satisfy you the next time we meet, for this will not be the last time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``don't give yourself any trouble about it, for I have just this minute hit upon what I asked you.
<p/>The first tumbler in the world, you must know, was Lucifer, when they cast or pitched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) out of heaven; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) came tumbling into the bottomless pit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>said the cousin; and said Don Quixote, ``Sancho, that question and answer are not thine own; thou hast heard them from some one else.

(<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' Nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn't go looking for help from my neighbours.''
<p/>Thou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote; ``for there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving things that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a farthing to the understanding or memory.
<p/>In this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that night they put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues to the cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to provide himself with ropes, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might be tied and lowered into its depths.
<p/>Don Quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless pit he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant to see where it went to; so they bought about a hundred fathoms of rope, and next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at the cave, the mouth of which is spacious and wide, but full of thorn and wild-fig bushes and brambles and briars, so thick and matted that they completely close it up and cover it over.
<p/>On coming within sight of it the cousin, Sancho, and Don Quixote dismounted, and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly with the ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>)
<p/>Sancho said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Mind what you are about, master mine; don't go burying yourself alive, or putting yourself where you'll be like a bottle put to cool in a well; it's no affair or business of your worship's to become the explorer of this, which must be worse than a Moorish dungeon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had said this and finished the tying -LRB-which was not over the armour but only over the doublet-RRB- Don Quixote observed, <div class="bookquote">``It was careless of us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle-bell to be tied on the rope close to me, the sound of which would show that I was still descending and alive; but as that is out of the question now, in God's hand be it to guide me;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and forthwith he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knees and in a low voice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring God to aid him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and grant him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) success in this to all appearance perilous and untried adventure, and then exclaimed aloud, <div class="bookquote">``O mistress of my actions and movements, illustrious and peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, if so be the prayers and supplications of this fortunate lover can reach thy ears, by thy incomparable beauty
<p/>I entreat thee to listen to them, for they but ask thee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that I stand in such need of them.
<p/>I am about to precipitate, to sink, to plunge myself into the abyss that is here before me, only to let the world know that while thou dost favour me there is no impossibility I will not attempt and accomplish.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' The drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough,'' said Sancho Panza. ''
<p/>With these words he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) approached the cavern, and perceived that it was impossible to let himself down or effect an entrance except by sheer force or cleaving a passage; so drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) sword he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) began to demolish and cut away the brambles at the mouth of the cave, at the noise of which a vast multitude of crows and choughs flew out of it so thick and so fast that they knocked Don Quixote down; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had been as much of a believer in augury as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was a Catholic Christian he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have taken it as a bad omen and declined to bury himself in such a place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) got up, however, and as there came no more crows, or night-birds like the bats that flew out at the same time with the crows, the cousin and Sancho giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) rope, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lowered himself into the depths of the dread cavern; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) entered it
<p/>Sancho sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) blessing after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), making a thousand crosses over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and saying, <div class="bookquote">``God, and the Pena de Francia, and the Trinity of Gaeta guide thee, flower and cream of knights-errant.
<p/>There thou goest, thou dare-devil of the earth, heart of steel, arm of brass; once more, God guide thee and send thee back safe, sound, and unhurt to the light of this world thou art leaving to bury thyself in the darkness thou art seeking there;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and the cousin offered up almost the same prayers and supplications.
<p/>Don Quixote kept calling to them to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rope and more rope, and they gave it out little by little, and by the time the calls, which came out of the cave as out of a pipe, ceased to be heard they had let down the hundred fathoms of rope.
<p/>They were inclined to pull Don Quixote up again, as they could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) no more rope; however, they waited about half an hour, at the end of which time they began to gather in the rope again with great ease and without feeling any weight, which made them fancy Don Quixote was remaining below; and persuaded that it was so, Sancho wept bitterly, and hauled away in great haste in order to settle the question.
<p/>When, however, they had come to, as it seemed, rather more than eighty fathoms they felt a weight, at which they were greatly delighted; and at last, at ten fathoms more, they saw Don Quixote distinctly, and Sancho called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), saying, ``Welcome back, senor, for we had begun to think you were going to stop there to found a family.
<p/>But Don Quixote answered not a word, and drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) out entirely they perceived he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes shut and every appearance of being fast asleep.
<p/>They stretched him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) on the ground and untied him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not awake; however, they rolled him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back and forwards and shook and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) about, so that after some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) came to himself, stretching himself just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) were waking up from a deep and sound sleep, and looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``God forgive you, friends; ye have taken me away from the sweetest and most delightful existence and spectacle that ever human being enjoyed or beheld.
<p/>Now indeed do I know that all the pleasures of this life pass away like a shadow and a dream, or fade like the flower of the field.
<p/>O tearful Guadiana, and ye O hapless daughters of Ruidera who show in your waves the tears that flowed from your beauteous eyes!
<p/>The cousin and Sancho Panza listened with deep attention to the words of Don Quixote, who uttered them as though with immense pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) drew them up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) very bowels.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>O ill-fated Montesinos! O sore-wounded Durandarte! O unhappy Belerma! '' They begged of him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) to explain himself, and tell them what he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) had seen in that hell down there.
<p/>Hell do you call it?'' said Don Quixote; ``call it by no such name, for it does not deserve it, as ye shall soon see.
<p/>They spread the cousin's sackcloth on the grass, and put the stores of the alforjas into requisition, and all three sitting down lovingly and sociably, they made a luncheon and a supper of it all in one; and when the sackcloth was removed, Don Quixote of La Mancha said, <div class="bookquote">``Let no one rise, and attend to me, my sons, both of you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) then begged them to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) something to eat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was very hungry. '' CHAPTER XXIII. OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS
<p/>THE INCOMPARABLE DON QUIXOTE SAID HE (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) SAW IN THE PROFOUND CAVE OF MONTESINOS, THE IMPOSSIBILITY AND MAGNITUDE OF WHICH CAUSE THIS
<p/>It was about four in the afternoon when the sun, veiled in clouds, with subdued light and tempered beams, enabled Don Quixote to relate, without heat or inconvenience, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had seen in the cave of Montesinos to his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) two illustrious hearers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) began as follows:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A matter of some twelve or fourteen times a man's height down in this pit, on the right-hand side, there is a recess or space, roomy enough to contain a large cart with its mules.
<p/>A little light reaches it through some chinks or crevices, communicating with it and open to the surface of the earth.
<p/>This recess or space I perceived when I was already growing weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended by the rope, travelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty or knowledge of where I was going, so I resolved to enter it and rest myself for a while.
<p/>I called out, telling you not to let out more rope until I bade you, but you cannot have heard me.
<p/>ADVENTURE TO BE DEEMED APOCRYPHAL I then gathered in the rope you were sending me, and making a coil or pile of it
<p/>I seated myself upon it, ruminating and considering what I was to do to lower myself to the bottom, having no one to hold me up; and as I was thus deep in thought and perplexity, suddenly and without provocation a profound sleep fell upon me, and
<p/>when I least expected it, I know not how, I awoke and found myself in the midst of the most beautiful, delightful meadow that nature could produce or the most lively human imagination conceive.
<p/>Nevertheless, I felt my head and breast to satisfy myself whether it was I myself who was there or some empty delusive phantom; but touch, feeling, the collected thoughts that passed through my mind, all convinced me that I was the same then and there that I am this moment.
<p/>Next there presented itself to my sight a stately royal palace or castle, with walls that seemed built of clear transparent crystal; and through two great doors that opened wide therein, I saw coming forth and advancing towards me a venerable old man, clad in a long gown of mulberry-coloured serge that trailed upon the ground.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders and breast he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a green satin collegiate hood, and covering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head a black Milanese bonnet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snow-white beard fell below his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) girdle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried no arms whatever, nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fair-sized filberts, each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bearing, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gait, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dignity and imposing presence held me spellbound and wondering.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approached me, and the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did was to embrace me closely, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to me, `For a long time now, O valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, we who are here enchanted in these solitudes have been hoping to see thee, that thou mayest make known to the world what is shut up and concealed in this deep cave, called the cave of Montesinos, which thou hast entered, an achievement reserved for thy invincible heart and stupendous courage alone to attempt.
<p/>Come with me, illustrious sir, and I will show thee the marvels hidden within this transparent castle, whereof I am the alcaide and perpetual warden; for I am Montesinos himself, from whom the cave takes its name.'
<p/>The instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) was Montesinos, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) if the story they told in the world above here was true, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) had taken out the heart of his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) great friend Durandarte from his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) breast with a little dagger, and carried it to the lady Belerma, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) friend when at the point of death had commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) said in reply that they spoke the truth in every respect except as to the dagger, for it was not a dagger, nor little, but a burnished poniard sharper than an awl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I opened my eyes, I rubbed them, and found I was not asleep but thoroughly awake. '' '' That poniard must have been made by Ramon de Hoces the Sevillian,'' said Sancho.
<p/>I do not know,'' said Don Quixote; ``it could not have been by that poniard maker, however, because Ramon de Hoces was a man of yesterday, and the affair of Roncesvalles, where this mishap occurred, was long ago; but the question is of no great importance, nor does it affect or make any alteration in the truth or substance of the story.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>said the cousin; <div class="bookquote">``continue, Senor Don Quixote, for I am listening to you with the greatest pleasure in the world.
<p/>And with no less do I tell the tale,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``and so, to proceed--the venerable Montesinos led me into the palace of crystal, where, in a lower chamber, strangely cool and entirely of alabaster, was an elaborately wrought marble tomb, upon which I beheld, stretched at full length, a knight, not of bronze, or marble, or jasper, as are seen on other tombs, but of actual flesh and bone.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) right hand -LRB-which seemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy, a sign of great strength in its owner-RRB- lay on the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) heart; but before I could put any question to Montesinos, he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>), seeing me gazing at the tomb in amazement, said to me, `This is my friend Durandarte, flower and mirror of the true lovers and valiant knights of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is held enchanted here, as I myself and many others are, by that French enchanter Merlin, who, they say, was the devil's son; but
<p/>my belief is, not that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was the devil's son, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knew, as the saying is, a point more than the devil.
<p/>How or why he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) enchanted us, no one knows, but time will tell, and I suspect that time is not far off.
<p/>What I marvel at is, that I know it to be as sure as that it is now day, that Durandarte ended his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) life in my arms, and that, after his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) death, I took out his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) heart with my own hands; and indeed it must have weighed more than two pounds, for, according to naturalists, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) who has a large heart is more largely endowed with valour than he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) who has a small one.
<p/>Then, as this is the case, and as the knight did really die, how comes it that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) now moans and sighs from time to time, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) were still alive?'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' As he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said this, the wretched Durandarte cried out in a loud voice: O cousin Montesinos! '
<p/>T was my last request of thee, When my soul hath left the body, And that lying dead I be, With thy poniard or thy dagger Cut the heart from out my breast, And bear it to Belerma.
<p/>On hearing which, the venerable Montesinos fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) knees before the unhappy knight, and with tearful eyes exclaimed, `Long since, Senor Durandarte, my beloved cousin, long since have I done what you bade me on that sad day when I lost you
<p/>; I took out your heart as well as I could, not leaving an atom of it in your breast, I wiped it with a lace handkerchief, and I took the road to France with it,
<p/>having first laid you in the bosom of the earth with tears enough to wash and cleanse my hands of the blood that covered them after wandering among your bowels; and more by token, O cousin of my soul, at the first village I came to after leaving Roncesvalles, I sprinkled a little salt upon your heart to keep it sweet, and bring it, if not fresh, at least pickled, into the presence of the lady Belerma, whom, together with you, myself, Guadiana your squire, the duenna Ruidera and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) seven daughters and two nieces, and many more of your friends and acquaintances, the sage Merlin has been keeping enchanted here these many years; and although more than five hundred have gone by, not one of us has died; Ruidera and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) daughters and nieces alone are missing, and these, because of the tears they shed, Merlin, out of the compassion he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) seems to have felt for them, changed into so many lakes, which to this day in the world of the living, and in the province of La Mancha, are called the Lakes of Ruidera.
<p/>The seven daughters belong to the kings of Spain and the two nieces to the knights of a very holy order called the Order of St. John.
<p/>Guadiana your squire, likewise bewailing your fate, was changed into a river of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) own name, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) came to the surface and beheld the sun of another heaven, so great was his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) grief at finding he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) was leaving you, that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) plunged into the bowels of the earth; however, as he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) cannot help following his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) natural course, he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) from time to time comes forth and shows himself to the sun and the world.
<p/>The lakes aforesaid send him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) their waters, and with these, and others that come to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) makes a grand and imposing entrance into Portugal; but for all that, go where he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) may, he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) shows his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) melancholy and sadness, and takes no pride in breeding dainty choice fish, only coarse and tasteless sorts, very different from those of the golden Tagus.
<p/>All this that I tell you now, O cousin mine, I have told you many times before, and as you make no answer, I fear that either you believe me not, or do not hear me, whereat I feel God knows what grief.
<p/>I have now news to give you, which, if it serves not to alleviate your sufferings, will not in any wise increase them.
<p/>Know that you have here before you -LRB-open your eyes and you will see-RRB- that great knight of whom the sage Merlin has prophesied such great things; that Don Quixote of La Mancha
<p/>I mean, who has again, and to better purpose than in past times, revived in these days knight-errantry, long since forgotten, and by whose intervention and aid it may be we shall be disenchanted; for great deeds are reserved for great men.'
<p/>''`And if that may not be,' said the wretched Durandarte in a low and feeble voice, `if that may not be, then, my cousin, I say <div class="bookquote">``patience and shuffle;'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>' and turning over on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) side, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) relapsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) former silence without uttering another word.
<p/>This was my last request. '' '' And now there was heard a great outcry and lamentation, accompanied by deep sighs and bitter sobs.
<p/>I looked round, and through the crystal wall I saw passing through another chamber a procession of two lines of fair damsels all clad in mourning, and with white turbans of Turkish fashion on their heads.
<p/>Behind, in the rear of these, there came a lady, for so from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dignity she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed to be, also clad in black, with a white veil so long and ample that it swept the ground.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turban was twice as large as the largest of any of the others; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyebrows met, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nose was rather flat, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mouth was large but with ruddy lips, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) teeth, of which at times she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) allowed a glimpse, were seen to be sparse and ill-set, though as white as peeled almonds.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands a fine cloth, and in it, as well as I could make out, a heart that had been mummied, so parched and dried was it.
<p/>Montesinos told me that all those forming the procession were the attendants of Durandarte and Belerma, who were enchanted there with their master and mistress, and that the last, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) who carried the heart in the cloth, was the lady Belerma, who, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) damsels, four days in the week went in procession singing, or rather weeping, dirges over the body and miserable heart of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cousin; and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) appeared to me somewhat ill-favoured or not so beautiful as fame reported her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>), it was because of the bad nights and worse days that she (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) passed in that enchantment, as I could see by the great dark circles round her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) sickly complexion; `her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) sallowness, and the rings round her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) eyes,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `are not caused by the periodical ailment usual with women, for it is many months and even years since she (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) has had any, but by the grief her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) own heart suffers because of that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) holds in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) hand perpetually, and which recalls and brings back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) memory the sad fate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) lost lover; were it not for this, hardly would the great Dulcinea del Toboso, so celebrated in all these parts, and even in the world, come up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) for beauty, grace, and gaiety.'
<p/>said I at this, `tell your story as you ought, Senor Don Montesinos, for you know very well that all comparisons are odious, and
<p/>there is no occasion to compare one person with another; the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Belerma</b></font>) is, and the lady Dona Belerma is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dona</b></font>) is and has been, and that's enough.'
<p/>To which he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) made answer, `Forgive me, Senor Don Quixote; I own I was wrong and spoke unadvisedly in saying that the lady Dulcinea could scarcely come up to the lady Belerma; for it were enough for me to have learned, by what means I know not, that you are her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) knight, to make me bite my tongue out before I compared her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) to anything save heaven itself.'
<p/>After this apology which the great Montesinos made me, my heart recovered itself from the shock I had received in hearing my lady compared with Belerma.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``that your worship did not get upon the old fellow and bruise every bone of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with kicks, and pluck his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beard until you didn't leave a hair in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Sancho, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``it would not have been right in me to do that, for we are all bound to pay respect to the aged, even though they be not knights, but especially to those who are, and who are enchanted; I only know I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) brought in the many other questions and answers we exchanged.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot understand, Senor Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>remarked the cousin here, <div class="bookquote">``how it is that your worship, in such a short space of time as you have been below there, could have seen so many things, and said and answered so much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>''`Hold hard!' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``How long is it since I went down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>asked Don Quixote. '' Little better than an hour,'' replied Sancho.
<p/>That cannot be,'' returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``because night overtook me while I was there, and day came, and it was night again and day again three times; so that, by my reckoning, I have been three days in those remote regions beyond our ken.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' My master must be right,'' replied Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for as everything that has happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is by enchantment , maybe what seems to us an hour would seem three days and nights there.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' That's it,'' said Don Quixote. '' And did your worship eat anything all that time, senor?'' asked the cousin.
<p/>'' I never touched a morsel,'' answered Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``nor did I feel hunger, or think of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' And do the enchanted eat?'' said the cousin.
<p/>They neither eat,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``nor are they subject to the greater excrements, though it is thought that their nails, beards, and hair grow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' And do the enchanted sleep, now, senor? '' asked Sancho. '' Certainly not,'' replied Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``at least, during those three days I was with them
<p/>not one of them closed an eye, nor did I either.''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' The proverb, `Tell me what company thou keepest and I'll tell thee
<p/>what thou art,' is to the point here,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``your worship keeps company with enchanted people that are always fasting and watching; what wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you are with them?
<p/>if I say that of all this you have told us now, may God take me--I was just going to say the devil--
<p/>But forgive me, senor, if I believe a single particle. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>said the cousin, <div class="bookquote">``has Senor Don Quixote, then, been lying?
<p/>Why, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wished it he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has not had time to imagine and put together such a host of lies.
<p/>I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that this Merlin, or those enchanters who enchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw and discoursed with down there, stuffed your imagination or your mind with all this rigmarole you have been treating us to, and all that is still to come.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe my master lies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' If not, what dost thou believe?'' asked Don Quixote. '' ''
<p/>All that might be, Sancho,'' replied Don Quixote; ``but it is not so, for everything that I have told you I saw with my own eyes, and touched with my own hands.
<p/>But what will you say when I tell you now how, among the countless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me -LRB-of which at leisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in the course of our journey, for they would not be all in place here-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) showed me three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats over the pleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them
<p/>I knew one to be the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two those same country girls that were with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and that we spoke to on the road from El Toboso!
<p/>I asked Montesinos if he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) knew them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) did not, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) thought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction, for it was only a few days before that they had made their appearance in those meadows; but I was not to be surprised at that, because there were a great many other ladies there of times past and present, enchanted in various strange shapes, and among them he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) had recognised Queen Guinevere and her (<font color='blue'><b>Guinevere</b></font>) dame Quintanona, she (<font color='blue'><b>Guinevere</b></font>) who poured out the wine for Lancelot when he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) came from Britain.
<p/>When Sancho Panza heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master say this he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was ready to take leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) senses, or die with laughter; for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) knew the real truth about the pretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) himself had been the enchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) mind at last that, beyond all doubt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) wits and stark mad, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It was an evil hour, a worse season, and a sorrowful day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the other world, and an unlucky moment when you met with Senor Montesinos, who has sent you back to us like this.
<p/>You were well enough here above in your full senses, such as God had given you, delivering maxims and giving advice at every turn, and not as you are now, talking the greatest nonsense that can be imagined.''

<p/>I spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not utter a word in reply; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back on me and took to flight, at such a pace that crossbow bolt could not have overtaken her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>Montesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would be useless, particularly as the time was drawing near when it would be necessary for me to quit the cavern.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) told me, moreover, that in course of time he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) would let me know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) and Belerma, and Durandarte, and all who were there, were to be disenchanted.
<p/>But of all I saw and observed down there, what gave me most pain was, that while Montesinos was speaking to me, one of the two companions of the hapless Dulcinea approached me on one without my having seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) coming, and with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) eyes said to me, in a low, agitated voice, `My lady Dulcinea del Toboso kisses your worship's hands, and entreats you to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) the favour of letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) know how you are; and, being in great need, she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) also entreats your worship as earnestly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) can to be so good as to lend her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) half a dozen reals, or as much as you may have about you, on this new dimity petticoat that I have here; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) promises to repay them very speedily.'
<p/>had not I was amazed and taken aback by such a message, and turning to Senor Montesinos I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>), `Is it possible, Senor Montesinos, that persons of distinction under enchantment can be in need?'
<p/>To which he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) replied, `Believe me, Senor Don Quixote, that which is called need is to be met with everywhere, and penetrates all quarters and reaches everyone, and does not spare even the enchanted; and as the lady Dulcinea del Toboso sends to beg those six reals, and the pledge is to all appearance a good one, there is nothing for it but to give them to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), for no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be in some great strait.' 'I will take no pledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),' I replied, `nor yet can I give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asks, for all I have is four reals; which I gave
<p/>I met along the road-RRB-, and I said, `Tell your mistress, my dear, that I am grieved to the heart because of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) distresses, and wish I was a Fucar to remedy them, and that I would have her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) know that I cannot be, and ought not be, in health while deprived of the happiness of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) and enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) discreet conversation, and that I implore her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) as earnestly as I can, to allow herself to be seen and addressed by this her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) captive servant and forlorn knight.
<p/>Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), too, that when she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) least expects it she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) will hear it announced that I have made an oath and vow after the fashion of that which the Marquis of Mantua made to avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) nephew Baldwin, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) at the point of death in the heart of the mountains, which was, not to eat bread off a tablecloth, and other trifling matters which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) added, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) had avenged him (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>); and I will make the same to take no rest, and to roam the seven regions of the earth more thoroughly than the Infante Don Pedro of Portugal ever roamed them, until I have disenchanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>).'
<p/>All that and more, you owe my lady,' the damsel's answer to me, and taking the four reals, instead of making me a curtsey she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) cut a caper, springing two full yards into the air.''
<p/>-LRB-they were those which thou, Sancho, gavest me the other day to bestow in alms upon the poor ' <div class="bookquote">``O blessed God!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sancho aloud at this, <div class="bookquote">``is it possible that such things can be in the world, and that enchanters and enchantments can have such power in it as to have changed my master's right senses into a craze so full of absurdity!
<p/>O senor, senor, for God's sake, consider yourself, have a care for your honour, and give no credit to this silly stuff that has left you scant and short of wits.
<p/>Thou talkest in this way because thou lovest me, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``and not being experienced in the things of the world, everything that has some difficulty about it seems to thee impossible; but time will pass, as I said before, and I will tell thee some of the things I saw down there which will make thee believe what I have related now, the truth of which admits of neither reply nor question.
<p/>AS THEY ARE NECESSARY TO THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF THIS GREAT HISTORY He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who translated this great history from the original written by its first author, Cide Hamete Benengeli, says that on coming to the chapter giving the adventures of the cave of Montesinos he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) found written on the margin of it, in Hamete's own hand, these exact words: ``I cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that is written in the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the valiant Don Quixote; and for this reason, that all the adventures that have occurred up to the present have been possible and probable; but as for this one of the cave, I see no way of accepting it as true, as it passes all reasonable bounds.
<p/>For me to believe that Don Quixote could lie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) being the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) time, is impossible; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would not have told a lie though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) were shot to death with arrows.
<p/>On the other hand, I reflect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) related and told the story with all the circumstances detailed, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not in so short a space have fabricated such a vast complication of absurdities; if, then, this adventure seems apocryphal, it is no fault of mine; and so, without affirming its falsehood or its truth, I write it down.
<p/>Decide for thyself in thy wisdom, reader; for I am not bound, nor is it in my power, to do more; though certain it is they say that at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) death he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) retracted, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had invented it, thinking it matched and tallied with the adventures he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had read of in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) histories.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) goes on to say: The cousin was amazed as well at Sancho's boldness as at the patience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, and concluded that the good temper the latter displayed arose from the happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt at having seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lady Dulcinea, even enchanted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) was; because otherwise the words and language
<p/>Sancho had addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) deserved a thrashing; for indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to have been rather impudent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) now observed, <div class="bookquote">``I, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, look upon the time I have spent in travelling with your worship as very well employed, for I have gained four things in the course of it; the first is that I have made your acquaintance, which I consider great good fortune; the second, that I have learned what the cave of Montesinos contains, together with the transformations of Guadiana and of the lakes of Ruidera; which will be of use to me for the Spanish Ovid that I have in hand; the third, to have discovered the antiquity of cards, that they were in use at least in the time of Charlemagne, as may be inferred from the words you say Durandarte uttered when, at the end of that long spell while Montesinos was talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) woke up and said, `Patience and shuffle.'
<p/>This phrase and expression he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) could not have learned while he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) was enchanted, but only before he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) had become so, in France, and in the time of the aforesaid emperor Charlemagne.
<p/>And this demonstration is just the thing for me for that other book I am writing, the `Supplement to Polydore Vergil on the Invention of Antiquities;' for I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) never thought of inserting that of cards in his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) book, as I mean to do in mine, and it will be a matter of great importance, particularly when I can cite so grave and veracious an authority as Senor Durandarte.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' CHAPTER XXIV. WHEREIN ARE RELATED A THOUSAND TRIFLING MATTERS, AS TRIVIAL '' And the fourth thing is, that I have ascertained the source of the river Guadiana, heretofore unknown to mankind.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I should like to know, if by God's favour they grant you a licence to print those books of yours-which I doubt--to whom do you mean to dedicate them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; '' There are lords and grandees in Spain to whom they can be dedicated,'' said the cousin.
<p/>Not many,'' said Don Quixote; ``not that they are unworthy of it, but because they do not care to accept books and incur the obligation of making the return that seems due to the author's labour and courtesy.
<p/>I know who makes up for all the rest, and more-how much more, if I ventured to say, perhaps I should stir up envy in many a noble breast; but let this stand over for some more convenient time, and let us go and look for some place to shelter ourselves in to-night.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not far from this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>said the cousin, <div class="bookquote">``there is a hermitage, where there lives a hermit, who they say was a soldier, and who has the reputation of being a good Christian and a very intelligent and charitable man.
<p/>Close to the hermitage he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) has a small house which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) built at his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own cost, but though small it is large enough for the reception of guests.
<p/>Few hermits are without them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cousin</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``for those we see now-a-days are not like the hermits of the Egyptian deserts who were clad in palm-leaves, and lived on the roots of the earth.
<p/>But do not think that by praising these I am disparaging the others; all I mean to say is that the penances of those of the present day do not come up to the asceticism and austerity of former times; but it does not follow from this that they are not all worthy; at least I think them so; and at the worst the hypocrite who pretends to be good does less harm than the open sinner.
<p/>At this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man on foot, proceeding at a rapid pace, and beating a mule loaded with lances and halberds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot stop, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the man; <div class="bookquote">``for the arms you see I carry here are to be used to-morrow, so I must not delay; God be with you.
<p/>But if you want to know what I am carrying them for, I mean to lodge to-night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage, and if you be going the same road you will find me there, and I will tell you some curious things; once more God be with you;''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) urged on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mule at such a pace that Don Quixote had no time to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what these curious things were that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant to tell them; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was somewhat inquisitive, and always tortured by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) anxiety to learn something new, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) decided to set out at once, and go and pass the night at the inn instead of stopping at the hermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt.
<p/>Don Quixote called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Stay, good fellow; you seem to be making more haste than suits that mule. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Accordingly they mounted and all three took the direct road for the inn, which they reached a little before nightfall.
<p/>The instant Sancho heard this he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) steered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Dapple towards it, and Don Quixote and the cousin did the same; but it seems Sancho's bad luck so ordered it that the hermit was not at home, for so a sub-hermit they found in the hermitage told them.
<p/>On the road the cousin proposed they should go up to the hermitage to drink a sup. They called for some of the best.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) replied that her (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master had none, but that if they liked cheap water she (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would give it with great pleasure.
<p/>If I found any in water,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``there are wells along the road where I could have had enough of it.
<p/>Leaving the hermitage, they pushed on towards the inn, and a little farther they came upon a youth who was pacing along in front of them at no great speed, so that they overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) carried a sword over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shoulder, and slung on it a budget or bundle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) clothes apparently, probably his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) breeches or pantaloons, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cloak and a shirt or two; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it in places, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shirt out; his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stockings were of silk, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shoes square-toed as they wear them at court.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) age might have been eighteen or nineteen; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was of a merry countenance, and to all appearance of an active habit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went along singing seguidillas to beguile the wearisomeness of the road.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Ah, Camacho's wedding, and plentiful house of Don Diego, how often do I miss you!'' As they came up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) was just finishing one, which the cousin got by heart
<p/>and they say ran thus-- I'm off to the wars For the want of pence, Oh, had I but money I'd show more sense.
<p/>The first to address him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was Don Quixote, who said, <div class="bookquote">``You travel very airily, sir gallant; whither bound, may we ask, if it is your pleasure to tell us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>To which the youth replied, <div class="bookquote">``The heat and my poverty are the reason of my travelling so airily, and it is to the wars that I am bound.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>replied the youth, <div class="bookquote">``in this bundle I carry velvet pantaloons to match this jacket; if I wear them out on the road, I shall not be able to make a decent appearance in them in the city, and I have not the wherewithal to buy others; and so for this reason, as well as to keep myself cool, I am making my way in this fashion to overtake some companies of infantry that are not twelve leagues off, in which I shall enlist, and there will be no want of baggage trains to travel with after that to the place of embarkation, which they say will be Carthagena; I would rather have the King for a master, and serve him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) in the wars, than serve a court pauper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How poverty? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>asked Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``the heat one can understand.''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' And did you get any bounty, now?'' asked the cousin.
<p/>If I had been in the service of some grandee of Spain or personage of distinction,'' replied the youth, <div class="bookquote">``I should have been safe to get it; for that is the advantage of serving good masters, that out of the servants' hall men come to be ancients or captains, or get a good pension.
<p/>But I, to my misfortune, always served place-hunters and adventurers, whose keep and wages were so miserable and scanty that half went in paying for the starching of one's collars; it would be a miracle indeed if a page volunteer ever got anything like a reasonable bounty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div><p/>And tell me, for heaven's sake,'' asked Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``is it possible, my friend, that all the time you served you never got any livery?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They gave me two,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>replied the page; ``but just as when one quits a religious community before making profession, they strip him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the dress of the order and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own clothes,
<p/>so did my masters return me mine; for as soon as the business on which they came to court was finished, they went home and took back the liveries they had given merely for show.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What spilorceria!--as an Italian would say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``but for all that, consider yourself happy in having left court with as worthy an object as you have, for there is nothing on earth more honourable or profitable than serving, first of all God, and then one's king and natural lord, particularly in the profession of arms, by which, if not more wealth, at least more honour is to be won than by letters, as I have said many a time; for though letters may have founded more great houses than arms, still those founded by arms have
<p/>I know not what superiority over those founded by letters, and a certain splendour belonging to them that distinguishes them above all.
<p/>And bear in mind what I am now about to say to you, for it will be of great use and comfort to you in time of trouble; it is, not to let your mind dwell on the adverse chances that may befall you; for the worst of all is death, and if it be a good death, the best of all is to die.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) answered, that which is unexpected, which comes suddenly and unforeseen; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) answered like a pagan, and one without the knowledge of the true God, yet, as far as sparing our feelings is concerned, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was right; for suppose you are killed in the first engagement or skirmish, whether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine, what matters it?
<p/>It is only dying, and all is over; and according to Terence, a soldier shows better dead in battle, than alive and safe in flight; and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) is obedient to his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) captains and those in command over him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>).
<p/>And remember, my son, that it is better for the soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet, and that if old age should come upon you in this honourable calling, though you may be covered with wounds and crippled and lame, it will not come upon you without honour, and that such as poverty cannot lessen; especially now that provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old and disabled soldiers; for it is not right to deal with them after the fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves when they are old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses under the pretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, from which they cannot expect to be released except by death.
<p/>But for the present I won't say more than get ye up behind me on my horse as far as the inn, and sup with me there, and to-morrow you shall pursue your journey, and God give you as good speed as your intentions deserve.
<p/>The page did not accept the invitation to mount, though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did that to supper at the inn; and here they say Sancho said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``God be with you for a master; is it possible that a man who can say things so many and so good as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has said just now, can say that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw the impossible absurdities he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reports about the cave of Montesinos?

<p/>The instant they entered Don Quixote asked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds, and was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was in the stable seeing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mule; which was what Sancho and the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts, giving the best manger and the best place in the stable to Rocinante.

<p/>; so seating himself on a bench, with Don Quixote beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and the cousin, the page, Sancho Panza, and the landlord, for a senate and an audience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) began his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) story in this way: <div class="bookquote">``You must know that in a village four leagues and a half from this inn, it so happened that one of the regidors, by the tricks and roguery of a servant girl of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) -LRB-it's too long a tale to tell-RRB-, lost an ass; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) did all he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) possibly could to find it, it was all to no purpose.
<p/>A fortnight might have gone by, so the story goes, since the ass had been missing, when, as the regidor who had lost it was standing in the plaza, another regidor of the same town said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), `Pay me for good news, gossip; your ass has turned up.'
<p/>`In the forest,' said the finder; 'I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) this morning without pack-saddle or harness of any sort, and so lean that it went to one's heart to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>).
<p/>I tried to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) before me and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) to you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) is already so wild and shy that when I went near him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) made off into the thickest part of the forest.
<p/>If you have a mind that we two should go back and look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), let me put up this she-ass at my house
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>' That I will, and well, gossip,' said the other; `but tell us, where has he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) turned up?' and I'll be back at once.'
<p/>You will be doing me a great kindness,' said the owner of the ass, `and I'll try to pay it back in the same coin.'
<p/>It is with all these circumstances, and in the very same way I am telling it now, that those who know all about the matter tell the story.
<p/>Well then, the two regidors set off on foot, arm in arm, for the forest, and coming to the place where they hoped to find the ass they could not find him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to be seen anywhere about, search as they might.
<p/>Seeing, then, that there was no sign of him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), the regidor who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) said to the other, `Look here, gossip; a plan has occurred to me, by which, beyond a doubt, we shall manage to discover the animal, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) is stowed away in the bowels of the earth, not to say the forest.
<p/>' Here it is. I can bray to perfection, and if you can ever so little , the thing's as good as done.'
<p/>`Ever so little did you say, gossip?' said the other; `by God, I'll not give in to anybody, not even to the asses themselves.'
<p/>We'll soon see,' said the second regidor, `for my plan is that you should go one side of the forest, and I the other, so as to go all round about it; and every now and then you will bray and I will bray; and it cannot be but that the ass will hear us, and answer us if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is in the forest.'
<p/>To which the owner of the ass replied, `It's an excellent plan, I declare, gossip, and worthy of your great genius;' and the two separating as agreed, it so fell out that they brayed almost at the same moment, and each, deceived by the braying of the other, ran to look, fancying the ass had turned up at last.
<p/>When they came in sight of one another, said the loser, `Is it possible, gossip, that it was not my ass that brayed?'
<p/>Well then, I can tell you, gossip,' said the ass's owner, `that between you and an ass there is not an atom of difference as far as braying goes, for I never in all my life saw or heard anything more natural.' '
<p/>Those praises and compliments belong to you more justly than to me, gossip,' said the inventor of the plan; `for, by the God that made me, you might give a couple of brays odds to the best and most finished brayer in the world; the tone you have got is deep, your voice is well kept up as to time and pitch, and your finishing notes come thick and fast
<p/>; in fact, I own myself beaten, and yield the palm to you, and give in to you in this rare accomplishment.'
<p/>Well then,' said the owner, `I'll set a higher value on myself for the future, and consider that I know something, as I have an excellence of some sort; for though I always thought I brayed well, I never supposed I came up to the pitch of perfection you say.' '
<p/>And I say too,' said the second, `that there are rare gifts going to loss in the world, and that they are ill bestowed upon those who don't know how to make use of them.'
<p/>Ours,' said the owner of the ass, `unless it is in cases like this we have now in hand, cannot be of any service to us, and even in this God grant they may be of some use.'
<p/>So saying they separated, and took to their braying once more, but every instant they were deceiving one another, and coming to meet one another again, until they arranged by way of countersign, so as to know that it was they and not the ass, to give two brays, one after the other.
<p/>In this way, doubling the brays at every step, they made the complete circuit of the forest, but the lost ass never gave them an answer or even the sign of one.
<p/>How could the poor ill-starred brute have answered, when, in the thickest part of the forest, they found him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) devoured by wolves?
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) owner said, 'I was wondering he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did not answer, for if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wasn't dead he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'d have brayed when he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) heard us, or he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'d have been no ass; but for the sake of having heard you bray to such perfection, gossip, I count the trouble I have taken to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) well bestowed, even though I have found him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) dead.' '
<p/>It's in a good hand, gossip,' said the other; `if the abbot sings well, the acolyte is not much behind him (<font color='blue'><b>abbot</b></font>).'
<p/>So they returned disconsolate and hoarse to their village, where they told their friends, neighbours, and acquaintances what had befallen them in their search for the ass, each crying up the other's perfection in braying.
<p/>The whole story came to be known and spread abroad through the villages of the neighbourhood; and the devil, who never sleeps, with his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) love for sowing dissensions and scattering discord everywhere, blowing mischief about and making quarrels out of nothing, contrived to make the people of the other towns fall to braying whenever they saw anyone from our village, as if to throw the braying of our regidors in our teeth.
<p/>Then the boys took to it, which was the same thing for it as getting into the hands and mouths of all the devils of hell; and braying spread from one town to another in such a way that the men of the braying town are as easy to be known as blacks are to be known from whites, and the unlucky joke has gone so far that several times the scoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle with the scoffers, and neither king nor rook, fear nor shame, can mend matters.
<p/>To-morrow or the day after, I believe, the men of my town, that is, of the braying town, are going to take the field against another village two leagues away from ours,
<p/>' ' No, it was I,' said the other. ' ' ' one of those that persecute us most; and that we may turn out well prepared
<p/>These are the curious things I told you I had to tell, and if you don't think them so, I have got no others;'' and with this the worthy fellow brought his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) story to a close.
<p/>Just at this moment there came in at the gate of the inn a man entirely clad in chamois leather, hose, breeches, and doublet, who said in a loud voice, <div class="bookquote">``Senor host, have you room?
<p/>I have bought these lances and halberds you have seen. Here's the divining ape and the show of the Release of Melisendra just coming.
<p/>I forgot to mention that the said Master Pedro had his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) left eye and nearly half his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) cheek covered with a patch of green taffety, showing that something ailed all that side.
<p/>Your worship is welcome, Master Pedro,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>continued the landlord; <div class="bookquote">``but where are the ape and the show, for I don't see them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They are close at hand,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) in the chamois leather, ``but I came on first to know if there was any room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd make the Duke of Alva himself clear out to make room for Master Pedro,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord; <div class="bookquote">``bring in the ape and the show; there's company in the inn to-night that will pay to see that and the cleverness of the ape.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ods body!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``why, it's Master Pedro! We're in for a grand night! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' ''
<p/>So be it by all means,'' said the man with the patch; <div class="bookquote">``I'll lower the price, and be well satisfied if I only pay my expenses; and now I'll go back and hurry on the cart with the ape and the show;''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) went out of the inn.
<p/>Don Quixote at once asked the landlord what this Master Pedro was, and what was the show and what was the ape he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) had with him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>); which the landlord replied, <div class="bookquote">``This is a famous puppet-showman, who for some time past has been going about this Mancha de Aragon, exhibiting a show of the release of Melisendra by the famous Don Gaiferos, one of the best and best-represented stories that have been seen in this part of the kingdom for many a year; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) has also with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) an ape with the most extraordinary gift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being; for if you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) listens attentively to the question, and then jumps on his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) master's shoulder, and pressing close to his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) ear tells him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) the answer which Master Pedro then delivers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) says a great deal more about things past than about things to come; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) does not always hit the truth in every case, most times he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) is not far wrong, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) makes us fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) has got the devil in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) gets two reals for every question if the ape answers; I mean if his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) master answers for him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) has whispered into his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) ear; and so it is believed that this same Master Pedro is very rich.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) is a `gallant man' as they say in Italy, and good company, and leads the finest life in the world; talks more than six, drinks more than a dozen, and all by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) tongue, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) ape, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) show.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Pedro now came back, and in a cart followed the show and the ape--a big one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, but not vicious-looking.
<p/>As soon as Don Quixote saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me, sir fortune-teller, what fish do we catch, and how will it be with us?
<p/>See, here are my two reals,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bade Sancho give them to Master Pedro; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) answered for the ape and said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, this animal does not give any answer or information touching things that are to come; of things past he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) knows something, and more or less of things present.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ape</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I would not give a farthing to be told what's past with me, for who knows that better than I do myself?
<p/>But as you know things present, here are my two reals, and tell me, most excellent sir ape, what is my wife Teresa Panza doing now, and what is she (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) diverting herself with?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Pedro refused to take the money, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I will not receive payment in advance or until the service has been first rendered;''  (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div>and then with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) right hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) gave a couple of slaps on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) left shoulder, and with one spring the ape perched himself upon it, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) mouth to his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) master's ear began chattering his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) teeth rapidly; and having kept this up as long as one would be saying a credo, with another spring he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) brought himself to the ground, and the same instant Master Pedro ran in great haste and fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) knees before Don Quixote, and embracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) legs exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``These legs do I embrace as I would embrace the two pillars of Hercules, O illustrious reviver of knight-errantry, so long consigned to oblivion!
<p/>O never yet duly extolled knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, courage of the faint-hearted, prop of the tottering, arm of the fallen, staff and counsel of all who are unfortunate!
<p/>Don Quixote was thunderstruck, Sancho astounded, the cousin staggered, the page astonished, the man from the braying town agape, the landlord in perplexity, and, in short, everyone amazed at the words of the puppet-showman, who went on to say,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>And to pay for being told what I know would be mighty foolish. '' <div class="bookquote">``And thou, worthy Sancho Panza, the best squire and squire to the best knight in the world!
<p/>Teresa is well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) is at this moment hackling a pound of flax; and more by token she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) has at her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) left hand a jug with a broken spout that holds a good drop of wine, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) solaces herself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) is a lucky one, and if it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) jealousy I would not change her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) for the giantess Andandona, who by my master's account was a very clever and worthy woman; my Teresa is one of those that won't let themselves want for anything, though their heirs may have to pay for it.''
<p/>Be of good cheer, for thy good wife <div class="bookquote">``That I can well believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' <div class="bookquote">``Now I declare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who reads much and travels much sees and knows a great deal.
<p/>because what amount of persuasion could have persuaded me that there are apes in the world that can divine as I have seen now with my own eyes?
<p/>For I am that very Don Quixote of La Mancha this worthy animal refers to, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has gone rather too far in my praise; but whatever I may be, I thank heaven that it has endowed me with a tender and compassionate heart, always disposed to do good to all and harm to none.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>If I had money,'' said the page, ``I would ask senor ape what will happen to me in the peregrination I am making.
<p/>To this Master Pedro, who had by this time risen from Don Quixote's feet, replied, ``I have already said that this little beast gives no answer as to the future; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did, not having money would be of no consequence, for to oblige Senor Don Quixote, here present, I would give up all the profits in the world.
<p/>And now, because I have promised it, and to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pleasure, I will set up my show and offer entertainment to all who are in the inn, without any charge whatever.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard this, the landlord, delighted beyond measure, pointed out a place where the show might be fixed, which was done at once.
<p/>Don Quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the ape, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not think it proper that an ape should divine anything, either past or future; so while Master Pedro was arranging the show, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) retired with Sancho into a corner of the stable, where, without being overheard by anyone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Look here, Sancho, I have been seriously thinking over this ape's extraordinary gift, and have come to the conclusion that beyond doubt this Master Pedro, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) master, has a pact, tacit or express, with the devil.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>If the packet is express from the devil,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``it must be a very dirty packet no doubt; but what good can it do Master Pedro to have such packets?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) must have made some compact with the devil to infuse this power into the ape, that he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) may get his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) living, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) has grown rich he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) will give him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) soul, which is what the enemy of mankind wants; this I am led to believe by observing that the ape only answers about things past or present, and the devil's knowledge extends no further; for the future he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knows only by guesswork, and that not always; for it is reserved for God alone to know the times and the seasons, and for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) there is neither past nor future; all is present.
<p/>This being as it is, it is clear that this ape speaks by the spirit of the devil; and I am astonished they have not denounced him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to the Holy Office, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to the question, and forced it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) by whose virtue it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) divines; because it is certain this ape is not an astrologer; neither his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) master nor he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) sets up, or knows how to set up, those figures they call judiciary, which are now so common in Spain that there is not a jade, or page, or old cobbler, that will not undertake to set up a figure as readily as pick up a knave of cards from the ground, bringing to nought the marvellous truth of the science by their lies and ignorance.
<p/>I know of a lady who asked one of these figure schemers whether her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little lap-dog would be in pup and would breed, and how many and of what colour the little pups would be.
<p/>To which senor astrologer, after having set up his (<font color='blue'><b>astrologer</b></font>) figure, made answer that the bitch would be in pup, and would drop three pups, one green, another bright red, and the third parti-coloured, provided she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) conceived between eleven and twelve either of the day or night, and on a Monday or Saturday; but as things turned out, two days after this the bitch died of a surfeit, and senor planet-ruler had the credit all over the place of being a most profound astrologer, as most of these planet-rulers have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I would be glad if your worship would make Master Pedro ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) ape whether what happened your worship in the cave of Montesinos is true; for, begging your worship's pardon, I, for my part, take it to have been all flam and lies, or at any rate something you dreamt.
<p/>That may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote; ``however, I will do what you suggest; though I have my own scruples about it.
<p/>At this point Master Pedro came up in quest of Don Quixote, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the show was now ready and to come and see it, for it was worth seeing.
<p/>Don Quixote explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wish, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ape at once to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) whether certain things which had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the cave of Montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) they appeared to partake of both.
<p/>Upon this Master Pedro, without answering, went back to fetch the ape, and, having placed it in front of Don Quixote and Sancho, said: <div class="bookquote">``See here, senor ape, this gentleman wishes to know whether certain things which happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in the cave called the cave of Montesinos were false or true.
<p/>I say so ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' Thou dost not understand me, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote; '' '' '' ''
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) making the usual sign the ape mounted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ear, and Master Pedro said at once, ``The ape says that the things you saw or that happened to you in that cave are, part of them false, part true; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) only knows this and no more as regards this question; but if your worship wishes to know more, on Friday next he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) will answer all that may be asked him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) virtue is at present exhausted, and will not return to him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) till Friday, as he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) has said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I not say, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that I could not bring myself to believe that all your worship said about the adventures in the cave was true, or even the half of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>The course of events will tell, Sancho,'' replied Don Quixote; ``time, that discloses all things, leaves nothing that it does not drag into the light of day, though it be buried in the bosom of the earth.
<p/>But enough of that for the present; let us go and see Master Pedro's show, for I am sure there must be something novel in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something!''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>said Master Pedro; <div class="bookquote">``this show of mine has sixty thousand novel things in it; let me tell you, Senor Don Quixote, it is one of the best-worth-seeing things in the world this day; but operibus credite et non verbis, and now let's get to work, for it is growing late, and we have a great deal to do and to say and show.
<p/>Don Quixote and Sancho obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and went to where the show was already put up and uncovered, set all around with lighted wax tapers which made it look splendid and bright.
<p/>When they came to it Master Pedro ensconced himself inside it, for it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) who had to work the puppets, and a boy, a servant of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), posted himself outside to act as showman and explain the mysteries of the exhibition, having a wand in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hand to point to the figures as they came out.
<p/>And so, all who were in the inn being arranged in front of the show, some of them standing, and Don Quixote, Sancho, the page, and cousin, accommodated with the best places, the interpreter began to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) will hear or see who reads or hears the next chapter.

<p/>The noise was soon over, and then the boy lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) voice and said, <div class="bookquote">``This true story which is here represented to your worships is taken word for word from the French chronicles and from the Spanish ballads that are in everybody's mouth, and in the mouth of the boys about the streets.

<p/>And that personage who appears there with a crown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) head and a sceptre in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) hand is the Emperor Charlemagne, the supposed father of Melisendra, who, angered to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) son-in-law's inaction and unconcern, comes in to chide him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>); and observe with what vehemence and energy he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) chides him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>), so that you would fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) was going to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) half a dozen raps with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) sceptre; and indeed there are authors who say he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) did give them, and sound ones too; and after having said a great deal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) about imperilling his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) honour by not effecting the release of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) said, so
<p/>Observe, too, how the emperor turns away, and leaves Don Gaiferos fuming; and you see now how in a burst of anger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) flings the table and the board far from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) and calls in haste for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) armour, and asks his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) cousin Don Roland for the loan of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) sword, Durindana, and how Don Roland refuses to lend it, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) company in the difficult enterprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) is undertaking; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) valour and anger, will not accept it, and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) alone will suffice to rescue his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) wife, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) were imprisoned deep in the centre of the earth, and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) retires to arm himself and set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) journey at once.
<p/>Now let your worships turn your eyes to that tower that appears there, which is supposed to be one of the towers of the alcazar of Saragossa, now called the Aljaferia; that lady who appears on that balcony dressed in Moorish fashion is the peerless Melisendra, for many a time she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used to gaze from thence upon the road to France, and seek consolation in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) captivity by thinking of Paris and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Don Gaiferos sits, For Melisendra is forgotten now. the tale runs, Enough I've said, see to it now. Observe, too, a new incident which now occurs, such as, perhaps, never was seen.
<p/>Observe now how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) prints a kiss upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips, and what a hurry she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is in to spit, and wipe them with the white sleeve of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smock, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bewails herself, and tears her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fair hair as though it were to blame for the wrong.
<p/>Observe, too, that the stately Moor who is in that corridor is King Marsilio of Sansuena, who, having seen the Moor's insolence, at once orders him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) -LRB-though his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) kinsman and a great favourite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>)-RRB- to be seized and given two hundred lashes, while carried through the streets of the city according to custom, with criers going before him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) and officers of justice behind; and here you see them come out to execute the sentence, although the offence has been scarcely committed; for among the Moors there are no indictments nor remands as with us.
<p/>Do you not see that Moor, who silently and stealthily, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) lip, approaches Melisendra from behind? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Don Quixote called out, <div class="bookquote">``Child, child, go straight on with your story, and don't run into curves and slants, for to establish a fact clearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and said Master Pedro from within, <div class="bookquote">``Boy, stick to your text and do as the gentleman bids you
<p/>; it's the best plan; keep to your plain song, and don't attempt harmonies, for they are apt to break down from being over fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div><p/>``This figure that you see here on horseback, covered with a Gascon cloak, is Don Gaiferos himself, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) wife, now avenged of the insult of the amorous Moor, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer and more tranquil countenance, has perceived without recognising him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) addresses her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to be some traveller, and holds with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) all that conversation and colloquy in the ballad that runs--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went on to say, If you, sir knight, to France are bound, Oh! for Gaiferos
<p/>which I do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust; suffice it to observe how Don Gaiferos discovers himself, and that by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) joyful gestures Melisendra shows us she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>); and what is more, we now see she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on the haunches of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) good husband's horse.
<p/>But ah! unhappy lady, the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is left hanging in the air, unable to reach the ground.
<p/>But you see how compassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need; Don Gaiferos advances, and without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) seizes her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and by force brings her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to the ground, and then with one jerk places her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on the haunches of his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) horse, astraddle like a man, and bids her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hold on tight and clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) neck, crossing them on his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) breast so as not to fall, for the lady Melisendra was not used to that style of riding.
<p/>You see, too, how the neighing of the horse shows his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) satisfaction with the gallant and beautiful burden he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) bears in his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) lord and lady.
<p/>ask-- You see how they wheel round and quit the city, and in joy and gladness take the road to Paris.
<p/>May you reach your longed-for fatherland in safety, and may fortune interpose no impediment to your prosperous journey; may the eyes of your friends and kinsmen behold you enjoying in peace and tranquillity the remaining days of your life--and that they may be as many as those of Nestor!
<p/>Go in peace, O peerless pair of true lovers! '' Here Master Pedro called out again and said, ``Simplicity, boy! None of your high flights; all affectation is bad.
<p/>The interpreter made no answer, but went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``There was no want of idle eyes, that see everything, to see Melisendra come down and mount, and word was brought to King Marsilio, who at once gave orders to sound the alarm; and see what a stir there is, and how the city is drowned with the sound of the bells pealing in the towers of all the mosques.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The interpreter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote at this; ``on that point of the bells Master Pedro is very inaccurate, for bells are not in use among the Moors; only kettledrums, and a kind of small trumpet somewhat like our clarion; to ring bells this way in Sansuena is unquestionably a great absurdity.
<p/>On hearing this, Master Pedro stopped ringing, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't look into trifles, Senor Don Quixote, or want to have things up to a pitch of perfection that is out of reach.
<p/>Are there not almost every day a thousand comedies represented all round us full of thousands of inaccuracies and absurdities, and, for all that, they have a successful run, and are listened to not only with applause, but with admiration and all the rest of it?
<p/>Go on, boy, and don't mind; for so long as I fill my pouch, no matter if I show as many inaccuracies as there are motes in a sunbeam.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div><p/>``See what a numerous and glittering crowd of horsemen issues from the city in pursuit of the two faithful lovers, what a blowing of trumpets there is, what sounding of horns, what beating of drums and tabors; I fear me they will overtake them and bring them back tied to the tail of their own horse, which would be a dreadful sight.
<p/>Don Quixote, however, seeing such a swarm of Moors and hearing such a din, thought it would be right to aid the fugitives, and standing up he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exclaimed in a loud voice, <div class="bookquote">``Never, while I live, will I permit foul play to be practised in my presence on such a famous knight and fearless lover as Don Gaiferos.
<p/>Halt! ill-born rabble, follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) not nor pursue him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>), or ye will have to reckon with me in battle!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and suiting the action to the word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) sword, and with one bound placed himself close to the show, and with unexampled rapidity and fury began to shower down blows on the puppet troop of Moors, knocking over some, decapitating others, maiming this one and demolishing that; and among many more he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) delivered one down stroke which, if Master Pedro had not ducked, made himself small, and got out of the way, would have sliced off his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) head as easily as if it had been made of almond-paste.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``True enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; and the boy went on: '' Master Pedro kept shouting, ``Hold hard! Senor Don Quixote!
<p/>can't you see they're not real Moors you're knocking down and killing and destroying, but only little pasteboard figures! Look--sinner that I am!--how you're wrecking and ruining all that I'm worth!
<p/>But in spite of this, Don Quixote did not leave off discharging a continuous rain of cuts, slashes, downstrokes, and backstrokes, and at length, in less than the space of two credos, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) brought the whole show to the ground, with all its fittings and figures shivered and knocked to pieces, King Marsilio badly wounded, and the Emperor Charlemagne with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) crown and head split in two.
<p/>The whole audience was thrown into confusion, the ape fled to the roof of the inn, the cousin was frightened, and even Sancho Panza himself was in mighty fear, for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) swore after the storm was over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) had never seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master in such a furious passion.
<p/>The complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished, Don Quixote became a little calmer, said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had here before me now all those who do not or will not believe how useful knights-errant are in the world; just think, if I had not been here present, what would have become of the brave Don Gaiferos and the fair Melisendra!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>Depend upon it, by this time those dogs would have overtaken them and inflicted some outrage upon them. So, then, long live knight-errantry beyond everything living on earth this day!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it live, and welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>said Master Pedro at this in a feeble voice, ``and let me die, for I am so unfortunate that I can say with King Don Rodrigo--
<p/>Not half an hour, nay, barely a minute ago, I saw myself lord of kings and emperors, with my stables filled with countless horses, and my trunks and bags with gay dresses unnumbered; and now I find myself ruined and laid low, destitute and a beggar, and above all without my ape, for, by my faith, my teeth will have to sweat for it before I have him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) caught; and all through the reckless fury of sir knight here, who, they say, protects the fatherless, and rights wrongs, and does other charitable deeds; but whose generous intentions have been found wanting in my case only, blessed and praised be the highest heavens!
<p/>Yesterday was I lord of Spain To-day I've not a turret left That I may call mine own. Verily, knight of the rueful figure he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) must be to have disfigured mine.
<p/>Sancho Panza was touched by Master Pedro's words, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), ``Don't weep and lament, Master Pedro; you break my heart; let me tell you my master, Don Quixote, is so catholic and scrupulous a Christian that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) can make out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has done you any wrong, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will own it, and be willing to pay for it and make it good, and something over and above.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only let Senor Don Quixote pay me for some part of the work he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) has destroyed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Master Pedro</b></font>)</div>said Master Pedro, ``and I would be content, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) worship would ease his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) conscience, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) cannot be saved who keeps what is another's against the owner's will, and makes no restitution.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``but at present I am not aware that I have got anything of yours, Master Pedro.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>returned Master Pedro; <div class="bookquote">``and these relics lying here on the bare hard ground--what scattered and shattered them but the invincible strength of that mighty arm?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' And whose were the bodies they belonged to but mine? And what did I get my living by but by them?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now am I fully convinced,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``of what I had many a time before believed; that the enchanters who persecute me do nothing more than put figures like these before my eyes, and then change and turn them into what they please.
<p/>In truth and earnest, I assure you gentlemen who now hear me, that to me everything that has taken place here seemed to take place literally, that Melisendra was Melisendra, Don Gaiferos Don Gaiferos, Marsilio Marsilio, and Charlemagne Charlemagne.
<p/>That was why my anger was roused; and to be faithful to my calling as a knight-errant I sought to give aid and protection to those who fled, and with this good intention
<p/>If the result has been the opposite of what I intended, it is no fault of mine, but of those wicked beings that persecute me; but, for all that, I am willing to condemn myself in costs for this error of mine, though it did not proceed from malice; let Master Pedro see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) wants for the spoiled figures, for I agree to pay it at once in good and current money of Castile.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Pedro made him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) a bow, saying, ``I expected no less of the rare Christianity of the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, true helper and protector of all destitute and needy vagabonds; master landlord here and the great Sancho Panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisers between your worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worth or may be worth.
<p/>The landlord and Sancho consented, and then Master Pedro picked up from the ground King Marsilio of Saragossa with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) head off, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Here you see how impossible it is to restore this king to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) former state, so I think, saving your better judgments, that for his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) death, decease, and demise, four reals and a half may be given me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marsilio</b></font>)</div><p/>Well then, for this cleavage from top to bottom,'' continued Master Pedro, taking up the split Emperor Charlemagne, <div class="bookquote">``it would not be much if I were to ask five reals and a quarter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlemagne</b></font>)</div><p/>I did what you have seen. '' <div class="bookquote">``Proceed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' '' It's not little,'' said Sancho. '' Nor is it much,'' said the landlord; ``make it even, and say five reals.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) have the whole five and a quarter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``for the sum total of this notable disaster does not stand on a quarter more or less; and make an end of it quickly, Master Pedro, for it's getting on to supper-time, and I have some hints of hunger.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For this figure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Master Pedro</b></font>)</div>said Master Pedro, <div class="bookquote">``that is without a nose, and wants an eye, and is the fair Melisendra, I ask, and I am reasonable in my charge, two reals and twelve maravedis.
<p/>The very devil must be in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Master Pedro</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``if Melisendra and her (<font color='blue'><b>Melisendra</b></font>) husband are not by this time at least on the French border, for the horse they rode on seemed to me to fly rather than gallop; so you needn't try to sell me the cat for the hare, showing me here a noseless Melisendra when she (<font color='blue'><b>Melisendra</b></font>) is now, may be, enjoying herself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Melisendra</b></font>) ease with her (<font color='blue'><b>Melisendra</b></font>) husband in France.
<p/>God help every one to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own, Master Pedro, and let us all proceed fairly and honestly; and now go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Master Pedro, perceiving that Don Quixote was beginning to wander, and return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) original fancy, was not disposed to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) escape, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``This cannot be Melisendra, but must be one of the damsels that waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Melisendra</b></font>); so if I'm given sixty maravedis for her (<font color='blue'><b>Melisendra</b></font>), I'll be content and sufficiently paid.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures, which, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction of both parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over and above this sum, which Sancho at once disbursed, Master Pedro asked for two reals for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) trouble in catching the ape.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) have them, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``not to catch the ape, but to get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minute for the good news, to anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady Dona Melisandra and Senor Don Gaiferos were now in France and with their own people.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' '' No one could tell us that better than my ape,'' said Master Pedro; <div class="bookquote">``but there's no devil that could catch him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) now
<p/>; I suspect, however, that affection and hunger will drive him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to come looking for me to-night; but to-morrow will soon be here and we shall see.
<p/>In short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace and good fellowship at Don Quixote's expense, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was the height of generosity.
<p/>Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page came to bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latter resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) journey, towards which, to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), Don Quixote gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) twelve reals.
<p/>Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver with Don Quixote, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knew right well; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rose before the sun, and having got together the remains of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) show and caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ape, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) too went off to seek his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) adventures.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pedro/Pedro Perez</b></font>)</div>The landlord, who did not know Don Quixote, was as much astonished at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mad freaks as at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) generosity.
<p/>they quitted the inn at about eight in the morning and took to the road, where we will leave them to pursue their journey, for this is necessary in order to allow certain other matters to be set forth, which are required to clear up this famous history.
<p/>To conclude, Sancho, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's orders, paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) very liberally, and taking leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) CHAPTER XXVII. WHEREIN IT IS SHOWN WHO MASTER PEDRO AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>MASTER</b></font>) APE WERE,
<p/>TOGETHER WITH THE MISHAP DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, WHICH HE (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) DID NOT CONCLUDE AS HE (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) WOULD HAVE LIKED
<p/>AS HE (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) HAD EXPECTED Cide Hamete, the chronicler of this great history, begins this chapter with these words, <div class="bookquote">``I swear as a Catholic Christian;''  (<font color='red'><b>the chronicler</b></font>)</div>with regard to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) translator says that Cide Hamete's swearing as a Catholic Christian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) being--as no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was--a Moor, only meant that, just as a Catholic Christian taking an oath swears, or ought to swear, what is true, and tell the truth in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) avers, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was telling the truth, as much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) swore as a Catholic Christian, in all he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) chose to write about Quixote, especially in declaring who Master Pedro was and what was the divining ape that astonished all the villages with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) divinations.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) says, then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) who has read the First Part of this history will remember well enough the Gines de Pasamonte whom, with other galley slaves, Don Quixote set free in the Sierra Morena: a kindness for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that evil-minded, ill-conditioned set.
<p/>, Don Quixote called him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>)--it was that stole Dapple from Sancho Panza; which, because by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when was stated in the First Part, has been a puzzle to a good many people, who attribute to the bad memory of the author what was the error of the press.
<p/>In fact, however, Gines stole him (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) while Sancho Panza was asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) back, adopting the plan and device that Brunello had recourse to when he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) stole Sacripante's horse from between his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) legs at the siege of Albracca; and, as has been told, Sancho afterwards recovered him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>This Gines, then, afraid of being caught by the officers of justice, who were looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) numberless rascalities and offences -LRB-which were so many and so great that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) himself wrote a big book giving an account of them-RRB-, resolved to shift his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) quarters into the kingdom of Aragon, and cover up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) left eye, and take up the trade of a puppet-showman; for this, as well as juggling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) knew how to practise to perfection.
<p/>From some released Christians returning from Barbary, it so happened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) bought the ape, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) taught to mount upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) shoulder on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) making a certain sign, and to whisper, or seem to do so, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) ear.
<p/>Thus prepared, before entering any village whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) was bound with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) show and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) ape, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) used to inform himself at the nearest village, or from the most likely person he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) could find, as to what particular things had happened there, and to whom; and bearing them well in mind, the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) did was to exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) show, sometimes one story, sometimes another, but all lively, amusing, and familiar.
<p/>As soon as the exhibition was over he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) brought forward the accomplishments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) ape, assuring the public that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) divined all the past and the present, but as to the future he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) had no skill.
<p/>For each question answered he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) asked two reals, and for some he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) made a reduction, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) happened to feel the pulse of the questioners; and
<p/>when now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) came to houses where things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) knew of had happened to the people living there, even if they did not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) a question, not caring to pay for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) would make the sign to the ape and then declare that it had said so and so, which fitted the case exactly.
<p/>In this way he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) acquired a prodigious name and all ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>); on other occasions, being very crafty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) would answer in such a way that the answers suited the questions; and as no one cross-questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) or pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) to tell how his (<font color='blue'><b>Gines</b></font>) ape divined, he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) made fools of them all and filled his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) pouch.
<p/>The instant he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) entered the inn he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) knew Don Quixote and Sancho, and with that knowledge it was easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to astonish them and all who were there; but it would have cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) dear had Don Quixote brought down his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand a little lower when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cut off King Marsilio's head and destroyed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horsemen, as related in the preceeding chapter.
<p/>OR This Gines de Pasamonte--Don Ginesillo de Parapilla So much for Master Pedro and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) ape; and now to return to Don Quixote of La Mancha.
<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had left the inn he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) determined to visit, first of all, the banks of the Ebro and that neighbourhood, before entering the city of Saragossa, for the ample time there was still to spare before the jousts left him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enough for all.
<p/>With this object in view he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) followed the road and travelled along it for two days, without meeting any adventure worth committing to writing until on the third day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was ascending a hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard a great noise of drums, trumpets, and musket-shots.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) imagined some regiment of soldiers was passing that way, and to see them he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spurred Rocinante and mounted the hill.
<p/>On reaching the top he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw at the foot of it over two hundred men, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), armed with weapons of various sorts, lances, crossbows, partisans, halberds, and pikes, and a few muskets and a great many bucklers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) descended the slope and approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags, make out the colours and distinguish the devices they bore, especially one on a standard or ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in a very life-like style an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its mouth open and its tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of braying; and round it were inscribed in large characters these two lines-- They did not bray in vain, Our alcaldes twain.
<p/>From this device Don Quixote concluded that these people must be from the braying town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said so to Sancho, explaining to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what was written on the standard.
<p/>At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) observed that the man who had told them about the matter was wrong in saying that the two who brayed were regidors, for according to the lines of the standard they were alcaldes.
<p/>To which Sancho replied, ``Senor, there's nothing to stick at in that, for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to be alcaldes of their town afterwards, and so they may go by both titles; moreover, it has nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers were alcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray; for an alcalde is just as likely to bray as a regidor.
<p/>They perceived, in short, clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out to do battle with some other that had jeered it more than was fair or neighbourly.
<p/>Don Quixote proceeded to join them, not a little to Sancho's uneasiness, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) never relished mixing himself up in expeditions of that sort.
<p/>The members of the troop received him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) into the midst of them, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to be some one who was on their side.
<p/>Don Quixote, putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) visor, advanced with an easy bearing and demeanour to the standard with the ass, and all the chief men of the army gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with the usual amazement that everybody felt on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for the first time.
<p/>Don Quixote, seeing them examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) so attentively, and that none of them spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) or put any question to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), determined to take advantage of their silence; so, breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) voice and said, ``Worthy sirs, I entreat you as earnestly as I can not to interrupt an argument I wish to address to you, until you find it displeases or wearies you; and if that come to pass, on the slightest hint you give me I will put a seal upon my lips and a gag upon my tongue.
<p/>With this permission Don Quixote went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``I, sirs, am a knight-errant whose calling is that of arms, and whose profession is to protect those who require protection, and give help to such as stand in need of it.
<p/>Some days ago I became acquainted with your misfortune and the cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revenge yourselves upon your enemies; and having many times thought over your business in my mind, I find that, according to the laws of combat, you are mistaken in holding yourselves insulted; for a private individual cannot insult an entire community; unless it be by defying it collectively as a traitor, because he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) cannot tell who in particular is guilty of the treason for which he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) defies it.
<p/>Of this we have an example in Don Diego Ordonez de Lara, who defied the whole town of Zamora, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Zamora</b></font>) did not know that Vellido Dolfos alone had committed the treachery of slaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Zamora</b></font>) king; and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Zamora</b></font>) defied them all, and the vengeance and the reply concerned all
<p/>; though, to be sure, Senor Don Diego went rather too far, indeed very much beyond the limits of a defiance; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Diego</b></font>) had no occasion to defy the dead, or the waters, or the fishes, or those yet unborn, and all the rest of it as set forth; but let that pass, for when anger breaks out there's no father, governor, or bridle to check the tongue.
<p/>The case being, then, that no one person can insult a kingdom, province, city, state, or entire community, it is clear there is no reason for going out to avenge the defiance of such an insult, inasmuch as it is not one.
<p/>A fine thing it would be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheads every moment with everyone who called them by that name,--or the Cazoleros, Berengeneros, Ballenatos, Jaboneros, or the bearers of all the other names and titles that are always in the mouth of the boys and common people!
<p/>It would be a nice business indeed if all these illustrious cities were to take huff and revenge themselves and go about perpetually making trombones of their swords in every petty quarrel!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' They all bade him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) say what he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) liked, for they would listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) willingly. No, no; God forbid!
<p/>There are four things for which sensible men and well-ordered States ought to take up arms, draw their swords, and risk their persons, lives, and properties.
<p/>The first is to defend the Catholic faith; the second, to defend one's life, which is in accordance with natural and divine law; the third, in defence of one's honour, family, and property; the fourth, in the service of one's king in a just war; and if to these we choose to add a fifth -LRB-which may be included in the second-RRB-, in defence of one's country.
<p/>To these five, as it were capital causes, there may be added some others that may be just and reasonable, and make it a duty to take up arms; but to take them up for trifles and things to laugh at and be amused by rather than offended, looks as though he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) who did so was altogether wanting in common sense.
<p/>Moreover, to take an unjust revenge -LRB-and there cannot be any just one-RRB- is directly opposed to the sacred law that we acknowledge, wherein we are commanded to do good to our enemies and to love them that hate us;
<p/>a command which, though it seems somewhat difficult to obey, is only so to those who have in them less of God than of the world, and more of the flesh than of the spirit; for Jesus Christ, God and true man, who never lied, and could not and cannot lie, said, as our law-giver, that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) yoke was easy and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) burden light; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would not, therefore, have laid any command upon us that it was impossible to obey.
<p/>The devil take me,'' said Sancho to himself at this, ``but this master of mine is a theologian; or, if not, faith, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s as like one as one egg is like another.
<p/>Don Quixote stopped to take breath, and, observing that silence was still preserved, had a mind to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) discourse, and would have done so
<p/>had not Sancho interposed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) smartness; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master pause, took the lead, saying, <div class="bookquote">``My lord Don Quixote of La Mancha, who once was called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, but now is called the Knight of the Lions, is a gentleman of great discretion who knows Latin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) mother
<p/>tongue like a bachelor, and in everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) deals with or advises proceeds like a good soldier, and has all the laws and ordinances of what they call combat at his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) fingers' ends
<p/>; so you have nothing to do but to let yourselves be guided by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) says, and on my head be it if it is wrong.
<p/>Thus, sirs, you are bound to keep quiet by human and divine law.''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>'' '' Besides which, you have been told that it is folly to take offence at merely hearing a bray.
<p/>I remember when I was a boy I brayed as often as I had a fancy, without anyone hindering me, and so elegantly and naturally that when I brayed all the asses in the town would bray; but I was none the less for that the son of my parents who were greatly respected; and though I was envied because of the gift by more than one of the high and mighty ones of the town, I did not care two farthings for it; and that you may see I am telling the truth, wait a bit and listen, for this art, like swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;'' and then, taking hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) nose, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) began to bray so vigorously that all the valleys around rang again.
<p/>One of those, however, that stood near him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), fancying he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was mocking them, lifted up a long staff he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) such a blow with it that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground.
<p/>Don Quixote, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) so roughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance in hand, but so many thrust themselves between them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not avenge him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Far from it, finding a shower of stones rained upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and crossbows and muskets unnumbered levelled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wheeled Rocinante round and, as fast as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) best gallop could take him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), fled from the midst of them, commending himself to God with all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart to deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) out of this peril, in dread every step of some ball coming in at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) back and coming out at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breast, and every minute drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) breath to see whether it had gone from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>They put up Sancho, scarcely restored to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) senses, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) go after his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master; not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was sufficiently in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wits to guide the beast, but Dapple followed the footsteps of Rocinante, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not remain a moment separated.
<p/>Don Quixote having got some way off looked back, and seeing Sancho coming, waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) perceived that no one followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>The men of the troop stood their ground till night, and as the enemy did not come out to battle, they returned to their town exulting; and had they been aware of the ancient custom of the Greeks, they would have erected a trophy on the spot.
<p/>The members of the band, however, were satisfied with seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) take to flight, and did not fire on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>). CHAPTER XXVIII.
<p/>OF MATTERS THAT BENENGELI SAYS HE (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) WHO READS THEM WILL KNOW, IF HE (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) READS THEM WITH ATTENTION When the brave man flees, treachery is manifest and it is for wise men to reserve themselves for better occasions.
<p/>This proved to be the case with Don Quixote, who, giving way before the fury of the townsfolk and the hostile intentions of the angry troop, took to flight and, without a thought of Sancho or the danger in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), retreated to such a distance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thought made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) safe.
<p/>Sancho, lying across his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), as has been said, and at length came up, having by this time recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) senses, and on joining him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) let himself drop off Dapple at Rocinante's feet, sore, bruised, and belaboured.
<p/>Don Quixote dismounted to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wounds, but finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) whole from head to foot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), angrily enough, <div class="bookquote">``In an evil hour didst thou take to braying, Sancho!
<p/>Where hast thou learned that it is well done to mention the rope in the house of the man that has been hanged?
<p/>Give thanks to God, Sancho, that they signed the cross on thee just now with a stick, and did not mark thee per signum crucis with a cutlass.
<p/>I'm not equal to answering,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for I feel as if I was speaking through my shoulders; let us mount and get away from this; I'll keep from braying, but not from saying that knights-errant fly and leave their good squires to be pounded like privet, or made meal of at the hands of their enemies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) does not fly who retires,'' returned Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``for I would have thee know, Sancho, that the valour which is not based upon a foundation of prudence is called rashness, and the exploits of the rash man are to be attributed rather to good fortune than to courage; and so I own that I retired, but not that I fled; and therein I have followed the example of many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times; the histories are full of instances of this, but as it would not be any good to thee or pleasure to me, I will not recount them to thee now.
<p/>Sancho was by this time mounted with the help of Don Quixote, who then himself mounted Rocinante, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to take shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off.
<p/>Every now and then Sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans, and on Don Quixote asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what caused such acute suffering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) replied that, from the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back-bone up to the nape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) neck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was so sore that it nearly drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) senses.
<p/>The cause of that soreness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``will be, no doubt, that the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very long one, it caught thee all down the back, where all the parts that are sore are situated, and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``your worship has relieved me of a great doubt, and cleared up the point for me in elegant style!
<p/>Body o' me! is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am sore everywhere
<p/>To the music of brays what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' the staff hit me?
<p/>If it was my ankles that pained me there might be something in going divining why they did, but it is not much to divine that I'm sore where they thrashed me.
<p/>By my faith, master mine, the ills of others hang by a hair; every day I am discovering more and more how little I have to hope for from keeping company with your worship; for if this time you have allowed me to be drubbed, the next time, or a hundred times more, we'll have the blanketings of the other day over again, and all the other pranks which, if they have fallen on my shoulders now, will be thrown in my teeth by-and-by.
<p/>-LRB-if I was not an ignorant brute that will never do any good all my life-RRB-, I would do a great deal better, I say, to go home to my wife and children and support them and bring them up on what God may please to give me, instead of following your worship along roads that lead nowhere and paths that are none at all, with little to drink and less to eat.
<p/>Measure out seven feet on the earth, brother squire, and if that's not enough for you, take as many more, for you may have it all your own way and stretch yourself to your heart's content.
<p/>Oh that I could see burnt and turned to ashes the first man that meddled with knight-errantry or at any rate the first who chose to be squire to such fools as all the knights-errant of past times must have been!
<p/>Of those of the present day I say nothing, because, as your worship is one of them, I respect them, and because I know your worship knows a point more than the devil in all you say and think.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would lay a good wager with you, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``that now that you are talking on without anyone to stop you, you don't feel a pain in your whole body.
<p/>Talk away, my son, say whatever comes into your head or mouth, for so long as you feel no pain, the irritation your impertinences give me will be a pleasure to me; and if you are so anxious to go home to your wife and children, God forbid that I should prevent you; you have money of mine; see how long it is since we left our village this third time, and how much you can and ought to earn every month, and pay yourself out of your own hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I worked for Tom Carrasco, the father of the bachelor Samson Carrasco that your worship knows,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, ``I used to earn two ducats a month besides my food; I can't tell what I can earn with your worship, though I know a knight-errant's squire has harder times of it than he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) who works for a farmer; for after all, we who work for farmers, however much we toil all day, at the worst, at night, we have our olla supper and sleep in a bed, which I have not slept in since I have been in your worship's service, if it wasn't the short time we were in Don Diego de Miranda's house, and the feast I had with the skimmings I took off Camacho's pots, and what I ate, drank, and slept in Basilio's house; all the rest of the time I have been sleeping on the hard ground under the open sky, exposed to what they call the inclemencies of heaven, keeping life in me with scraps of cheese and crusts of bread, and drinking water either from the brooks or from the springs we come to on these by-paths we travel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I own, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that all thou sayest is true; how much, thinkest thou, ought I to give thee over and above what Tom Carrasco gave thee?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``it is twenty-five days since we left our village, so reckon up, Sancho, according to the wages you have made out for yourself, and see how much I owe you in proportion, and pay yourself, as I said before, out of your own hand.''

<p/>Don Quixote gave himself a great slap on the forehead and began to laugh heartily, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Why, I have not been wandering, either in the Sierra Morena or in the whole course of our sallies, but barely two months, and thou sayest, Sancho, that it is twenty years since I promised thee the island.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If I remember rightly,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``it must be over twenty years, three days more or less.

<p/>If so, and if that be thy pleasure, I give it to thee now, once and for all, and much good may it do thee, for so long as I see myself rid of such a good-for-nothing squire I'll be glad to be left a pauper without a rap.
<p/>But tell me, thou perverter of the squirely rules of knight-errantry, where hast thou ever seen or read that any knight-errant's squire made terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) lord, `you must give me so much a month for serving you'?
<p/>Plunge, scoundrel, rogue, monster--for such I take thee to be--plunge, I say, into the mare magnum of their histories; and if thou shalt find that any squire ever said or thought what thou hast said now, I will let thee nail it on my forehead, and give me, over and above, four sound slaps in the face.
<p/>Turn the rein, or the halter, of thy Dapple, and begone home; for one single step further thou shalt not make in my company.
<p/>Now, when I was about to raise thee to such a position, that, in spite of thy wife, they would call thee `my lord,' thou art leaving me?
<p/>Thou art going now when I had a firm and fixed intention of making thee lord of the best island in the world?
<p/>O bread thanklessly received! O promises ill-bestowed! O man more beast than human being! Well, as thou thyself hast said before now, honey is not for the mouth of the ass.
<p/>; for I know it will come to its close before thou dost perceive or discern that thou art a beast.
<p/>Ass thou art, ass thou wilt be, and ass thou wilt end when the course of thy life is run ''
<p/>Sancho regarded Don Quixote earnestly while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) this rating, and was so touched by remorse that the tears came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes, and in a piteous and broken voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), ``Master mine, I confess that, to be a complete ass, all I want is a tail; if your worship will only fix one on to me, I'll look on it as rightly placed, and I'll serve you as an ass all the remaining days of my life.
<p/>Forgive me and have pity on my folly, and remember I know but little, and, if I talk much, it's more from infirmity than malice; but
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been surprised, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``if thou hadst not introduced some bit of a proverb into thy speech.
<p/>Well, well, I forgive thee, provided thou dost mend and not show thyself in future so fond of thine own interest, but try to be of good cheer and take heart, and encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment of my promises, which, by being delayed, does not become impossible.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who sins and mends commends himself to God.''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' Sancho said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would do so, and keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could.
<p/>They then entered the grove, and Don Quixote settled himself at the foot of an elm, and Sancho at that of a beech, for trees of this kind and others like them always have feet but no hands.
<p/>Sancho passed the night in pain, for with the evening dews the blow of the staff made itself felt all the more.
<p/>Don Quixote passed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) never-failing meditations; but, for all that, they had some winks of sleep, and with the appearance of daylight they pursued their journey in quest of the banks of the famous Ebro, where that befell them which will be told in the following chapter.
<p/>By stages as already described or left undescribed, two days after quitting the grove Don Quixote and Sancho reached the river Ebro, and
<p/>the sight of it was a great delight to Don Quixote as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) contemplated and gazed upon the charms of its banks, the clearness of its stream, the gentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters; and the pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Above all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) dwelt upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had seen in the cave of Montesinos; for though Master Pedro's ape had told him (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) that of those things part was true, part false, he (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) clung more to their truth than to their falsehood, the very reverse of Sancho, who held them all to be downright lies.
<p/>As they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat, without oars or any other gear, that lay at the water's edge tied to the stem of a tree growing on the bank.
<p/>Don Quixote looked all round, and seeing nobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from Rocinante and bade Sancho get down from Dapple and tie both beasts securely to the trunk of a poplar or willow that stood there.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIX. OF THE FAMOUS ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED BARK Sancho asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the reason of this sudden dismounting and tying.
<p/>Don Quixote made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Thou must know, Sancho, that this bark is plainly, and without the possibility of any alternative, calling and inviting me to enter it, and in it go to give aid to some knight or other person of distinction in need of it, who is no doubt in some sore strait; for this is the way of the books of chivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak in them.
<p/>When a knight is involved in some difficulty from which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) cannot be delivered save by the hand of another knight, though they may be at a distance of two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other, they either take him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) up on a cloud, or they provide a bark for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to get into, and in less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) where they will and where his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) help is required; and so, Sancho, this bark is placed here for the same purpose; this is as true as that it is now day, and ere this one passes tie Dapple and Rocinante together, and then in God's hand be it to guide us; for I would not hold back from embarking, though barefooted friars were to beg me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't know if I may call them absurdities--at every turn, there's nothing for it but to obey and bow the head, bearing in mind the proverb, `Do as thy master bids thee, and sit down to table with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>);' but for all that, for the sake of easing my conscience, I warn your worship that it is my opinion this bark is no enchanted one, but belongs to some of the fishermen of the river, for they catch the best shad in the world here.
<p/>As Sancho said this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tied the beasts, leaving them to the care and protection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Don Quixote bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) not be uneasy about deserting the animals, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who would carry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions would take care to feed them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' As that's the case,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and your worship chooses to give in to these-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand that logiquous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``nor have I ever heard the word all the days of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``cross ourselves and weigh anchor; I mean, embark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and the bark began to drift away slowly from the bank.
<p/>But when Sancho saw himself somewhere about two yards out in the river, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) began to tremble and give himself up for lost; but nothing distressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) more than hearing Dapple bray and seeing Rocinante struggling to get loose, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, ``Dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and Rocinante is trying to escape and plunge in after us.
<p/>O dear friends, peace be with you, and may this madness that is taking us away from you, turned into sober sense, bring us back to you.
<p/>And with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fell weeping so bitterly, that Don Quixote said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), sharply and angrily, ``What art thou afraid of, cowardly creature?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now they are tied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``what are we to do next?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' What art thou weeping at, heart of butter-paste?
<p/>Who pursues or molests thee, thou soul of a tame mouse? What dost thou want, unsatisfied in the very heart of abundance?
<p/>Art thou, perchance, tramping barefoot over the Riphaean mountains, instead of being seated on a bench like an archduke on the tranquil stream of this pleasant river, from which in a short space we shall come out upon the broad sea?
<p/>But we must have already emerged and gone seven hundred or eight hundred leagues; and if I had here an astrolabe to take the altitude of the pole, I could tell thee how many we have travelled, though either I know little, or we have already crossed or shall shortly cross the equinoctial line which parts the two opposite poles midway.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for of the three hundred and sixty degrees that this terraqueous globe contains, as computed by Ptolemy, the greatest cosmographer known, we shall have travelled one-half when we come to the line I spoke of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``your worship gives me a nice authority for what you say, putrid Dolly something transmogrified, or whatever it is.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>And when we come to that line your worship speaks of,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``how far shall we have gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Don Quixote laughed at the interpretation Sancho put upon <div class="bookquote">``computed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and the name of the cosmographer Ptolemy, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ptolemy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Thou must know, Sancho, that with the Spaniards and those who embark at Cadiz for the East Indies, one of the signs they have to show them when they have passed the equinoctial line I told thee of, is, that the lice die upon everybody on board the ship, and not a single one is left, or to be found in the whole vessel if they gave its weight in gold for it; so, Sancho, thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh, and if thou comest upon anything alive we shall be no longer in doubt; if not, then we have crossed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``still, I'll do as your worship bids me; though I don't know what need there is for trying these experiments, for I can see with my own eyes that we have not moved five yards away from the bank, or shifted two yards from where the animals stand, for there are Rocinante and Dapple in the very same place where we left them; and watching a point, as I do now, I swear by all that's good, we are not stirring or moving at the pace of an ant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try the test I told thee of, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``and don't mind any other, for thou knowest nothing about colures, lines, parallels, zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices, equinoxes, planets, signs, bearings, the measures of which the celestial and terrestrial spheres are composed; if thou wert acquainted with all these things, or any portion of them, thou wouldst see clearly how many parallels we have cut, what signs we have seen, and what constellations we have left behind and are now leaving behind.
<p/>But again I tell thee, feel and hunt, for I am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white paper.
<p/>Sancho felt, and passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand gently and carefully down to the hollow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) left knee, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) looked up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master and said, ``Either the test is a false one, or we have not come to where your worship says, nor within many leagues of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and aughts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho; and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) whole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding in midstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter, but simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle.
<p/>They now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the middle of the river, and the instant Don Quixote saw them he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cried out, ``Seest thou there, my friend?
<p/>there stands the castle or fortress, where there is, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, or infanta, or princess, in whose aid I am brought hither.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talking about, senor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``don't you see that those are mills that stand in the river to grind corn?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold thy peace, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``though they look like mills they are not so; I have already told thee that enchantments transform things and change their proper shapes; I do not mean to say they really change them from one form into another, but that it seems as though they did, as experience proved in the transformation of Dulcinea, sole refuge of my hopes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, how so? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>asked Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``hast thou come upon aught?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' By this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, began to move less slowly than hitherto.
<p/>The millers belonging to the mills, when they saw the boat coming down the river, and on the point of being sucked in by the draught of the wheels, ran out in haste, several of them, with long poles to stop it, and being all mealy, with faces and garments covered with flour, they presented a sinister appearance.
<p/>They raised loud shouts, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Devils of men, where are you going to? Are you mad? Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among these wheels?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Did I not tell thee, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote at this, ``that we had reached the place where I am to show what the might of my arm can do?
<p/>See what ruffians and villains come out against me; see what monsters oppose me; see what hideous countenances come to frighten us!
<p/>And then standing up in the boat he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began in a loud voice to hurl threats at the millers, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Ill-conditioned and worse-counselled rabble, restore to liberty and freedom the person ye hold in durance in this your fortress or prison, high or low or of
<p/>whatever rank or quality he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) be, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the Lions, for whom, by the disposition of heaven above, it is reserved to give a happy issue to this adventure;
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the millers</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) sword and began making passes in the air at the millers, who, hearing but not understanding all this nonsense, strove to stop the boat, which was now getting into the rushing channel of the wheels.
<p/>Sancho fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees devoutly appealing to heaven to deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) from such imminent peril; which it did by the activity and quickness of the millers, who, pushing against the boat with their poles, stopped it, not, however, without upsetting and throwing Don Quixote and Sancho into the water; and lucky it was for Don Quixote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could swim like a goose, though the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) twice to the bottom; and had it not been for the millers, who plunged in and hoisted them both out, it would have been Troy town with the pair of them.
<p/>As soon as, more drenched than thirsty, they were landed, Sancho went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven, prayed a long and fervent prayer to God to deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) evermore from the rash projects and attempts of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) master.
<p/>The fishermen, the owners of the boat, which the mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and seeing it smashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment for it from Don Quixote; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with great calmness, just as if nothing had happened him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), told the millers and fishermen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would pay for the bark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), free and unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that castle of theirs.
<p/>'' You shall soon see, scoundrels!'' '' What persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman? Art thou for carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills?''
<p/>That's enough,'' said Don Quixote to himself, ``it would be preaching in the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble to do any virtuous action.
<p/>In this adventure two mighty enchanters must have encountered one another, and one frustrates what the other attempts; one provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God help us, this world is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one with the other.
<p/>And then turning towards the mills he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said aloud, ``Friends, whoe'er ye be that are immured in that prison, forgive me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you from your misery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and destined for some other knight.
<p/>So saying he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) settled with the fishermen, and paid fifty reals for the boat, which Sancho handed to them very much against the grain, saying, <div class="bookquote">``With a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk our whole capital.
<p/>The fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two figures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, and were wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and questions Don Quixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion that they were madmen, they left them and betook themselves, the millers to their mills, and the fishermen to their huts.
<p/>Don Quixote and Sancho returned to their beasts, and to their life of beasts, and so ended the adventure of the enchanted bark.
<p/>They reached their beasts in low spirits and bad humour enough, knight and squire, Sancho particularly, for with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) what touched the stock of money touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart, and when any was taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was robbed of the apples of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>In fine, without exchanging a word, they mounted and quitted the famous river, Don Quixote absorbed in thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) love,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>I can do no more. '' '' '' CHAPTER XXX. OF DON QUIXOTE'S ADVENTURE WITH A FAIR HUNTRESS Sancho in thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) advancement, which just then, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>)
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was very far from securing; for, fool as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) saw clearly enough that his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) master's acts were all or most of them utterly senseless; and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) began to cast about for an opportunity of retiring from his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) service and going home some day, without entering into any explanations or taking any farewell of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).
<p/>It so happened that the next day towards sunset, on coming out of a wood, Don Quixote cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes over a green meadow, and at the far end of it observed some people, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) drew nearer saw that it was a hawking party.
<p/>Coming closer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) distinguished among them a lady of graceful mien, on a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned with green trappings and a silver-mounted side-saddle.
<p/>Fortune, however, ordered matters after a fashion very much the opposite of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) contemplated. The lady was also in green, and so richly and splendidly dressed that splendour itself seemed personified in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left hand she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bore a hawk, a proof to Don Quixote's mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be some great lady and the mistress of the whole hunting party, which was the fact; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Run Sancho, my son, and say to that lady on the palfrey with the hawk that I, the Knight of the Lions, kiss the hands of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) exalted beauty, and if her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) excellence will grant me leave I will go and kiss them in person and place myself at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) service for aught that may be in my power and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) highness may command; and mind, Sancho, how thou speakest, and take care not to thrust in any of thy proverbs into thy message.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' You've got a likely one here to thrust any in!'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``leave me alone for that! Why, this is not the first time in my life I have carried messages to high and exalted ladies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Except that thou didst carry to the lady Dulcinea,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I know not that thou hast carried any other, at least in my service.
<p/>That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``but pledges don't distress a good payer, and in a house where there's plenty supper is soon cooked; I mean there's no need of telling or warning me about anything; for I'm ready for everything and know a little of everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' That I believe, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote; ``go and good luck to thee, and God speed thee.
<p/>Sancho went off at top speed, forcing Dapple out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) regular pace, and came to where the fair huntress was standing, and dismounting knelt before her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Fair lady, that knight that you see there, the Knight of the Lions by name, is my master, and I am a squire of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), and at home they call me Sancho Panza.
<p/>This same Knight of the Lions, who was called not long since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, sends by me to say may it please your highness to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) leave that, with your permission, approbation, and consent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) may come and carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) wishes, which are, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) says and
<p/>I believe, to serve your exalted loftiness and beauty; and if you give it, your ladyship will do a thing which will redound to your honour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) will receive a most distinguished favour and happiness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the huntress</b></font>)</div><p/>You have indeed, squire,'' said the lady, ``delivered your message with all the formalities such messages require; rise up, for it is not right that the squire of a knight so great as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of the Rueful Countenance, of whom we have heard a great deal here, should remain on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) knees; rise, my friend, and bid your master welcome to the services of myself and the duke my husband, in a country house we have here.
<p/>Sancho got up, charmed as much by the beauty of the good lady as by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) high-bred air and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) courtesy, but, above all, by what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had said about having heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance; for if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not call him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) Knight of the Lions
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, brother squire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lions/Knight of the Lions/LIONS</b></font>)</div>asked the duchess -LRB-whose title, however, is not known-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``this master of yours, is he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) not one of whom there is a history extant in print, called `The Ingenious Gentleman, Don Quixote of La Mancha,' who has for the lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart a certain Dulcinea del Toboso?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is the same, senora,'' replied Sancho; ``and that squire of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) who figures, or ought to figure, in the said history under the name of Sancho Panza, is myself, unless they have changed me in the cradle, I mean in the press.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am rejoiced at all this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess; ``go, brother Panza, and tell your master that he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) is welcome to my estate, and that nothing could happen to me that could give me greater pleasure.
<p/>Sancho returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master mightily pleased with this gratifying answer, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) all the great lady had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), lauding to the skies, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) rustic phrase, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rare beauty, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) graceful gaiety, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) courtesy.
<p/>Don Quixote drew himself up briskly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saddle, fixed himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stirrups, settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) visor, gave Rocinante the spur, and with an easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess, who, having sent to summon the duke her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) husband, told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) while Don Quixote was approaching all about the message; and as both of them had read the First Part of this history, and from it were aware of Don Quixote's crazy turn, they awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with the greatest delight and anxiety to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) acquaintance, meaning to fall in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) humour and agree with everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, and, so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stayed with them, to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as a knight-errant, with all the ceremonies usual in the books of chivalry they had read, for they themselves were very fond of them.
<p/>Don Quixote now came up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) visor raised, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seemed about to dismount Sancho made haste to go and hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stirrup for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but in getting down off Dapple he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was so unlucky as to hitch his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) foot in one of the ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was unable to free it, and was left hanging by it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) face and breast on the ground.
<p/>Don Quixote, who was not used to dismount without having the stirrup held, fancying that Sancho had by this time come to hold it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), threw himself off with a lurch and brought Rocinante's saddle after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), which was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) both came to the ground; not without discomfiture to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and abundant curses muttered between his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) teeth against the unlucky Sancho, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) foot still in the shackles.
<p/>The duke ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) huntsmen to go to the help of knight and squire, and they raised Don Quixote, sorely shaken by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fall; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), limping, advanced as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could to kneel before the noble pair.
<p/>This, however, the duke would by no means permit; on the contrary, dismounting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went and embraced Don Quixote, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I am grieved, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, that your first experience on my ground should have been such an unfortunate one as we have seen; but the carelessness of squires is often the cause of worse accidents.
<p/>That which has happened me in meeting you, mighty prince,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``cannot be unfortunate, even if my fall had not stopped short of the depths of the bottomless pit, for the glory of having seen you would have lifted me up and delivered me from it.

<p/>Sancho, by this time released from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) entanglement, was standing by, and before his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master could answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, ``There is no denying, and it must be maintained, that my lady Dulcinea del Toboso is very beautiful; but the hare jumps up where one least expects it; and I have heard say that what we call nature is like a potter that makes vessels of clay, and he (<font color='blue'><b>potter</b></font>) who makes one fair vessel can as well make two, or three, or a hundred; I say so because, by my faith, my lady the duchess is in no way behind my mistress the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>Don Quixote turned to the duchess and said, ``Your highness may conceive that never had knight-errant in this world a more talkative or a droller squire than I have, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will prove the truth of what I say, if your highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days.
<p/>To which the duchess made answer, <div class="bookquote">``that worthy Sancho is droll I consider a very good thing, because it is a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is shrewd; for drollery and sprightliness, Senor Don Quixote, as you very well know, do not take up their abode with dull wits; and as good Sancho is droll and sprightly I here set him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) down as shrewd.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/>So much the better,'' said the duke, <div class="bookquote">``for many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance-''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' And talkative,'' added Don Quixote. '' <div class="bookquote">``Of the Lions, your highness must say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``for there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of the Lions be it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>continued the duke; <div class="bookquote">``I say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) shall be given that reception which is due to
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.
<p/>By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante's saddle, and Don Quixote having got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle.
<p/>'' The duchess desired Sancho to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) side, for she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) found infinite enjoyment in listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shrewd remarks.
<p/>Sancho required no pressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle.
<p/>WHICH TREATS OF MANY AND GREAT MATTERS Supreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as it seemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) looked forward to finding in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) castle what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had found in Don Diego's house and in Basilio's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) was always fond of good living, and always seized by the forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented itself.
<p/>The history informs us, then, that before they reached the country house or castle, the duke went on in advance and instructed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Basilio</b></font>) servants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and so the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) came up to the castle gates with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries, clad in what they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to their feet, hastened out, and catching Don Quixote in their arms before he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw or heard them, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``Your highness should go and take my lady the duchess off her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) horse.
<p/>Don Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between the two over the matter; but in the end the duchess's determination carried the day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) refused to get down or dismount from her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) palfrey except in the arms of the duke, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) did not consider herself worthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight.
<p/>At length the duke came out to take her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) down, and as they entered a spacious court two fair damsels came forward and threw over Don Quixote's shoulders a large mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all the galleries of the court were lined with the men-servants and women-servants of the household, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Welcome, flower and cream of knight-errantry!''  (<font color='red'><b>women-servants</b></font>)</div>while all or most of them flung pellets filled with scented water over Don Quixote and the duke and duchess; at all which Don Quixote was greatly astonished, and this was the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in reality and not merely in fancy, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw himself treated in the same way as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had read of such knights being treated in days of yore.
<p/>Sancho, deserting Dapple, hung on to the duchess and entered the castle, but feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the ass alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) approached a respectable duenna who had come out with the rest to receive the duchess, and in a low voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), ``Senora Gonzalez, or however your grace may be called-
<p/>To which Sancho made answer, <div class="bookquote">``I should be glad if your worship would do me the favour to go out to the castle gate, where you will find a grey ass of mine; make them, if you please, put him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in the stable, or put him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) there yourself, for the poor little beast is rather easily frightened, and cannot bear being alone at all.''

<p/>Be off with you, brother, and bad luck to you and him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) who brought you here; go, look after your ass, for we, the duennas of this house, are not used to work of that sort.''
<p/>Well then, in troth,'' returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I have heard my master, who is the very treasure-finder of stories, telling the story of Lancelot when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came from Britain, say that ladies waited upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and duennas upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hack; and, if it comes to my ass, I wouldn't change him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) for Senor Lancelot's hack.
<p/>If the master is as wise as the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said the duenna, <div class="bookquote">``we have got a fine bargain. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the duenna</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>If you are a jester, brother,'' said the duenna, <div class="bookquote">``keep your drolleries for some place where they'll pass muster and be paid for; for you'll get nothing from me but a fig.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Son of a bitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duenna</b></font>)</div>said the duenna, all aglow with anger, <div class="bookquote">``whether I'm old or not, it's with God I have to reckon, not with you, you garlic-stuffed scoundrel!
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) said it so loud, that the duchess heard it, and turning round and seeing the duenna in such a state of excitement, and her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) eyes flaming so, asked whom she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was wrangling with.

 (<font color='red'><b>the duenna</b></font>)</div><p/>That,'' said the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``I should have considered the greatest affront that could be offered me;''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>and addressing Sancho, she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), ``You must know, friend Sancho, that Dona Rodriguez is very youthful, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) wears that hood more for authority and custom's sake than because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) years.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``May all the rest of mine be unlucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``if I meant it that way; I only spoke because the affection I have for my ass is so great, and I thought I could not commend him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to a more kind-hearted person than the lady Dona Rodriguez.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' Don Quixote, who was listening, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Is this proper conversation for the place, Sancho?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, ``every one must mention what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wants wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) may be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) here; if I had thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in the stable I would have spoken there.
<p/>On which the duke observed, ``Sancho is quite right, and there is no reason at all to find fault with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); Dapple shall be fed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart's content, and Sancho may rest easy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shall be treated like himself.
<p/>While this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, was proceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into a chamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour and waited on him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) like pages, all of them prepared and instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and how they were to treat Don Quixote, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might see and believe they were treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) like a knight-errant.
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour was removed, there stood Don Quixote in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) tight-fitting breeches and chamois doublet, lean, lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to be kissing each other inside; such a figure, that if the damsels waiting on him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had not taken care to check their merriment -LRB-which was one of the particular directions their master and mistress had given them-RRB-, they would have burst with laughter.
<p/>They asked him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to let himself be stripped that they might put a shirt on him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would not on any account, saying that modesty became knights-errant just as much as valour.
<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said they might give the shirt to Sancho; and shutting himself in with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in a room where there was a sumptuous bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) undressed and put on the shirt; and then, finding himself alone with Sancho, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, thou new-fledged buffoon and old booby, dost thou think it right to offend and insult a duenna so deserving of reverence and respect as that one just now?
<p/>Was that a time to bethink thee of thy Dapple, or are these noble personages likely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat their owners in such elegant style?
<p/>For God's sake, Sancho, restrain thyself, and don't show the thread so as to let them see what a coarse, boorish texture thou art of.
<p/>Remember, sinner that thou art, the master is the more esteemed the more respectable and well-bred his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) servants are; and that one of the greatest advantages that princes have over other men is that they have servants as good as themselves to wait on them.
<p/>if they perceive thee to be a coarse clown or a dull blockhead, they will suspect me to be some impostor or swindler?
<p/>Sancho friend, keep clear, oh, keep clear of these stumbling-blocks; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who falls into the way of being a chatterbox and droll, drops into a wretched buffoon the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) trips; bridle thy tongue, consider and weigh thy words before they escape thy mouth, and bear in mind we are now in quarters whence, by God's help, and the strength of my arm, we shall come forth mightily advanced in fame and fortune.
<p/>Sancho promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with much earnestness to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mouth shut, and to bite off his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tongue before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) uttered a word that was not altogether to the purpose and well considered, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might make his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mind easy on that point, for it should never be discovered through him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) what they were.
<p/>Don Quixote dressed himself, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) baldric with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword, threw the scarlet mantle over his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shoulders, placed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head a montera of green satin that the damsels had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and thus arrayed passed out into the large room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found the damsels drawn up in double file, the same number on each side, all with the appliances for washing the hands, which they presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with profuse obeisances and ceremonies.
<p/>Then came twelve pages, together with the seneschal, to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to dinner, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hosts were already waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>They placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the midst of them, and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) into another room, where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers.
<p/>The duchess and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and with them a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who rule noblemen's houses; one of those who, not being born magnates themselves, never know how to teach those who are how to behave as such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when they try to introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it into meanness.
<p/>One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote.
<p/>A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table.
<p/>The duke pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had to accept it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Dost thou not see--shortsighted being that thou art, and unlucky mortal that I am!--that Nay, nay, '' The ecclesiastic took his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and the duke and duchess those at the sides.
<p/>All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement at the honour he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw shown to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master by these illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seat at the head of the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, ``If your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.
<p/>Sancho glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and guessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thoughts, said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid of my going astray, senor, or saying anything that won't be pat to the purpose; I haven't forgotten the advice your worship gave me just now about talking much or little, well or ill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was about to say something foolish. <div class="bookquote">``I have no recollection of anything, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``say
<p/>Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``what I am going to say is so true that my master Don Quixote, who is here present, will keep me from lying.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lie as much as thou wilt for all I care, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for I am not going to stop thee, but consider what thou art going to say.
<p/>I have so considered and reconsidered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``that the bell-ringer's in a safe berth; as will be seen by what follows.

<p/>what thou wilt, only say it quickly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' As you live, say so, that these gentlefolk may not take me for some lying chatterer.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So far,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the ecclesiastic, <div class="bookquote">``I take you to be more a chatterer than a liar; but I don't know what I shall take you for by-and-by.''
 (<font color='red'><b>witnesses proofs Sancho</b></font>)</div><p/>Thou citest so many witnesses and proofs, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that I have no choice but to say thou must be telling the truth; go on, and cut the story short, for thou art taking the way not to make an end for two days to come.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is not to cut it short,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the duchess; <div class="bookquote">``on the contrary, for my gratification, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is to tell it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knows it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should not finish it these six days; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took so many they would be to me the pleasantest I ever spent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/>Well then, sirs, I say,'' continued Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that this same gentleman, whom I know as well as I do my own hands, for it's not a bowshot from my house to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), invited a poor but respectable labourer-

<p/>So, as I was saying,'' continued Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``as the pair of them were going to sit down to table, as I said, the labourer insisted upon the gentleman's taking the head of the table, and the gentleman insisted upon the labourer's taking it, as his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) orders should be obeyed in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) house; but the labourer, who plumed himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) politeness and good breeding, would not on any account, until the gentleman, out of patience, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shoulders, compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) by force to sit down, saying, `Sit down, you stupid lout, for wherever I sit will be the head to you; and that's the story, and, troth

<p/>The duke and duchess suppressed their laughter so as not altogether to mortify Don Quixote, for they saw through Sancho's impertinence; and to change the conversation, and keep Sancho from uttering more absurdities, the duchess asked Don Quixote what news he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had of the lady Dulcinea, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) any presents of giants or miscreants lately, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not but have vanquished a good many.
<p/>I have vanquished giants and I have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) caitiffs and miscreants; but where are they to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) is enchanted and turned into the most ill-favoured peasant wench that can be imagined?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho Panza; ``to me she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) seems the fairest creature in the world; at any rate, in nimbleness and jumping she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) won't give in to a tumbler; by my faith, senora duchess, she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) leaps from the ground on to the back of an ass like a cat.
<p/>To which Don Quixote replied, <div class="bookquote">``Senora, my misfortunes, though they had a beginning, will never have an end.

<p/>'' What, seen her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)!'' said Sancho; ``why, who the devil was it but myself that first thought of the enchantment business?
<p/>The ecclesiastic, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and enchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose story the duke was always reading; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had himself often reproved him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for it, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) it was foolish to read such fooleries; and becoming convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) suspicion was correct, addressing the duke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said very angrily to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Senor, your excellence will have to give account to God for what this good man does.

''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Then turning to address Don Quixote he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, ``And you, num-skull, who put it into your head that you are a knight-errant, and vanquish giants and capture miscreants?
<p/>Go home and bring up your children if you have any, and attend to your business, and give over going wandering about the world, gaping and making a laughing-stock of yourself to all who know you and all who don't.
<p/>Go your ways in a good hour, and in a good hour be it said to you. Where, in heaven's name, have you discovered that there are or ever were knights-errant?
<p/>Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La Mancha, or enchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they tell about you?
<p/>Don Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman's words, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) perceived he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had done speaking, regardless of the presence of the duke and duchess, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet with angry looks and an agitated countenance, and said--
<p/>WITH OTHER INCIDENTS, GRAVE AND DROLL Don Quixote, then, having risen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet, trembling from head to foot like a man dosed with mercury, said in a hurried, agitated voice,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The place I am in, the presence in which I stand, and the respect I have and always have had for the profession to which your worship belongs, hold and bind the hands of my just indignation; and as well for these reasons as because I know, as everyone knows, that a gownsman's weapon is the same as a woman's, the tongue, I will with mine engage in equal combat with your worship, from whom one might have expected good advice instead of foul abuse.
<p/>Pious, well-meant reproof requires a different demeanour and arguments of another sort; at any rate, to have reproved me in public, and so roughly, exceeds the bounds of proper reproof, for that comes better with gentleness than with rudeness; and it is not seemly to call the sinner roundly blockhead and booby, without knowing anything of the sin that is reproved.
<p/>Come, tell me, for which of the stupidities you have observed in me do you condemn and abuse me, and bid me go home and look after my house and wife and children, without knowing whether I have any?
<p/>Is nothing more needed than to get a footing, by hook or by crook, in other people's houses to rule over the masters -LRB-and that, perhaps, after having been brought up in all the straitness of some seminary, and without having ever seen more of the world than may lie within twenty or thirty leagues round-RRB-, to fit one to lay down the law rashly for chivalry, and pass judgment on knights-errant?
<p/>Is it, haply, an idle occupation, or is the time ill-spent that is spent in roaming the world in quest, not of its enjoyments,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>But the reply deserves a chapter to itself. CHAPTER XXXII. OF THE REPLY DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) CENSURER, but of those arduous toils whereby the good mount upwards to the abodes of everlasting life?
<p/>If gentlemen, great lords, nobles, men of high birth, were to rate me as a fool I should take it as an irreparable insult; but I care not a farthing if clerks who have never entered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish.
<p/>Some take the broad road of overweening ambition; others that of mean and servile flattery; others that of deceitful hypocrisy, and some that of true religion; but I, led by my star, follow the narrow path of knight-errantry, and in pursuit of that calling I despise wealth, but not honour.
<p/>I have redressed injuries, righted wrongs, punished insolences, vanquished giants, and crushed monsters; I am in love, for no other reason than that it is incumbent on knights-errant to be so; but though I am, I am no carnal-minded lover, but one of the chaste, platonic sort.
<p/>My intentions are always directed to worthy ends, to do good to all and evil to none; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) who means this, does this, and makes this his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) practice deserves to be called a fool, it is for your highnesses to say, O most excellent duke and duchess.''
<p/>Knight I am, and knight I will die, if such be the pleasure of the Most High. '' Good, by God!
<p/>'' cried Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``say no more in your own defence, master mine, for there's nothing more in the world to be said, thought, or insisted on; and besides, when this gentleman denies, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has, that there are or ever have been any knights-errant in the world, is it any wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows nothing of what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been talking about?''

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' No, Sancho my friend, certainly not,'' said the duke, <div class="bookquote">``for in the name of Senor Don Quixote I confer upon you the government of one of no small importance that I have at my disposal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go down on thy knees, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``and kiss the feet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) excellence for the favour he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has bestowed upon thee.
<p/>Sancho obeyed, and on seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from table completely out of temper, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``By the gown I wear, I am almost inclined to say that your excellence is as great a fool as these sinners.
<p/>I leave your excellence with them, for so long as they are in the house, I will remain in my own, and spare myself the trouble of reproving what I cannot remedy;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and without uttering another word, or eating another morsel, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) went off, the entreaties of the duke and duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>); not that the duke said much to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could not, because of the laughter his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) uncalled-for anger provoked.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had done laughing, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said to Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``You have replied on your own behalf so stoutly, Sir Knight of the Lions, that there is no occasion to seek further satisfaction for this, which, though it may look like an offence, is not so at all, for, as women can give no offence,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>No wonder they are mad, when people who are in their senses sanction their madness! no more can ecclesiastics, as you very well know.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``and the reason is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who is not liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone.
<p/>Women, children, and ecclesiastics, as they cannot defend themselves, though they may receive offence cannot be insulted, because between the offence and the insult there is, as your excellence very well knows, this difference: the insult comes from one who is capable of offering it, and does so, and maintains it; the offence may come from any quarter without carrying insult.
<p/>To take an example: a man is standing unsuspectingly in the street and ten others come up armed and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) draws his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sword and quits himself like a man, but the number of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) antagonists makes it impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to effect his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purpose and avenge himself; this man suffers an offence but not an insult.
<p/>Another example will make the same thing plain: a man is standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back turned, another comes up and strikes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and after striking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes to flight, without waiting an instant, and the other pursues him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but does not overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who received the blow received an offence, but not an insult, because an insult must be maintained.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so sneakingly and treacherously, had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sword and stood and faced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who had been struck would have received offence and insult at the same time; offence because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was struck treacherously, insult because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) maintained what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done, standing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ground without taking to flight.
<p/>And so, according to the laws of the accursed duel, I may have received offence, but not insult, for neither women nor children can maintain it, nor can they wound, nor have they any way of standing their ground, and it is just the same with those connected with religion; for these three sorts of persons are without arms offensive or defensive, and so, though naturally they are bound to defend themselves, they have no right to offend anybody; and though I said just now I might have received offence, I say now certainly not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) who cannot receive an insult can still less give one; for which reasons I ought not to feel, nor do I feel, aggrieved at what that good man said to me
<p/>; I only wish he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had stayed a little longer, that I might have shown him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the mistake he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) makes in supposing and maintaining that there are not and never have been any knights-errant in the world; had Amadis or any of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countless descendants heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say as much, I am sure it would not have gone well with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worship.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take my oath of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``they would have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a slash that would have slit him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) down from top to toe like a pomegranate or a ripe melon; they were likely fellows to put up with jokes of that sort!
<p/>By my faith, I'm certain if Reinaldos of Montalvan had heard the little man's words he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) such a spank on the mouth that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't have spoken for the next three years; ay, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tackle them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll see how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll get out of their hands!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>The duchess, as she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) listened to Sancho, was ready to die with laughter, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) own mind she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) down as droller and madder than his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master; and there were a good many just then who were of the same opinion.
<p/>Don Quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as the cloth was removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silver basin, another with a jug also of silver, a third with two fine white towels on her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) shoulder, and the fourth with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) arms bared to the elbows, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) white hands -LRB-for white they certainly were-RRB- a round ball of Naples soap.
<p/>The one with the basin approached, and with arch composure and impudence, thrust it under Don Quixote's chin, who, wondering at such a ceremony, said never a word, supposing it to be the custom of that country to wash beards instead of hands; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) therefore stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) out as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could, and at the same instant the jug began to pour and the damsel with the soap rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) beard briskly, raising snow-flakes, for the soap lather was no less white, not only over the beard, but all over the face, and over the eyes of the submissive knight, so that they were perforce obliged to keep shut.
<p/>'' '' The duke and duchess, who had not known anything about this, waited to see what came of this strange washing.
<p/>The barber damsel, when she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) a hand's breadth deep in lather, pretended that there was no more water, and bade the one with the jug go and fetch some, while Senor Don Quixote waited.
<p/>All those present, and there were a good many, were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and as they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) there with half a yard of neck, and that uncommonly brown, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes shut, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) beard full of soap, it was a great wonder, and only by great discretion, that they were able to restrain their laughter.
<p/>The damsels, the concocters of the joke, kept their eyes down, not daring to look at their master and mistress; and as for them, laughter and anger struggled within them, and they knew not what to do, whether to punish the audacity of the girls, or to reward them for the amusement they had received from seeing Don Quixote in such a plight.
<p/>At length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end of washing Don Quixote, and the one who carried the towels very deliberately wiped him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and dried him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); and all four together making him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a profound obeisance and curtsey, they were about to go, when the duke, lest Don Quixote should see through the joke, called out to the one with the basin saying, ``Come and wash me, and take care that there is water enough.
<p/>The girl, sharp-witted and prompt, came and placed the basin for the duke as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had done for Don Quixote, and they soon had him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) well soaped and washed, and having wiped him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) dry they made their obeisance and retired.
<p/>It appeared afterwards that the duke had sworn that if they had not washed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as they had Don Quixote he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have punished them for their impudence, which they adroitly atoned for by soaping him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as well.
<p/>Sancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``God bless me, if it were only the custom in this country to wash squires' beards too as well as knights'.
<p/>For by God and upon my soul I want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besides I'd take it as a still greater kindness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did so, and Don Quixote was left the strangest and most ludicrous figure that could be imagined. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>I was saying, senora,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``that in the courts of other princes, when the cloth is taken away, I have always heard say they give water for the hands, but not lye for the beard; and that shows it is good to live long that you may see much; to be sure, they say too that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who lives a long life must undergo much evil, though to undergo a washing of that sort is pleasure rather than pain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be uneasy, friend Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess; <div class="bookquote">``I will take care that my damsels wash you, and even put you in the tub if necessary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be content with the beard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``at any rate for the present; and as for the future, God has decreed what is to be.
<p/>What are you saying to yourself, Sancho? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>asked the duchess. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Attend to worthy Sancho's request, seneschal,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, ``and do exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wishes.
<p/>The seneschal replied that Senor Sancho should be obeyed in everything; and with that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), while the duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussing a great variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and knight-errantry.
<p/>The duchess begged Don Quixote, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seemed to have a retentive memory, to describe and portray to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) the beauty and features of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) must be the fairest creature in the world, nay, in all La Mancha.
<p/>Don Quixote sighed on hearing the duchess's request, and said, <div class="bookquote">``If I could pluck out my heart, and lay it on a plate on this table here before your highness's eyes, it would spare my tongue the pain of telling what can hardly be thought of, for in it your excellence would see her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) portrayed in full.
<p/>But why should I attempt to depict and describe in detail, and feature by feature, the beauty of the peerless Dulcinea, the burden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine, an enterprise wherein the pencils of Parrhasius, Timantes, and Apelles, and the graver of Lysippus ought to be employed, to paint it in pictures and carve it in marble and bronze, and Ciceronian and Demosthenian eloquence to sound its praises?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does Demosthenian mean, Senor Don Quixote?''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess; <div class="bookquote">``it is a word I never heard in all my life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Demosthenian eloquence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``means the eloquence of Demosthenes, as Ciceronian means that of Cicero, who were the two most eloquent orators in the world.
<p/>Nevertheless, Senor Don Quixote would greatly gratify us if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would depict her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) to us; for never fear, even in an outline or sketch she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) will be something to make the fairest envious.''

<p/>For your highnesses must know that, going a few days back to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) hands and receive her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) benediction, approbation, and permission for this third sally, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) altogether a different being from the one I sought; I found her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) enchanted and changed from a princess into a peasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil, from fragrant to pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a dignified lady into a jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from Dulcinea del Toboso into a coarse Sayago wench.

<p/>Enchanters have persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, and enchanters will continue to persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry in the deep abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me where they know I feel it most.
<p/>For to deprive a knight-errant of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) lady is to deprive him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) of the eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sees with, of the sun that gives him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) light, of the food whereby he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) lives.
<p/>have I said it, and I say it now once more, a knight-errant without a lady is like a tree without leaves, a building without a foundation, or a shadow without the body that causes it.
<p/>There is no denying it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the duchess; <div class="bookquote">``but still, if we are to believe the history of Don Quixote that has come out here lately with general applause, it is to be inferred from it,
<p/>if I mistake not, that you never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady is nothing in the world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot and gave birth to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms and perfections you chose.
<p/>There is a good deal to be said on that point,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``God knows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in the world, or whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is imaginary or not imaginary; these are things the proof of which must not be pushed to extreme lengths.

 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said the duke; ``but Senor Don Quixote will give me leave to say what I am constrained to say by the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exploits that I have read, from which it is to be inferred that, granting there is a Dulcinea in El Toboso, or out of it, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is in the highest degree beautiful as you have described her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to us, as regards the loftiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lineage
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is not on a par with the Orianas, Alastrajareas, Madasimas, or others of that sort, with whom, as you well know, the histories abound.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To that I may reply,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``that Dulcinea is the daughter of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own works, and that virtues rectify blood, and that lowly virtue is more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice.
<p/>Dulcinea, besides, has that within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) that may raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) to be a crowned and sceptred queen; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capable of performing greater miracles; and virtually, though not formally, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has in herself higher fortunes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I protest, Senor Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, ``that in all you say, you go most cautiously and lead in hand, as the saying is; henceforth I will believe myself, and I will take care that everyone in my house believes, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is a Dulcinea in El Toboso, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) is living to-day, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) is beautiful and nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as Senor Don Quixote in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) service, and that is the highest praise that it is in my power to give her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) or that I can think of.
<p/>But I cannot help entertaining a doubt, and having a certain grudge against Sancho Panza; the doubt is this, that the aforesaid history declares that the said Sancho Panza, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) carried a letter on your worship's behalf to the said lady Dulcinea, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) sifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it says it was red wheat; a thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) lineage.
<p/>To this Don Quixote made answer, ``Senora, your highness must know that everything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinary limits of what happens to other knights-errant; whether it be that it is directed by the inscrutable will of destiny, or by the malice of some jealous enchanter.
<p/>Now it is an established fact that all or most famous knights-errant have some special gift, one that of being proof against enchantment, another that of being made of such invulnerable flesh that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cannot be wounded, as was the famous Roland, one of the twelve peers of France, of whom it is related that he (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) could not be wounded except in the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roland</b></font>) left foot, and that it must be with the point of a stout pin and not with any other sort of weapon whatever; and so, when Bernardo del Carpio slew him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) at Roncesvalles, finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) could not wound him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) with steel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) up from the ground in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>) arms and strangled him (<font color='blue'><b>Carpio</b></font>), calling to mind seasonably the death which Hercules inflicted on Antaeus, the fierce giant that they say was the son of Terra.
<p/>I would infer from what I have mentioned that perhaps I may have some gift of this kind, not that of being invulnerable, because experience has many times proved to me that I am of tender flesh and not at all impenetrable; nor that of being proof against enchantment, for I have already seen myself thrust into a cage, in which all the world would not have been able to confine me except by force of enchantments.
<p/>But as I delivered myself from that one, I am inclined to believe that there is no other that can hurt me; and so, these enchanters, seeing that they cannot exert their vile craft against my person
<p/>, revenge themselves on what I love most, and seek to rob me of life by maltreating that of Dulcinea in whom I live; and therefore I am convinced that when my squire carried my message to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), they changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) into a common peasant girl, engaged in such a mean occupation as sifting wheat; I have already said, however, that that wheat was not red wheat, nor wheat at all, but grains of orient pearl.
<p/>And as a proof of all this, I must tell your highnesses that, coming to El Toboso a short time back, I was altogether unable to discover the palace of Dulcinea; and that the next day, though Sancho, my squire, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) own proper shape, which is the fairest in the world, to me she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) appeared to be a coarse, ill-favoured farm-wench, and by no means a well-spoken one, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) who is propriety itself.
<p/>And so, as I am not and, so far as one can judge, cannot be enchanted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) it is that is enchanted, that is smitten, that is altered, changed, and transformed; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) have my enemies revenged themselves upon me, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) shall I live in ceaseless tears, until I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) pristine state.
<p/>I have mentioned this lest anybody should mind what Sancho said about Dulcinea's winnowing or sifting; for, as they changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) to me, it is no wonder if they changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>Dulcinea is illustrious and well-born, and of one of the gentle families of El Toboso, which are many, ancient, and good.
<p/>Therein, most assuredly, not small is the share of the peerless Dulcinea, through whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) town will be famous and celebrated in ages to come, as Troy was through Helen, and Spain through La Cava, though with a better title and tradition.
<p/>For another thing; I would have your graces understand that Sancho Panza is one of the drollest squires that ever served knight-errant; sometimes there is a simplicity about him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) so acute that it is an amusement to try and make out whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) is simple or sharp; he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) has mischievous tricks that stamp him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) rogue, and blundering ways that prove him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) a booby; he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) doubts everything and believes everything; when I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) is on the point of coming down headlong from sheer stupidity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) comes out with something shrewd that sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) up to the skies.
<p/>After all, I would not exchange him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) for another squire, though I were given a city to boot, and therefore I am in doubt whether it will be well to send him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) to the government your highness has bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>); though I perceive in him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) a certain aptitude for the work of governing, so that, with a little trimming of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) understanding, he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would manage any government as easily as the king does his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) taxes; and moreover, we know already ample experience that it does not require much cleverness or much learning to be a governor, for there are a hundred round about us that scarcely know how to read, and govern like gerfalcons.
<p/>The main point is that they should have good intentions and be desirous of doing right in all things, for they will never be at a loss for persons to advise and direct them in what they have to do, like those knight-governors who, being no lawyers, pronounce sentences with the aid of an assessor.
<p/>My advice to him (<font color='blue'><b>assessor</b></font>) will be to take no bribe and surrender no right, and I have some other little matters in reserve, that shall be produced in due season for Sancho's benefit and the advantage of the island
<p/>The duke, duchess, and Don Quixote had reached this point in their conversation, when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace, and Sancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger, with a straining-cloth by way of a bib, and followed by several servants, or, more properly speaking, kitchen-boys and other underlings, one of whom carried a small trough full of water, that from its colour and impurity was plainly dishwater.
<p/>The one with the trough pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went, endeavouring with the utmost persistence to thrust it under his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) chin, while another kitchen-boy seemed anxious to wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? Many a time before ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is to govern. '' '' What is all this, brothers?'' asked the duchess.
<p/>'' What is it? What do you want to do to this good man? Do you forget he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a governor-elect?
<p/>To which the barber kitchen-boy replied, <div class="bookquote">``The gentleman will not let himself be washed as is customary, and as my lord and the senor his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) master have been.''
 (<font color='red'><b>barber</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Yes, I will,'' said Sancho, in a great rage; ``but I'd like it to be with cleaner towels, clearer lye, and not such dirty hands
<p/>; for there's not so much difference between me and my master that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) should be washed with angels' water and I with devil's lye.
<p/>The customs of countries and princes' palaces are only good so long as they give no annoyance; but the way of washing they have here is worse than doing penance.
<p/>I have a clean beard, and I don't require to be refreshed in that fashion, and whoever comes to wash me or touch a hair of my head, I mean to say my beard, with all due respect be it said, I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) a punch that will leave my fist sunk in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) skull; for cirimonies and soapings of this sort are more like jokes than the polite attentions of one's host.
<p/>The duchess was ready to die with laughter when she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) saw Sancho's rage and heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) words; but it was no pleasure to Don Quixote to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in such a sorry trim, with the dingy towel about him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and the hangers-on of the kitchen all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); so making a low bow to the duke and duchess, as if to ask their permission to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) addressed the rout in a dignified tone:
<p/>you let that youth alone, and go back to where you came from, or anywhere else if you like; my squire is as clean as any other person, and those troughs are as bad as narrow thin-necked jars to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>); take my advice and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) alone, for neither he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) nor I understand joking.
<p/>Sancho took the word out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mouth and went on, ``Nay, let them come and try their jokes on the country bumpkin, for it's about as likely I'll stand them as that it's now midnight!
<p/>Let them bring me a comb here, or what they please, and curry this beard of mine, and if they get anything out of it that offends against cleanliness, let them clip me to the skin.
<p/>Upon this, the duchess, laughing all the while, said, ``Sancho Panza is right, and always will be in all he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) says; he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) is clean, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) says himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) does not require to be washed; and if our ways do not please him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) is free to choose.
<p/>Besides, you promoters of cleanliness have been excessively careless and thoughtless, I don't know if I ought not to say audacious, to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchen dishclouts, instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels of holland, to such a person and such a beard; but, after all, you are ill-conditioned and ill-bred, and spiteful as you are, you cannot help showing the grudge you have against the squires of knights-errant.
<p/>The impudent servitors, and even the seneschal who came with them, took the duchess to be speaking in earnest, so they removed the straining-cloth from Sancho's neck, and with something like shame and confusion of face went off all of them and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), seeing himself safe out of that extreme danger, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), ran and fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees before the duchess, saying, <div class="bookquote">``From great ladies great favours may be looked for; this which your grace has done me to-day cannot be requited with less than wishing I was dubbed a knight-errant, to devote myself all the days of my life to the service of so exalted a lady.
<p/>I am a labouring man, my name is Sancho Panza, I am married, I have children, and I am serving as a squire; if in any one of these ways I can serve your highness, I will not be longer in obeying than your grace in commanding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is easy to see, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>replied the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``that you have learned to be polite in the school of politeness itself; I mean to say it is easy to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of Senor Don Quixote, who is, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower of ceremony--or cirimony, as you would say yourself.
<p/>Fair be the fortunes of such a master and such a servant, the one the cynosure of knight-errantry, the other the star of squirely fidelity!
<p/>; I will repay your courtesy by taking care that my lord the duke makes good to you the promised gift of the government as soon as possible.
<p/>With this, the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote retired to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) midday sleep; but the duchess begged Sancho, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had a very great desire to go to sleep, to come and spend the afternoon with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) damsels in a very cool chamber.
<p/>Sancho replied that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heat of the day in summer, to serve her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) excellence he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would try with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might not to sleep even one that day, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would come in obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) command, and with that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went off.
<p/>The duke gave fresh orders with respect to treating Don Quixote as a knight-errant, without departing even in smallest particular from the style in which, as the stories tell us, they used to treat the knights of old.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Holloa, gentlemen! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' Rise, Sancho, my friend '' CHAPTER XXXIII. OF THE DELECTABLE DISCOURSE WHICH THE DUCHESS AND HER
<p/>The history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in order to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) word came, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had well done dinner, to visit the duchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sit down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good breeding, wanted not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was to sit down as governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was worthy of even the chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador.
<p/>Sancho shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess's damsels and duennas gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), waiting in profound silence to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would say.
<p/>It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying: ``Now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, I should be glad if the senor governor would relieve me of certain doubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is now in print.
<p/>One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote's letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>), for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) dare to invent the answer and all that about finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) sifting wheat, the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the prejudice of the peerless Dulcinea's good name, a thing that is not at all becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?
<p/>At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) chair, and with noiseless steps, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) body bent and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seat and said, ``Now, senora, that I have seen that there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or dread.
<p/>And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) says things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody's that listens to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself could not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond all question, it's my firm belief he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) is cracked.
<p/>Well, then, as this is clear to my mind, I can venture to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) believe things that have neither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter, and that other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history, that is to say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) is enchanted, though there's no more truth in it than over the hills of Ubeda.
<p/>The duchess begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) about the enchantment or deception, so Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hearers were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess said, <div class="bookquote">``In consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts up in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says, `If Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) squire knows it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), and goes trusting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) empty promises, there can be no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) must be still madder and sillier than his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) master; and that being so, it will be cast in your teeth, senora duchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to govern; for how will he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others?'''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/>DAMSELS HELD WITH SANCHO PANZA, WELL WORTH READING AND NOTING '' '' <div class="bookquote">``By God, senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but that doubt comes timely; but
<p/>your grace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like; for I know what you say is true, and if I were wise
<p/>, this was my bad luck; I can't help it, I must follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); we're from the same village, I've eaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bread, I'm fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>),
<p/>I'm grateful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass-colts, and above all I'm faithful; so it's quite impossible for anything to separate us, except the pickaxe and shovel.
<p/>And if your highness does not like to give me the government you promised, God made me without it, and maybe your not giving it to me will be all the better for my conscience, for fool as I am
<p/>I should have left my master long ago; but this was my fate I know the proverb `to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hurt the ant got wings,' and
<p/>They make as good bread here as in France,' and `by night all cats are grey,' and 'a hard case enough his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), who hasn't broken his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) fast at two in the afternoon,' and `there's no stomach a hand's breadth bigger than another,' and the same can be filled `with straw or hay,' as the saying is, and `the little birds of the field have God for their purveyor and caterer,' and `four yards of Cuenca frieze keep one warmer than four of Segovia broad-cloth,' and `when we quit this world and are put underground the prince travels by as narrow a path as the journeyman,' and `the Pope's body does not take up more feet of earth than the sacristan's,' for all that the one is higher than the other; for when we go to our graves we all pack ourselves up and make ourselves small, or rather they pack us up and make us small in spite of us, and then--good night to us.
<p/>And I say once more, if your ladyship does not like to give me the island because I'm a fool, like a wise man I will take care to give myself no trouble about it
<p/>; I have heard say that `behind the cross there's the devil,' and that `all that glitters is not gold,' and that from among the oxen, and the ploughs, and the yokes, Wamba the husbandman was taken to be made King of Spain, and from among brocades, and pleasures, and riches, Roderick was taken to be devoured by adders, if the verses of the old ballads don't lie.
<p/>it may be that Sancho the squire will get to heaven sooner than Sancho the governor. ' ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' To be sure they don't lie!'' exclaimed Dona Rodriguez, the duenna, who was one of the listeners.
<p/>Why, there's a ballad that says they put King Rodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads, and adders, and lizards, and that two days afterwards the king, in a plaintive, feeble voice, cried out from within the tomb--
<p/>And according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would rather be a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>The duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) duenna, or wondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Worthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made a promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) strives to keep it, though it should cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) life.
<p/>My lord and husband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is none the less a knight for that reason, and will keep his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) word about the promised island, in spite of the envy and malice of the world.
<p/>Let Sancho be of good cheer; for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) least expects it he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) will find himself seated on the throne of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) island and seat of dignity, and will take possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) government that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) may discard it for another of three-bordered brocade.
<p/>The charge I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is to be careful how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) governs his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) vassals, bearing in mind that they are all loyal and well-born.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As to governing them well,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``there's no need of charging me to do that, for I'm kind-hearted by nature, and full of compassion for the poor; there's no stealing the loaf from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who kneads and bakes;' and by my faith it won't do to throw false dice with me; I am an old dog, and I know all about `tus, tus;' I can be wide-awake if need be, and I don't let clouds come before my eyes, for I know where the shoe pinches me
<p/>; I say so, because with me the good will have support and protection, and the bad neither footing nor access.
<p/>And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I'll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>They gnaw me now, they gnaw me now, There where I most did sin. '' '' I have been brought up to.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``for no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones.
<p/>But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho's idea of practising a deception upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not recognise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) it must be because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote.
<p/>For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw.
<p/>Senor Sancho Panza must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and when we least expect it, we shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is under at present.
<p/>All that's very possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said Sancho Panza; ``and now I'm willing to believe what my master says about what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) saw in the cave of Montesinos, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in when I enchanted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) all to please myself.
<p/>It must be all exactly the other way, as your ladyship says; because it is impossible to suppose that out of my poor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment, nor do I think my master is so mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could be made to believe a thing so out of all reason.
<p/>But, senora, your excellence must not therefore think me ill-disposed, for a dolt like me is not bound to see into the thoughts and plots of those vile enchanters.
<p/>I invented all that to escape my master's scolding, and not with any intention of hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); and if it has turned out differently, there is a God in heaven who judges our hearts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess; ``but tell me, Sancho, what is this you say about the cave of Montesinos, for I should like to know.
<p/>Sancho upon this related to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), word for word, what has been said already touching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said, <div class="bookquote">``From this occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great Don Quixote says he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw there the same country wench Sancho saw on the way from El Toboso, it is, no doubt, Dulcinea, and that there are some very active and exceedingly busy enchanters about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/>So I say,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and if my lady Dulcinea is enchanted, so much the worse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), and I'm not going to pick a quarrel with my master's enemies, who seem to be many and spiteful.
<p/>The truth is that the one I saw was a country wench, and I set her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) down to be a country wench; and if that was Dulcinea it must not be laid at my door, nor should I be called to answer for it or take the consequences.
<p/>Sancho did it, Sancho here, Sancho there,' as if Sancho was nobody at all, and not that same Sancho Panza that's now going all over the world in books, so Samson Carrasco told me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>)'s at any rate one that's a bachelor of Salamanca; and people of that sort can't lie, except when the whim seizes them or they have some very good reason for it.
<p/>So there's no occasion for anybody to quarrel with me; and then I have a good character, and, as I have heard my master say, 'a good name is better than great riches
<p/>;' let them only stick me into this government and they'll see wonders, for one who has been a good squire will be a good governor.
<p/>All worthy Sancho's observations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``are Catonian sentences, or at any rate out of the very heart of Michael Verino himself, who florentibus occidit annis.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess sentences</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' But they must go nagging at me at every step--`Sancho said it, '' '' In fact, to speak in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own style, `under a bad cloak there's often a good drinker.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I never yet drank out of wickedness; from thirst I have very likely, for I have nothing of the hypocrite in me
<p/>; I drink when I'm inclined, or, if I'm not inclined, when they offer it to me, so as not to look either strait-laced or ill-bred; for when a friend drinks one's health what heart can be so hard as not to return it?
<p/>But if I put on my shoes I don't dirty them; besides, squires to knights-errant mostly drink water, for they are always wandering among woods, forests and meadows, mountains and crags, without a drop of wine to be had if they gave their eyes for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>So I believe,'' said the duchess; <div class="bookquote">``and now let Sancho go and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sleep, and we will talk by-and-by at greater length, and settle how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) may soon go and stick himself into the government, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) says.
<p/>Sancho once more kissed the duchess's hand, and entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) to let good care be taken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Dapple, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>My ass,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``which, not to mention him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) by that name, I'm accustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna here to take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) when I came into the castle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) got as angry as if I had said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural and proper for duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' What is Dapple?'' said the duchess. '' God bless me! what a spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must have been some clown,'' said Dona Rodriguez the duenna; <div class="bookquote">``for if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been a gentleman and well-born he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have exalted them higher than the horns of the moon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rodriguez the duenna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess; ``no more of this; hush, Dona Rodriguez, and let Senor Panza rest easy and leave the treatment of Dapple in my charge, for as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a treasure of Sancho's, I'll put him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on the apple of my eye.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to be in the stable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``for neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of your highness's eye, and I'd as soon stab myself as consent to it; for though my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a card too many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses we must mind what we are about and keep within due bounds.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to your government, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, ``and there you will be able to make as much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) as you like, and even release him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) from work and pension him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think, senora duchess, that you have said anything absurd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I have seen more than two asses go to governments, and for me to take mine with me would be nothing new.
<p/>Sancho's words made the duchess laugh again and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) fresh amusement, and dismissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to sleep she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) went away to tell the duke the conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) had had with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and between them they plotted and arranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare one and entirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they practised several upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), so much in keeping and so clever that they form the best adventures this great history contains.
<p/>THE PEERLESS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO, WHICH IS ONE OF THE RAREST ADVENTURES IN THIS BOOK Great was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza; and, more bent than ever upon the plan they had of practising some jokes upon them that should have the look and appearance of adventures, they took as their basis of action what Don Quixote had already told them about the cave of Montesinos, in order to play him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a famous one.
<p/>But what the duchess marvelled at above all was that Sancho's simplicity could be so great as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) believe as absolute truth that Dulcinea had been enchanted, when it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) himself who had been the enchanter and trickster in the business.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' CHAPTER XXXIV. WHICH RELATES HOW THEY LEARNED THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE TO DISENCHANT Having, therefore, instructed their servants in everything they were to do, six days afterwards
<p/>They presented Don Quixote with a hunting suit, and Sancho with another of the finest green cloth; but Don Quixote declined to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) on, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must soon return to the hard pursuit of arms, and could not carry wardrobes or stores with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) out to hunt, with as great a retinue of huntsmen and beaters as a crowned king. Sancho, however, took what they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), meaning to sell it at the first opportunity.
<p/>The appointed day having arrived, Don Quixote armed himself, and Sancho arrayed himself, and mounted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Dapple -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) up though they offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a horse-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) placed himself in the midst of the troop of huntsmen.
<p/>The duchess came out splendidly attired, and Don Quixote, in pure courtesy and politeness, held the rein of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) palfrey, though the duke wanted not to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); and at last they reached a wood that lay between two high mountains, where, after occupying various posts, ambushes, and paths, and distributing the party in different positions, the hunt began with great noise, shouting, and hallooing, so that, between the baying of the hounds and the blowing of the horns, they could not hear one another.
<p/>The duchess dismounted, and with a sharp boar-spear in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) hand posted herself where she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) knew the wild boars were in the habit of passing.
<p/>Sancho took up a position in the rear of all without dismounting from Dapple, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) dared not desert lest some mischief should befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>Scarcely had they taken their stand in a line with several of their servants, when they saw a huge boar, closely pressed by the hounds and followed by the huntsmen, making towards them, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) teeth and tusks, and scattering foam from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Don Quixote, bracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shield on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm, and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword, advanced to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); the duke with boar-spear did the same; but the duchess would have gone in front of them all had not the duke prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>).
<p/>Sancho alone, deserting Dapple at the sight of the mighty beast, took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heels as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could and strove in vain to mount a tall oak.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was clinging to a branch, however, half-way up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) struggle to reach the top, the bough, such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ill-luck and hard fate, gave way, and caught in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fall by a broken limb of the oak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hung suspended in the air unable to reach the ground.
<p/>Finding himself in this position, and that the green coat was beginning to tear, and reflecting that if the fierce animal came that way he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might be able to get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) began to utter such cries, and call for help so earnestly, that all who heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) must be in the teeth of some wild beast.
<p/>In the end the tusked boar fell pierced by the blades of the many spears they held in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); and Don Quixote, turning round at the cries of Sancho, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew by them that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hanging from the oak head downwards, with Dapple, who did not forsake him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) distress, close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); and Cide Hamete observes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seldom saw Sancho Panza without seeing Dapple, or Dapple without seeing Sancho Panza; such was their attachment and loyalty one to the other.
<p/>Don Quixote went over and unhooked Sancho, who, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) found himself on the ground, looked at the rent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) huntingcoat and was grieved to the heart, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had got a patrimonial estate in that suit.
<p/>Meanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule, and having covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle, they bore it away as the spoils of victory to some large field-tents which had been pitched in the middle of the wood, where they found the tables laid and dinner served, in such grand and sumptuous style that it was easy to see the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it.
<p/>Sancho, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) showed the rents in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) torn suit to the duchess, observed, <div class="bookquote">``If we had been hunting hares, or after small birds, my coat would have been safe from being in the plight
<p/>; I don't know what pleasure one can find in lying in wait for an animal that may take your life with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tusk if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gets at you.
<p/>The duke and Don Quixote likewise dismounted and placed themselves one at each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>). it's in I recollect having heard an old ballad sung that says, By bears be thou devoured, as erst Was famous Favila.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and I would not have kings and princes expose themselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasure which, to my mind, ought not to be one, as it consists in killing an animal that has done no harm whatever.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>That,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``was a Gothic king, who, going a-hunting, was devoured by a bear. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Quite the contrary,
<p/>Sancho; you are wrong there,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said the duke; <div class="bookquote">``for hunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and princes than for anybody else.
<p/>The chase is the emblem of war; it has stratagems, wiles, and crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety; in it extreme cold and intolerable heat have to be borne, indolence and sleep are despised, the bodily powers are invigorated, the limbs of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who engages in it are made supple, and, in a word, it is a pursuit which may be followed without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many; and the best of it is, it is not for everybody, as field-sports of other sorts are, except hawking, which also is only for kings and great lords.
<p/>Reconsider your opinion therefore, Sancho, and when you are governor take to hunting, and you will find the good of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``the good governor should have a broken leg and keep at home;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>it would be a nice thing if, after people had been at the trouble of coming to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on business, the governor were to be away in the forest enjoying himself; the government would go on badly in that fashion.
<p/>By my faith, senor, hunting and amusements are more fit for idlers than for governors; what I intend to amuse myself with is playing all fours at Eastertime, and bowls on Sundays and holidays; for these huntings don't suit my condition or agree with my conscience.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be that as it may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ''`pledges don't distress a good payer,' and `he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) whom God helps does better than he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who gets up early,' and `it's the tripes that carry the feet and not the feet the tripes;'
<p/>I mean to say that if God gives me help and I do my duty honestly, no doubt I'll govern better than a gerfalcon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God grant it may turn out so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said the duke; <div class="bookquote">``because it's a long step from saying to doing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>Nay, let them only put a finger in my mouth, and they'll see whether I can bite or not.
<p/>'' exclaimed Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``when will the day come--as I have often said to thee--when I shall hear thee make one single coherent, rational remark without proverbs?
<p/>Pray, your highnesses, leave this fool alone, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will grind your souls between, not to say two, but two thousand proverbs, dragged in as much in season, and as much to the purpose as--may God grant as much health to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), or to me if I want to listen to them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sancho Panza's proverbs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``though more in number than the Greek Commander's, are not therefore less to be esteemed for the conciseness of the maxims.
<p/>For my own part, I can say they give me more pleasure than others that may be better brought in and more seasonably introduced.
<p/>In pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent into the wood, and the day was spent in visiting some of the posts and hiding-places, and then night closed in, not, however, as brilliantly or tranquilly as might have been expected at the season, for it was then midsummer; but bringing with it a kind of haze that greatly aided the project of the duke and duchess; and thus, as night began to fall, and a little after twilight set in, suddenly the whole wood on all four sides seemed to be on fire, and shortly after, here, there, on all sides, a vast number of trumpets and other military instruments were heard, as if several troops of cavalry were passing through the wood.
<p/>The blaze of the fire and the noise of the warlike instruments almost blinded the eyes and deafened the ears of those that stood by, and indeed of all who were in the wood.
<p/>Then there were heard repeated lelilies after the fashion of the Moors when they rush to battle; trumpets and clarions brayed, drums beat, fifes played, so unceasingly and so fast that he (<font color='blue'><b>troops</b></font>) could not have had any senses who did not lose them with the confused din of so many instruments.
<p/>The duke was astounded, the duchess amazed, Don Quixote wondering, Sancho Panza trembling, and indeed, even they who were aware of the cause were frightened.
<p/>In their fear, silence fell upon them, and a postillion, in the guise of a demon, passed in front of them, blowing, in lieu of a bugle, a huge hollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse note.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>'' The curse of God and all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saints upon thee, thou accursed Sancho! '' '' Ho there! brother courier
<p/>,'' cried the duke, ``who are you? Where are you going? What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?
<p/>To which the courier replied in a harsh, discordant voice, <div class="bookquote">``I am the devil; I am in search of Don Quixote of La Mancha; those who are coming this way are six troops of enchanters, who are bringing on a triumphal car the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso; she (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) comes under enchantment, together with the gallant Frenchman Montesinos, to give instructions to Don Quixote as to how, she (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the said lady, may be disenchanted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the courier</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were the devil, as you say and as your appearance indicates,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said the duke, <div class="bookquote">``you would have known the said knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, for you have him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) here before you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By God and upon my conscience,''  (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div>said the devil, <div class="bookquote">``I never observed it, for my mind is occupied with so many different things that I was forgetting the main thing I came about.
<p/>This demon must be an honest fellow and a good Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wouldn't swear by God and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) conscience; I feel sure now there must be good souls even in hell itself.
<p/>Without dismounting, the demon then turned to Don Quixote and said, <div class="bookquote">``The unfortunate but valiant knight Montesinos sends me to thee, the Knight of the Lions -LRB-would that I saw thee in their claws-RRB-, bidding me tell thee to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) wherever I may find thee, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) brings with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) whom they call Dulcinea del Toboso, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) may show thee what is needful in order to disenchant her (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); and as I came for no more I need stay no longer; demons of my sort be with thee, and good angels with these gentles;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) huge horn, turned about and went off without waiting for a reply from anyone.
<p/>They all felt fresh wonder, but particularly Sancho and Don Quixote; Sancho to see how, in defiance of the truth, they would have it that Dulcinea was enchanted; Don Quixote because he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not feel sure whether what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the cave of Montesinos was true or not; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) was deep in these cogitations the duke said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to wait, Senor Don Quixote?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Why not? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``here will I wait, fearless and firm, though all hell should come to attack me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Well then, if I see another devil or hear another horn like the last, I'll wait here as much as in Flanders,'' said Sancho.
<p/>Night now closed in more completely, and many lights began to flit through the wood, just as those fiery exhalations from the earth, that look like shooting-stars to our eyes, flit through the heavens; a frightful noise, too, was heard, like that made by the solid wheels the ox-carts usually have, by the harsh, ceaseless creaking of which, they say, the bears and wolves are put to flight, if there happen to be any where they are passing.
<p/>In addition to all this commotion, there came a further disturbance to increase the tumult, for now it seemed as if in truth, on all four sides of the wood, four encounters or battles were going on at the same time; in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a terrible cannonade, in another numberless muskets were being discharged, the shouts of the combatants sounded almost close at hand, and farther away the Moorish lelilies were raised again and again.
<p/>In a word, the bugles, the horns, the clarions, the trumpets, the drums, the cannon, the musketry, and above all the tremendous noise of the carts, all made up together a din so confused and terrific that Don Quixote had need to summon up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) courage to brave it; but Sancho's gave way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fell fainting on the skirt of the duchess's robe, who let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lie there and promptly bade them throw water in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) face.
<p/>This was done, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came to himself by the time that one of the carts with the creaking wheels reached the spot.
<p/>It was drawn by four plodding oxen all covered with black housings; on each horn they had fixed a large lighted wax taper, and on the top of the cart was constructed a raised seat, on which sat a venerable old man with a beard whiter than the very snow, and so long that it fell below his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waist; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dressed in a long robe of black buckram; for as the cart was thickly set with a multitude of candles it was easy to make out everything that was on it.
<p/>Leading it were two hideous demons, also clad in buckram, with countenances so frightful that Sancho, having once seen them, shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes so as not to see them again.
<p/>As soon as the cart came opposite the spot the old man rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lofty seat, and standing up said in a loud voice, <div class="bookquote">``I am the sage Lirgandeo,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and without another word the cart then passed on.
<p/>Behind it came another of the same form, with another aged man enthroned, who, stopping the cart, said in a voice no less solemn than that of the first, <div class="bookquote">``I am the sage Alquife, the great friend of Urganda the Unknown,''  (<font color='red'><b>another man</b></font>)</div>and passed on.
<p/>Then another cart came by at the same pace, but the occupant of the throne was not old like the others, but a man stalwart and robust, and of a forbidding countenance, who as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came up said in a voice far hoarser and more devilish, <div class="bookquote">``I am the enchanter Archelaus, the mortal enemy of Amadis of Gaul and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) kindred,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then passed on.
<p/>Having gone a short distance the three carts halted and the monotonous noise of their wheels ceased, and soon after they heard another, not noise, but sound of sweet, harmonious music, of which Sancho was very glad, taking it to be a good sign; and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to the duchess, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not stir a step, or for a single instant, <div class="bookquote">``Senora, where there's music there can't be mischief.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Nor where there are lights and it is bright,'' said the duchess; to which Sancho replied, <div class="bookquote">``Fire gives light, and it's bright where there are bonfires, as we see by those that are all round us and perhaps may burn us; but music is a sign of mirth and merrymaking.
<p/>That remains to be seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, who was listening to all that passed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was right, as is shown in the following chapter.
<p/>'' '' '' '' CHAPTER XXXV. WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO DON QUIXOTE TOUCHING THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA, TOGETHER WITH
<p/>They saw advancing towards them, to the sound of this pleasing music, what they call a triumphal car, drawn by six grey mules with white linen housings, on each of which was mounted a penitent, robed also in white, with a large lighted wax taper in his (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The car was twice or, perhaps, three times as large as the former ones, and in front and on the sides stood twelve more penitents, all as white as snow and all with lighted tapers, a spectacle to excite fear as well as wonder; and on a raised throne was seated a nymph draped in a multitude of silver-tissue veils with an embroidery of countless gold spangles glittering all over them, that made her (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) appear, if not richly, at least brilliantly, apparelled.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) face covered with thin transparent sendal, the texture of which did not prevent the fair features of a maiden from being distinguished, while the numerous lights made it possible to judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) beauty and of her (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) years, which seemed to be not less than seventeen but not to have yet reached twenty.
<p/>Beside her (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) was a figure in a robe of state, as they call it, reaching to the feet, while the head was covered with a black veil.
<p/>But the instant the car was opposite the duke and duchess and Don Quixote the music of the clarions ceased, and then that of the lutes and harps on the car, and the figure in the robe rose up, and flinging it apart and removing the veil from its face, disclosed to their eyes the shape of Death itself, fleshless and hideous, at which sight Don Quixote felt uneasy, Sancho frightened, and the duke and duchess displayed a certain trepidation.
<p/>Having risen to its feet, this living death, in a sleepy voice and with a tongue hardly awake, held forth as follows: I am that Merlin who the legends say
<p/>Of magic prince, of Zoroastric lore Monarch and treasurer, with jealous eye I view the efforts of the age to hide The gallant deeds of doughty errant knights, Who are, and ever have been, dear to me.
<p/>Enchanters and magicians and their kind Are mostly hard of heart; not so am I; For mine is tender, soft, compassionate, And its delight is doing good to all.
<p/>In the dim caverns of the gloomy Dis, Where, tracing mystic lines and characters, My soul abideth now, there came to me The sorrow-laden plaint of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), the fair, The peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>I knew of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) enchantment and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) fate, From high-born dame to peasant wench transformed And touched with pity, first I turned the leaves Of countless volumes of my devilish craft,
<p/>And then, in this grim grisly skeleton Myself encasing, hither have I come To show where lies the fitting remedy To give relief in such a piteous case.
<p/>OTHER MARVELLOUS INCIDENTS The devil had for father, and the lie Hath gathered credence with the lapse of time. O thou, the pride and pink of all that I wear The adamantine steel!
<p/>O shining light, O beacon, polestar, path and guide of all Who, scorning slumber and the lazy down, Adopt the toilsome life of bloodstained arms!
<p/>To thee, great hero who all praise transcends, La Mancha's lustre and Iberia's star, Don Quixote, wise as brave, to thee I say--
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pristine form and beauty to regain, 'T is needful that thy esquire Sancho shall, On his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own sturdy buttocks bared to heaven, Three thousand and three hundred lashes lay, And that they smart and sting and hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) well.
<p/>For peerless Dulcinea del Toboso Thus have the authors of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) woe resolved. And this is, gentles, wherefore I have come.
<p/>By all that's good,'' exclaimed Sancho at this, <div class="bookquote">``I'll just as soon give myself three stabs with a dagger as three, not to say three thousand, lashes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>The devil take such a way of disenchanting! I don't see what my backside has got to do with enchantments.
<p/>By God, if Senor Merlin has not found out some other way of disenchanting the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) may go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) grave enchanted.''
<p/>But I'll take you, Don Clown stuffed with garlic,'' said Don Quixote, ``and tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother brought you forth, and give you, not to say three thousand three hundred, but six thousand six hundred lashes, and so well laid on that they won't be got rid of if you try three thousand three hundred times; don't answer me a word or I'll tear your soul out.
<p/>On hearing this Merlin said, <div class="bookquote">``That will not do, for the lashes worthy Sancho has to receive must be given of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own free will and not by force, and at whatever time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pleases, for there is no fixed limit assigned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but it is permitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) likes to commute by half the pain of this whipping, to let them be given by the hand of another, though it may be somewhat weighty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Merlin/Senor Merlin</b></font>)</div><p/>Was it I that gave birth to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, that my backside is to pay for the sins of her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) eyes?
<p/>My master, indeed, that's a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>)--for, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s always calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) `my life' and `my soul,' and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stay and prop--may and ought to whip himself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) and take all the trouble required for her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) disenchantment.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Not a hand, my own or anybody else's, weighty or weighable, shall touch me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' But for me to whip myself!
<p/>As soon as Sancho had done speaking the nymph in silver that was at the side of Merlin's ghost stood up, and removing the thin veil from her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) face disclosed one that seemed to all something more than exceedingly beautiful; and with a masculine freedom from embarrassment and in a voice not very like a lady's, addressing Sancho directly, said, ``Thou wretched squire, soul of a pitcher, heart of a cork tree, with bowels of flint and pebbles; if, thou impudent thief, they bade thee throw thyself down from some lofty tower; if, enemy of mankind, they asked thee to swallow a dozen of toads, two of lizards, and three of adders; if they wanted thee to slay thy wife and children with a sharp murderous scimitar, it would be no wonder for thee to show thyself stubborn and squeamish.
<p/>But to make a piece of work about three thousand three hundred lashes, what every poor little charity-boy gets every month--it is enough to amaze, astonish, astound the compassionate bowels of all who hear it, nay, all who come to hear it in the course of time.
<p/>Turn, O miserable, hard-hearted animal, turn, I say, those timorous owl's eyes upon these of mine that are compared to radiant stars, and thou wilt see them weeping trickling streams and rills, and tracing furrows, tracks, and paths over the fair fields of my cheeks.
<p/>Let it move thee, crafty, ill-conditioned monster, to see my blooming youth--still in its teens, for I am not yet twenty--wasting and withering away beneath the husk of a rude peasant wench; and if I do not appear in that shape now, it is a special favour Senor Merlin here has granted me, to the sole end that my beauty may soften thee; for the tears of beauty in distress turn rocks into cotton and tigers into ewes.
<p/>Lay on to that hide of thine, thou great untamed brute, rouse up thy lusty vigour that only urges thee to eat and eat, and set free the softness of my flesh, the gentleness of my nature, and the fairness of my face.
<p/>And if thou wilt not relent or come to reason for me, do so for the sake of that poor knight thou hast beside thee; thy master I mean, whose soul I can this moment see,
<p/>how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) has it stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) throat not ten fingers from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lips, and only waiting for thy inflexible or yielding reply to make its escape by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mouth or go back again into his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stomach.
<p/>Don Quixote on hearing this felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) throat, and turning to the duke he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``By God, senor, Dulcinea says true, I have my soul stuck here in my throat like the nut of a crossbow.
<p/>Abernuncio! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' What say you to this, Sancho?'' said the duchess. '' I say, senora,'' returned Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``what I said before; as for the lashes, abernuncio!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Abrenuncio, you should say, Sancho, and not as you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said the duke. <div class="bookquote">``Let me alone, your highness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. ''
<p/>I'm not in a humour now to look into niceties or a letter more or less, for these lashes that are to be given me, or I'm to give myself, have so upset me, that I don't know what I'm saying or doing.
<p/>But I'd like to know of this lady, my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) learned this way she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has of asking favours.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) comes to ask me to score my flesh with lashes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) calls me soul of a pitcher, and great untamed brute, and a string of foul names that the devil is welcome to.
<p/>Is my flesh brass? or is it anything to me whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is enchanted or not? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bring with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a basket of fair linen, shirts, kerchiefs, socks-not that wear any--to coax me?
<p/>No, nothing but one piece of abuse after another, though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows the proverb they have here that `an ass loaded with gold goes lightly up a mountain,' and that `gifts break rocks,' and `praying to God and plying the hammer,' and that `one <div class="bookquote">``take''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>is better than two
<p/>Then there's my master, who ought to stroke me down and pet me to make me turn wool and carded cotton; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) says if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gets hold of me he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'ll tie me naked to a tree and double the tale of lashes on me.
<p/>These tender-hearted gentry should consider that it's not merely a squire, but a governor they are asking to whip himself; just as if it was `drink with cherries.'
<p/>Let them learn, plague take them, the right way to ask, and beg, and behave themselves; for all times are not alike, nor are people always in good humour.
<p/>I'm now ready to burst with grief at seeing my green coat torn, and they come to ask me to whip myself of my own free will, I having as little fancy for it as for turning cacique.''
<p/>Well then, the fact is, friend Sancho,'' said the duke, ``that unless you become softer than a ripe fig, you shall not get hold of the government.
<p/>It would be a nice thing for me to send my islanders a cruel governor with flinty bowels, who won't yield to the tears of afflicted damsels or to the prayers of wise, magisterial, ancient enchanters and sages.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give thee's. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>' '' In short, Sancho, either you must be whipped by yourself, or they must whip you, or you shan't be governor.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``won't two days' grace be given me in which to consider what is best for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>,'' said Merlin; <div class="bookquote">``here, this minute, and on the spot, the matter must be settled; either Dulcinea will return to the cave of Montesinos and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) former condition of peasant wench, or else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) present form
<p/>No, certainly not shall be carried to the Elysian fields, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) will remain waiting until the number of stripes is completed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Merlin/Senor Merlin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, Sancho!''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, ``show courage, and gratitude for your master Don Quixote's bread that you have eaten; we are all bound to oblige and please him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) benevolent disposition and lofty chivalry.
<p/>Consent to this whipping, my son; to the devil with the devil, and leave fear to milksops, for 'a stout heart breaks bad luck,' as you very well know.
<p/>To this Sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which, addressing Merlin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>), ``Will your worship tell me, Senor Merlin--when that courier devil came up he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) gave my master a message from Senor Montesinos, charging him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) here, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) was coming to arrange how the lady Dona Dulcinea del Toboso was to be disenchanted; but up to the present we have not seen Montesinos, nor anything like him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>).
<p/>To which Merlin made answer, <div class="bookquote">``The devil, Sancho, is a blockhead and a great scoundrel; I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to look for your master, but not with a message from Montesinos but from myself; for Montesinos is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) cave expecting, or more properly speaking, waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) disenchantment; for there's the tail to be skinned yet for him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>); if he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) owes you anything, or you have any business to transact with him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>), I'll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) to you and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) where you choose; but for the present make up your mind to consent to this penance, and believe me it will be very good for you, for soul as well for body--for your soul because of the charity with which you perform it, for your body because I know that you are of a sanguine habit and it will do you no harm to draw a little blood.
<p/>There are a great many doctors in the world; even the enchanters are doctors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Merlin/Senor Merlin</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``however, as everybody tells me the same thing--though I can't see it myself--I say I am willing to give myself the three thousand three hundred lashes, provided I am to lay them on whenever I like, without any fixing of days or times; and I'll try and get out of debt as quickly as I can, that the world may enjoy the beauty of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; as it seems, contrary to what I thought, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is beautiful after all.
<p/>It must be a condition, too, that I am not to be bound to draw blood with the scourge, and that if any of the lashes happen to be fly-flappers they are to count.
<p/>Item, that, in case I should make any mistake in the reckoning, Senor Merlin, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) knows everything, is to keep count, and let me know how many are still wanting or over the number.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be no need to let you know of any over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Merlin/Senor Merlin</b></font>)</div>said Merlin, <div class="bookquote">``because, when you reach the full number, the lady Dulcinea will at once, and that very instant, be disenchanted, and will come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) gratitude to seek out the worthy Sancho, and thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and even reward him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) for the good work.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Merlin/Senor Merlin</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' So you have no cause to be uneasy about stripes too many or too few ; heaven forbid I should cheat anyone of even a hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head.''
<p/>'' Well then, in God's hands be it,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``in the hard case I'm in I give in; I say I accept the penance on the conditions laid down.
<p/>The instant Sancho uttered these last words the music of the clarions struck up once more, and again a host of muskets were discharged, and Don Quixote hung on Sancho's neck kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) again and again on the forehead and cheeks.
<p/>The duchess and the duke expressed the greatest satisfaction, the car began to move on, and as it passed the fair Dulcinea bowed to the duke and duchess and made a low curtsey to Sancho.
<p/>And now bright smiling dawn came on apace; the flowers of the field, revived, raised up their heads, and the crystal waters of the brooks, murmuring over the grey and white pebbles, hastened to pay their tribute to the expectant rivers; the glad earth, the unclouded sky, the fresh breeze, the clear light, each and all showed that the day that came treading on the skirts of morning would be calm and bright.
<p/>The duke and duchess, pleased with their hunt and at having carried out their plans so cleverly and successfully, returned to their castle resolved to follow up their joke; for to them there was no reality that could afford them more amusement.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXXVI. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE DISTRESSED DUENNA, ALIAS THE COUNTESS TRIFALDI, TOGETHER WITH A LETTER
<p/>The duke had a majordomo of a very facetious and sportive turn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) it was that played the part of Merlin, made all the arrangements for the late adventure, composed the verses, and got a page to represent Dulcinea; and now, with the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) master and mistress
<p/>WHICH SANCHO PANZA WROTE TO HIS (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) WIFE, TERESA PANZA , he (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) got up another of the drollest and strangest contrivances that can be imagined.
<p/>The duchess asked Sancho the next day if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had made a beginning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) penance task which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had to perform for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had, and had given himself five lashes overnight. The duchess asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had given them with.
<p/>That,'' said the duchess, ``is more like giving oneself slaps than lashes; I am sure the sage Merlin will not be satisfied with such tenderness; worthy Sancho must make a scourge with claws, or a cat-o'-nine tails, that will make itself felt; for it's with blood that letters enter, and the release of so great a lady as Dulcinea will not be granted so cheaply, or at such a paltry price; and remember, Sancho, that works of charity done in a lukewarm and half-hearted way are without merit and of no avail.
<p/>To which Sancho replied, <div class="bookquote">``If your ladyship will give me a proper scourge or cord, I'll lay on with it, provided it does not hurt too much; for you must know, boor as I am, my flesh is more cotton than hemp, and it won't do for me to destroy myself for the good of anybody else.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>So be it by all means,'' said the duchess; ``to-morrow I'll give you a scourge that will be just the thing for you, and will accommodate itself to the tenderness of your flesh, as if it was its own sister.
<p/>Then said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Your highness must know, dear lady of my soul, that I have a letter written to my wife, Teresa Panza, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) an account of all that has happened me since I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>); I have it here in my bosom, and there's nothing wanting but to put the address to it; I'd be glad if your discretion would read it,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' for I think it runs in the governor style ; I mean the way governors ought to write.''
<p/>'' And who dictated it? '' asked the duchess. '' Who should have dictated but myself, sinner as I am?'' said Sancho.
<p/>'' And did you write it yourself?'' said the duchess. '' That I didn't,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for I can neither read nor write, though I can sign my name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``for never fear but you display in it the quality and quantity of your wit.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>Sancho drew out an open letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bosom, and the duchess, taking it, found it ran in this fashion:
<p/>I went mounted like a gentleman; if I have got a good government it is at the cost of a good whipping.
<p/>SANCHO PANZA'S LETTER TO HIS (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) WIFE, TERESA PANZA If I was well whipped Thou wilt not understand this just now, my Teresa; by-and-by thou wilt know what it means.
<p/>I may tell thee, Teresa, I mean thee to go in a coach, for that is a matter of importance, because every other way of going is going on all-fours.
<p/>I send thee here a green hunting suit that my lady the duchess gave me; alter it so as to make a petticoat and bodice for our daughter.
<p/>Don Quixote, my master, if I am to believe what I hear in these parts, is a madman of some sense, and a droll blockhead, and I am no way behind him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>).
<p/>We have been in the cave of Montesinos, and the sage Merlin has laid hold of me for the disenchantment of Dulcinea del Toboso, her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) that is called Aldonza Lorenzo over there.
<p/>With three thousand three hundred lashes, less five, that I'm to give myself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) will be left as entirely disenchanted as the mother that bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>).
<p/>Say nothing of this to anyone; for, make thy affairs public, and some will say they are white and others will say they are black.
<p/>I shall leave this in a few days for my government, to which I am going with a mighty great desire to make money, for they tell me all new governors set out with the same desire; I will feel the pulse of it and will let thee know if thou art to come and live with me or not.
<p/>Dapple is well and sends many remembrances to thee; I am not going to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) behind though they took me away to be Grand Turk.
<p/>My lady the duchess kisses thy hands a thousand times; do thou make a return with two thousand, for as my master says, nothing costs less or is cheaper than civility.
<p/>God has not been pleased to provide another valise for me with another hundred crowns, like the one the other day; but never mind, my Teresa, the bell-ringer is in safe quarters, and all will come out in the scouring of the government; only it troubles me greatly what they tell me--that once I have tasted it I will eat my hands off after it; and if that is so it will not come very cheap to me; though to be sure the maimed have a benefice of their own in the alms they beg for; so that one way or another thou wilt be rich and in luck.
<p/>Thou art a governor's wife; take care that nobody speaks evil of thee behind thy back. God give it to thee as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) can, and keep me to serve thee.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done reading the letter the duchess said to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``On two points the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying or hinting that this government has been bestowed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) for the lashes that he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) is to give himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) knows -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) cannot deny it-RRB- that when my lord the duke promised it to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) nobody ever dreamt of such a thing as lashes; the other is that he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) shows himself here to be very covetous; and I would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) a money-seeker, for `covetousness bursts the bag,' and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice.
<p/>From this castle, the 20th of July, 1614. Thy husband, the governor. SANCHO PANZA ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean it that way, senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``and if you think the letter doesn't run as it ought to do, it's only to tear it up and make another; and maybe it will be a worse one if it is left to my gumption.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>With this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine, and the duchess showed Sancho's letter to the duke, who was highly delighted with it.
<p/>They dined, and after the cloth had been removed and they had amused themselves for a while with Sancho's rich conversation, the melancholy sound of a fife and harsh discordant drum made itself heard.
<p/>All seemed somewhat put out by this dull, confused, martial harmony, especially Don Quixote, who could not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seat from pure disquietude; as to Sancho, it is needless to say that fear drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) usual refuge, the side or the skirts of the duchess; and indeed and in truth the sound they heard was a most doleful and melancholy one.
<p/>While they were still in uncertainty they saw advancing towards them through the garden two men clad in mourning robes so long and flowing that they trailed upon the ground.
<p/>As they marched they beat two great drums which were likewise draped in black, and beside them came the fife player, black and sombre like the others.
<p/>Following these came a personage of gigantic stature enveloped rather than clad in a gown of the deepest black, the skirt of which was of prodigious dimensions.
<p/>Over the gown, girdling or crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) figure, he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) had a broad baldric which was also black, and from which hung a huge scimitar with a black scabbard and furniture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) face covered with a transparent black veil, through which might be descried a very long beard as white as snow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) came on keeping step to the sound of the drums with great gravity and dignity; and, in short, his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) stature, his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) gait, the sombreness of his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) appearance and his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) following might well have struck with astonishment, as they did, all who beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) without knowing who he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) was.
<p/>With this measured pace and in this guise he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) advanced to kneel before the duke, who, with the others, awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) standing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``this one will do, and I wish the duke to see it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>The duke, however, would not on any account allow him (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) to speak until he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) had risen.
<p/>The prodigious scarecrow obeyed, and standing up, removed the veil from his (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>) face and disclosed the most enormous, the longest, the whitest and the thickest beard that human eyes had ever beheld until that moment, and then fetching up a grave, sonorous voice from the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>) broad, capacious chest, and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>) eyes on the duke, he (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>) said: ``Most high and mighty senor, my name is Trifaldin of the White Beard; I am squire to the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed Duenna, on whose behalf I bear a message to your highness, which is that your magnificence will be pleased to grant her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) leave and permission to come and tell you her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) trouble, which is one of the strangest and most wonderful that the mind most familiar with trouble in the world could have imagined; but first she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) desires to know if the valiant and never vanquished knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, is in this your castle, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) has come in quest of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) on foot and without breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) fast from the kingdom of Kandy to your realms here; a thing which may and ought to be regarded as a miracle or set down to enchantment
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) is even now at the gate of this fortress or plaisance, and only waits for your permission to enter.
<p/>And with that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) coughed, and stroked down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) beard with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) hands, and stood very tranquilly waiting for the response of the duke, which was to this effect: ``Many days ago, worthy squire Trifaldin of the White Beard, we heard of the misfortune of my lady the Countess Trifaldi, whom the enchanters have caused to be called the Distressed Duenna.
<p/>Bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) enter, O stupendous squire, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) that the valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha is here, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) generous disposition she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) may safely promise herself every protection and assistance; and you may tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>), too, that if my aid be necessary it will not be withheld, for I am bound to give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) by my quality of knight, which involves the protection of women of all sorts, especially widowed, wronged, and distressed dames, such as her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) ladyship seems to be.
<p/>On hearing this Trifaldin bent the knee to the ground, and making a sign to the fifer and drummers to strike up, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) turned and marched out of the garden to the same notes and at the same pace as when he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) entered, leaving them all amazed at his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bearing and solemnity.
<p/>Turning to Don Quixote, the duke said, <div class="bookquote">``After all, renowned knight, the mists of malice and ignorance are unable to hide or obscure the light of valour and virtue.
<p/>I say so, because your excellence has been barely six days in this castle, and already the unhappy and the afflicted come in quest of you from lands far distant and remote, and not in coaches or on dromedaries, but on foot and fasting, confident that in that mighty arm they will find a cure for their sorrows and troubles; thanks to your great achievements, which are circulated all over the known earth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish, senor duke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``that blessed ecclesiastic, who at table the other day showed such ill-will and bitter spite against knights-errant, were here now to see with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own eyes whether knights of the sort are needed in the world; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would at any rate learn by experience that those suffering any extraordinary affliction or sorrow, in extreme cases and unusual misfortunes do not go to look for a remedy to the houses of jurists or village sacristans, or to the knight who has never attempted to pass the bounds of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) own town, or to the indolent courtier who only seeks for news to repeat and talk of, instead of striving to do deeds and exploits for others to relate and record.
<p/>Relief in distress, help in need, protection for damsels, consolation for widows, are to be found in no sort of persons better than in knights-errant; and I give unceasing thanks to heaven that I am one, and regard any misfortune or suffering that may befall me in the pursuit of so honourable a calling as endured to good purpose.
<p/>Let this duenna come and ask what she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will, for I will effect her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) relief by the might of my arm and the dauntless resolution of my bold heart.
<p/>The duke and duchess were extremely glad to see how readily Don Quixote fell in with their scheme; but at this moment Sancho observed, <div class="bookquote">``I hope this senora duenna won't be putting any difficulties in the way of the promise of my government; for I have heard a Toledo apothecary, who talked like a goldfinch, say that where duennas were mixed up nothing good could happen.
<p/>I have spoken. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' CHAPTER XXXVII. WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE DISTRESSED DUENNA God bless me, how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hated them, that same apothecary!
<p/>And so what I'm thinking is, if all duennas, of whatever sort or condition they may be, are plagues and busybodies, what must they be that are distressed, like this Countess Three-skirts or Three-tails!--for in my country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it's all one.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, friend Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``since this lady duenna comes in quest of me from such a distant land she (<font color='blue'><b>duenna</b></font>) cannot be one of those the apothecary meant; moreover this is a countess, and when countesses serve as duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses, for in their own houses they are mistresses paramount and have other duennas to wait on them.
<p/>To this Dona Rodriguez, who was present, made answer, <div class="bookquote">``My lady the duchess has duennas in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) service that might be countesses if it was the will of fortune; `but laws go as kings like;' let nobody speak ill of duennas, above all of ancient maiden ones

<p/>But I can tell these walking blocks that we will live in spite of them, and in great houses too, though we die of hunger and cover our flesh, be it delicate or not, with widow's weeds, as one covers or hides a dunghill on a procession day.
<p/>By my faith, if it were permitted me and time allowed, I could prove, not only to those here present, but to all the world, that there is no virtue that is not to be found in a duenna.''

<p/>The duchess asked the duke if it would be proper to go out to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was a countess and a person of rank.

<p/>IS TOLD THE DISTRESSED DUENNA'S TALE OF HER MISFORTUNES Following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as twelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robes apparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long that they allowed only the border of the robe to be seen.
<p/>Behind them came the Countess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Beard</b></font>) by the hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that, had it a nap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea; the tail, or skirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in three points which were borne up by the hands of three pages, likewise dressed in mourning, forming an elegant geometrical figure with the three acute angles made by the three points, from which all who saw the peaked skirt concluded that it must be because of it the countess was called Trifaldi, as though it were Countess of the Three Skirts; and Benengeli says it was so, and that by her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) right name she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) was called the Countess Lobuna, because wolves bred in great numbers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) country; and if, instead of wolves, they had been foxes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Countess</b></font>) would have been called the Countess Zorruna, as it was the custom in those parts for lords to take distinctive titles from the thing or things most abundant in their dominions; this countess, however, in honour of the new fashion of her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) skirt, dropped Lobuna and took up Trifaldi.
<p/>The twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace, their faces being covered with black veils, not transparent ones like Trifaldin's, but so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them.
<p/>As soon as the band of duennas was fully in sight, the duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-moving procession.
<p/>WHEREIN The twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along which the Distressed One advanced, Trifaldin still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) hand. On seeing this the duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote went some twelve paces forward to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) then, kneeling on the ground, said in a voice hoarse and rough, rather than fine and delicate, <div class="bookquote">``May it please your highnesses not to offer such courtesies to this your servant, I should say to this your handmaid, for I am in such distress that I shall never be able to make a proper return, because my strange and unparalleled misfortune has carried off my wits, and I know not whither; but it must be a long way off, for the more I look for them the less I find them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would be wanting in wits, senora countess,'' said the duke, <div class="bookquote">``who did not perceive your worth by your person, for at a glance it may be seen it deserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of polite usage;''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>and raising her (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) up by the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to a seat beside the duchess, who likewise received her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) with great urbanity.
<p/>Don Quixote remained silent, while Sancho was dying to see the features of Trifaldi and one or two of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) many duennas; but there was no possibility of it until they themselves displayed them of their own accord and free will.
<p/>All kept still, waiting to see who would break silence, which the Distressed Duenna did in these words: <div class="bookquote">``I am confident, most mighty lord, most fair lady, and most discreet company, that my most miserable misery will be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generous and condolent in your most valiant bosoms, for it is one that is enough to melt marble, soften diamonds, and mollify the steel of the most hardened hearts in the world; but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing, not to say your ears, I would fain be enlightened whether there be present in this society, circle, or company, that knight immaculatissimus, Don Quixote de la Manchissima, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) squirissimus Panza.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>The Panza is here,'' said Sancho, before anyone could reply, ``and Don Quixotissimus too; and so, most distressedest Duenissima, you may say what you willissimus, for we are all readissimus to do you any servissimus.
<p/>On this Don Quixote rose, and addressing the Distressed Duenna, said, <div class="bookquote">``If your sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge in any hope of relief from the valour or might of any knight-errant, here are mine, which, feeble and limited though they be, shall be entirely devoted to your service.
<p/>I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose calling it is to give aid to the needy of all sorts; and that being so, it is not necessary for you, senora, to make any appeal to benevolence, or deal in preambles, only to tell your woes plainly and straightforwardly: for you have hearers that will know how, if not to remedy them, to sympathise with them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>On hearing this, the Distressed Duenna made as though she (<font color='blue'><b>hearers</b></font>) would throw herself at Don Quixote's feet, and actually did fall before them and said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>hearers</b></font>) strove to embrace them, <div class="bookquote">``Before these feet and legs I cast myself, O unconquered knight, as before, what they are, the foundations and pillars of knight-errantry; these feet I desire to kiss, for upon their steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune, O valorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse the fabulous ones of the Amadises, Esplandians, and Belianises!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then turning from Don Quixote to Sancho Panza, and grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>hearers</b></font>) said, ``O thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant in this present age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than the beard of Trifaldin my companion here of present, well mayest thou boast thyself that, in serving the great Don Quixote, thou art serving, summed up in one, the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in the world.
<p/>I conjure thee, by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness, that thou wilt become my kind intercessor with thy master, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) speedily give aid to this most humble and most unfortunate countess.
<p/>To this Sancho made answer, ``As to my goodness, senora, being as long and as great as your squire's beard, it matters very little to me; may I have my soul well bearded and moustached when it comes to quit this life
<p/>, that's the point; about beards here below I care little or nothing; but without all these blandishments and prayers, I will beg my master -LRB-
<p/>for I know he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) loves me, and, besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) has need of me just now for a certain business-RRB- to help and aid your worship as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) can; unpack your woes and lay them before us, and leave us to deal with them, for we'll be all of one mind.
<p/>The duke and duchess, as it was they who had made the experiment of this adventure, were ready to burst with laughter at all this, and between themselves they commended the clever acting of the Trifaldi, who, returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) seat, said, <div class="bookquote">``Queen Dona Maguncia reigned over the famous kingdom of Kandy, which lies between the great Trapobana and the Southern Sea, two leagues beyond Cape Comorin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was the widow of King Archipiela, her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) lord and husband, and of their marriage they had issue the Princess Antonomasia, heiress of the kingdom; which Princess Antonomasia was reared and brought up under my care and direction,
<p/>Time passed, and the young Antonomasia reached the age of fourteen, and such a perfection of beauty, that nature could not raise it higher.
<p/>Then, it must not be supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) intelligence was childish; she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was as intelligent as she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was fair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) was fairer than all the world; and is so still, unless the envious fates and hard-hearted sisters three have cut for her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) the thread of life.
<p/>But that they have not, for Heaven will not suffer so great a wrong to Earth, as it would be to pluck unripe the grapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface.
<p/>Of this beauty, to which my poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice, countless princes, not only of that country, but of others, were enamoured, and among them a private gentleman, who was at the court, dared to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty, trusting to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) youth, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gallant bearing, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) numerous accomplishments and graces, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quickness and readiness of wit; for I may tell your highnesses, if I am not wearying you, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) played the guitar so as to make it speak, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was, besides, a poet and a great dancer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could make birdcages so well, that by making them alone he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might have gained a livelihood
<p/>, had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found himself reduced to utter poverty; and gifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down a mountain, not to say a tender young girl.
<p/>But all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gallantry, wit, and gaiety, all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) graces and accomplishments, would have been of little or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil, had not the impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first.
<p/>First, the villain and heartless vagabond sought to win my good-will and purchase my compliance, so as to get me, like a treacherous warder, to deliver up to him (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) the keys of the fortress I had in charge.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Trifaldi/Senora Trifaldi</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' I being the oldest and highest in rank of her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mother's duennas. In a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) gained an influence over my mind, and overcame my resolutions with
<p/>I know not what trinkets and jewels he (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) gave me; but it was some verses I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) singing one night from a grating that opened on the street where he (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) lived, that, more than anything else, made me give way and led to my fall; and if I remember rightly they ran thus: From that sweet enemy of mine
<p/>My bleeding heart hath had its wound; And to increase the pain I'm bound To suffer and to make no sign.
<p/>The lines seemed pearls to me and his (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) voice sweet as syrup; and afterwards, I may say ever since then, looking at the misfortune into which I have fallen, I have thought that poets, as Plato advised, ought to be banished from all well-ordered States; at least the amatory ones, for they write verses, not like those of `The Marquis of Mantua,' that delight and draw tears from the women and children, but sharp-pointed conceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns, and like the lightning strike it, leaving the raiment uninjured.
<p/>Another time he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>) sang: Come Death, so subtly veiled that I Thy coming know not, how or when, Lest it should give me life again To find how sweet it is to die.
<p/>And then, when they condescend to compose a sort of verse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy, which they call seguidillas!
<p/>Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks forth, and the body grows restless and all the senses turn quicksilver.
<p/>--and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant when sung and fascinate when written. And so I say, sirs, that these troubadours richly deserve to be banished to the isles of the lizards.
<p/>Though it is not they that are in fault, but the simpletons that extol them, and the fools that believe in them; and had I been the faithful duenna I should have been, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stale conceits would have never moved me, nor should I have been taken in by such phrases as `in death I live,' '
<p/>in ice I burn,' `in flames I shiver,' `hopeless I hope,' 'I go and stay,' and paradoxes of that sort which their writings are full of.
<p/>And then when they promise the Phoenix of Arabia, the crown of Ariadne, the horses of the Sun, the pearls of the South, the gold of Tibar, and the balsam of Panchaia!
<p/>Then it is they give a loose to their pens, for it costs them little to make promises they have no intention or power of fulfilling.
<p/>What madness or folly leads me to speak of the faults of others, when there is so much to be said about my own?
<p/>it was not verses that conquered me, but my own simplicity; it was not music made me yield, but my own imprudence; my own great ignorance and little caution opened the way and cleared the path for Don Clavijo's advances, for that was the name of the gentleman I have referred to; and so, with my help as go-between, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way many a time into the chamber of the deceived Antonomasia -LRB-deceived not by him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) but by me-RRB- under the title of a lawful husband; for, sinner though I was, would not have allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) to approach the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) shoe-sole without being her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) husband.
<p/>But where am I wandering to? Woe is me, unfortunate being! Again, woe is me, hapless that I am! No, no, not that
<p/>But there was one hitch in this case, which was that of inequality of rank, Don Clavijo being a private gentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I said, heiress to the kingdom.
<p/>The entanglement remained for some time a secret, kept hidden by my cunning precautions, until I perceived that a certain expansion of waist in Antonomasia must before long disclose it, the dread of which made us all there take counsel together, and it was agreed that before the mischief came to light, Don Clavijo should demand Antonomasia as his (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) wife before the Vicar, in virtue of an agreement to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in such binding terms that the might of Samson could not have broken it.
<p/>The necessary steps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady's confession; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) confessed everything in full, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) into the custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court.''
<p/>; marriage must come first in any business of this sort that I take in hand. <div class="bookquote">``Are there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho at this, <div class="bookquote">``and poets, and seguidillas?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tongue, and the Distressed One went on to say: <div class="bookquote">``At length, after much questioning and answering, as the princess held to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) story, without changing or varying her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) previous declaration, the Vicar gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) decision in favour of Don Clavijo, and she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) was delivered over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) lawful wife; which the Queen Dona Maguncia, the Princess Antonomasia's mother, so took to heart, that within the space of three days we buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>By every word that Sancho uttered, the duchess was as much delighted as Don Quixote was driven to desperation. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) died, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Senor Squire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``a man in a swoon has been known to be buried before now, in the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was dead; and it struck me that Queen Maguncia ought to have swooned rather than died; because with life a great many things come right, and the princess's folly was not so great that she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) need feel it so keenly.
<p/>If the lady had married some page of hers, or some other servant of the house, as many another has done, so I have heard say, then the mischief would have been past curing.
<p/>But to marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as has been just now described to us--indeed, indeed, though it was a folly, it was not such a great one as you think; for according to the rules of my master here--and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) won't allow me to lie--as of men of letters bishops are made, so of gentlemen knights, specially if they be errant, kings and emperors may be made.
<p/>Thou art right, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for with a knight-errant, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has but two fingers' breadth of good fortune, it is on the cards to become the mightiest lord on earth.
<p/>But let senora the Distressed One proceed; for I suspect she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has got yet to tell us the bitter part of this so far sweet story.
<p/>The bitter is indeed to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said the countess; <div class="bookquote">``and such bitter that colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison.
<p/>The queen, then, being dead, and not in a swoon, we buried her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>); and hardly had we covered her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) with earth, hardly had we said our last farewells, when, quis talia fando temperet a lachrymis?
<p/>over the queen's grave there appeared, mounted upon a wooden horse, the giant Malambruno, Maguncia's first cousin, who besides being cruel is an enchanter; and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), to revenge the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) cousin, punish the audacity of Don Clavijo, and in wrath at the contumacy of Antonomasia, left them both enchanted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) art on the grave itself; she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) being changed into an ape of brass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) into a horrible crocodile of some unknown metal; while between the two there stands a pillar, also of metal, with certain characters in the Syriac language inscribed upon it, which, being translated into Kandian, and now into Castilian, contain the following sentence: `These two rash lovers shall not recover their former shape until the valiant Manchegan comes to do battle with me in single combat; for the Fates reserve this unexampled adventure for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) mighty valour alone.'
<p/>This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) drew from its sheath a huge broad scimitar, and seizing me by the hair he (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) made as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) meant to cut my throat and

<p/>I was terror-stricken, my voice stuck in my throat, and I was in the deepest distress; nevertheless I summoned up my strength as well as I could, and in a trembling and piteous voice I addressed such words to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) as induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) to stay the infliction of a punishment so severe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) then caused all the duennas of the palace, those that are here present, to be brought before him (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>); and after having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence, and denounced duennas, their characters, their evil ways and worse intrigues, laying to the charge of all what I alone was guilty of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) would not visit us with capital punishment, but with others of a slow nature which would be in effect civil death for ever; and the very instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Clavijo</b></font>) ceased speaking
<p/>we all felt the pores of our faces opening, and pricking us, as if with the points of needles. We at once put our hands up to our faces and found ourselves in the state you now see.
<p/>Here the Distressed One and the other duennas raised the veils with which they were covered, and disclosed countenances all bristling with beards, some red, some black, some white, and some grizzled, at which spectacle the duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder.
<p/>Don Quixote and Sancho were overwhelmed with amazement, and the bystanders lost in astonishment, while the Trifaldi went on to say: <div class="bookquote">``Thus did that malevolent villain Malambruno punish us, covering the tenderness and softness of our faces with these rough bristles!
<p/>Would to heaven that he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) had swept off our heads with his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) enormous scimitar instead of obscuring the light of our countenances with these wool-combings that cover us!
<p/>For if we look into the matter, sirs -LRB-and what I am now going to say I would say with eyes flowing like fountains, only that the thought of our misfortune and the oceans they have already wept, keep them as dry as barley spears, and so I say it without tears-RRB-, where, I ask, can a duenna with a beard go to?
<p/>For, if even when she (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) has a smooth skin, and a face tortured by a thousand kinds of washes and cosmetics, she (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) can hardly get anybody to love her (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)

<p/>ought show their gratitude to Cide Hamete, its original author, for the scrupulous care he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) has taken to set before us all its minute particulars, not leaving anything, however trifling it may be, that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) does not make clear and plain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) portrays the thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) reveals the fancies, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) answers implied questions, clears up doubts, sets objections at rest, and, in a word, makes plain the smallest points the most inquisitive can desire to know.
<p/>ADVENTURE AND TO THIS MEMORABLE HISTORY Verily and truly all those who find pleasure in histories like this O renowned author!
<p/>O happy Don Quixote! O famous famous droll Sancho! All and each, may ye live countless ages for the delight and amusement of the dwellers on earth!
<p/>The history goes on to say that when Sancho saw the Distressed One faint he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``I swear by the faith of an honest man and the shades of all my ancestors the Panzas, that never I did see or hear of, nor has my master related or conceived in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mind, such an adventure as this.
<p/>A thousand devils--not to curse thee--take thee, Malambruno, for an enchanter and a giant! Couldst thou find no other sort of punishment for these sinners but bearding them?
<p/>Would it not have been better--it would have been better for them--to have taken off half their noses from the middle upwards, even though they'd have snuffled when they spoke, than to have put beards on them?
<p/>That is the truth, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said one of the twelve; <div class="bookquote">``we have not the money to get ourselves shaved, and so we have, some of us, taken to using sticking-plasters by way of an economical remedy, for by applying them to our faces and plucking them off with a jerk we are left as bare and smooth as the bottom of a stone mortar.
<p/>There are, to be sure, women in Kandy that go about from house to house to remove down, and trim eyebrows, and make cosmetics for the use of the women, but we, the duennas of my lady, would never let them in, for most of them have a flavour of agents that have ceased to be principals; and if we are not relieved by Senor Don Quixote we shall be carried to our graves with beards.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I'll bet they have not the means of paying anybody to shave them.'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I will pluck out my own in the land of the Moors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``if I don't cure yours.
<p/>At this instant the Trifaldi recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) swoon and said, <div class="bookquote">``The chink of that promise, valiant knight, reached my ears in the midst of my swoon, and has been the means of reviving me and bringing back my senses; and so once more I implore you, illustrious errant, indomitable sir, to let your gracious promises be turned into deeds.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Trifaldi/Senora Trifaldi</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``There shall be no delay on my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' Bethink you, senora, of what I must do, for my heart is most eager to serve you.''
<p/>The fact is,'' replied the Distressed One, <div class="bookquote">``it is five thousand leagues, a couple more or less, from this to the kingdom of Kandy, if you go by land; but if you go through the air and in a straight line, it is three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven.
<p/>You must know, too, that Malambruno told me that, whenever fate provided the knight our deliverer, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) himself would send him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) a steed far better and with less tricks than a post-horse; for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) will be that same wooden horse on which the valiant Pierres carried off the fair Magalona; which said horse is guided by a peg he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) forehead that serves for a bridle, and flies through the air with such rapidity that you would fancy the very devils were carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) lent him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to Pierres, who was a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and who made long journeys with him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), and, as has been said, carried off the fair Magalona, bearing her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) through the air on its haunches and making all who beheld them from the earth gape with astonishment; and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) never lent him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) save to those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) loved or those who paid him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) well; and since the great Pierres we know of no one having mounted him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) until now.
<p/>From him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) Malambruno stole him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) magic art, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) has him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) now in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) possession, and makes use of him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) journeys which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) constantly makes through different parts of the world; he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is here to-day, to-morrow in France, and the next day in Potosi; and the best of it is the said horse neither eats nor sleeps nor wears out shoes, and goes at an ambling pace through the air without wings, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) has mounted upon him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) can carry a cup full of water in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) hand without spilling a drop, so smoothly and easily does he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) go, for which reason the fair Magalona enjoyed riding him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) greatly.
<p/>For going smoothly and easily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho at this, <div class="bookquote">``give me my Dapple, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) can't go through the air; but on the ground I'll back him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) against all the amblers in the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this same horse, if so be that Malambruno is disposed to put an end to our sufferings, will be here before us ere the night shall have advanced half an hour; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) announced to me that the sign he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) would give me whereby I might know that I had found the knight
<p/>I was in quest of, would be to send me the horse wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) might be, speedily and promptly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And how many is there room for on this horse?'' asked Sancho.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Distressed One, <div class="bookquote">``one in the saddle, and the other on the croup; and generally these two are knight and squire, when there is no damsel that's being carried off.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Distressed One, <div class="bookquote">``is not the same as Bellerophon's horse that was called Pegasus, or Alexander the Great's, called Bucephalus, or Orlando Furioso's, the name of which was Brigliador, nor yet Bayard, the horse of Reinaldos of Montalvan, nor Frontino like Ruggiero's, nor Bootes or Peritoa, as they say the horses of the sun were called, nor is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggiero</b></font>) called Orelia, like the horse on which the unfortunate Rodrigo, the last king of the Goths, rode to the battle where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodrigo</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodrigo</b></font>) life and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rodrigo</b></font>) kingdom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll bet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``that as they have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) none of these famous names of well-known horses, no more have they given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the name of my master's Rocinante, which for being apt surpasses all that have been mentioned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div>said the bearded countess, <div class="bookquote">``still it fits him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) very well, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is called Clavileno the Swift, which name is in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) being made of wood, with the peg he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) forehead, and with the swift pace at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) travels; and so, as far as name goes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) may compare with the famous Rocinante.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the countess</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' I'd like to know, Senora Distressed One,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``what is the name of this horse?''

<p/>I'd like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Trifaldi/Senora Trifaldi</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``but to fancy I'm going to mount him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), either in the saddle or on the croup, is to ask pears of the elm tree.
<p/>I can hardly keep my seat upon Dapple, and on a pack-saddle softer than silk itself, and here they'd have me hold on upon haunches of plank without pad or cushion of any sort!
<p/>Gad, I have no notion of bruising myself to get rid of anyone's beard; let each one shave himself as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) can; I'm not going to accompany my master on any such long journey; besides, I can't give any help to the shaving of these beards as I can to the disenchantment of my lady Dulcinea.''

<p/>Unfortunate beings that we are, we duennas! O giant Malambruno, though thou art an enchanter, thou art true to thy promises.
<p/>Send us now the peerless Clavileno, that our misfortune may be brought to an end; for if the hot weather sets in and these beards of ours are still there, alas for our lot!''
<p/>The Trifaldi said this in such a pathetic way that she (<font color='blue'><b>giant</b></font>) drew tears from the eyes of all and even Sancho's filled up; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) resolved in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master to the uttermost ends of the earth, if so be the removal of the wool from those venerable countenances depended upon it.
<p/>with it the appointed time for the arrival of the famous horse Clavileno, the non-appearance of which was already beginning to make Don Quixote uneasy, for it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that, as Malambruno was so long about sending it, either he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself was not the knight for whom the adventure was reserved, or else Malambruno did not dare to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in single combat.
<p/>CHAPTER XLI. OF THE ARRIVAL OF CLAVILENO AND THE END OF THIS PROTRACTED ADVENTURE And now night came, and But lo!
<p/>suddenly there came into the garden four wild-men all clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders a great wooden horse.
<p/>They placed it on its feet on the ground, and one of the wild-men said, <div class="bookquote">``Let the knight who has heart for it mount this machine.
<p/>And let the squire, if he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) has one,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the wild-man, <div class="bookquote">``take his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) seat on the croup, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) trust the valiant Malambruno; for by no sword save his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), nor by the malice of any other, shall he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) be assailed.
<p/>It is but to turn this peg the horse has in his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) neck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) will bear them through the air to where Malambruno awaits them; but lest the vast elevation of their course should make them giddy, their eyes must be covered until the horse neighs, which will be the sign of their having completed their journey.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Here Sancho exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I don't mount, for neither have I the heart nor am I a knight.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' With these words, leaving Clavileno behind them, they retired with easy dignity the way they came.
<p/>As soon as the Distressed One saw the horse, almost in tears she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) exclaimed to Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``Valiant knight, the promise of Malambruno has proved trustworthy; the horse has come, our beards are growing, and by every hair in them all of us implore thee to shave and shear us, as it is only mounting him (<font color='blue'><b>Valiant</b></font>) with thy squire and making a happy beginning with your new journey.''

<p/>; well then, that which I look to receive for this government is that you go with your master Don Quixote, and bring this memorable adventure to a conclusion; and whether you return on Clavileno as quickly as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) speed seems to promise, or adverse fortune brings you back on foot travelling as a pilgrim from hostel to hostel and from inn to inn, you will always find your island on your return where you left it, and your islanders with the same eagerness they have always had to receive you as their governor, and my good-will will remain the same; doubt not the truth of this, Senor Sancho, for that would be grievously wronging my disposition to serve you.''

<p/>To this the Trifaldi made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Sancho, you may freely commend yourself to God or whom you will; for Malambruno though an enchanter is a Christian, and works his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) enchantments with great circumspection, taking very good care not to fall out with anyone.''

<p/>This is like the common saying, `You see me with child, and you want me a virgin.' Just as I'm about to go sitting on a bare board, your worship would have me score my backside!
<p/>Let us be off to shave these duennas; and on our return I promise on my word to make such haste to wipe off all that's due as will satisfy your worship;
<p/>Indeed, your worship is not reasonable. I can't say more.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I will comfort myself with that promise, my good Sancho,'' replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and I believe thou
<p/>wilt keep it; for indeed though stupid thou art veracious.''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not voracious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``only peckish; but even if I was a little, still I'd keep my word.
<p/>With this they went back to mount Clavileno, and as they were about to do so Don Quixote said, <div class="bookquote">``Cover thine eyes, Sancho, and mount; for one who sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive us for the sake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving persons who trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); though all should turn out the contrary of what I hope, no malice will be able to dim the glory of having undertaken this exploit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us be off, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for I have taken the beards and tears of these ladies deeply to heart, and I shan't eat a bit to relish it until I have seen them restored to their former smoothness.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Mount, your worship, and blindfold yourself, for if I am to go on the croup, it is plain the rider in the saddle must mount first.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, and, taking a handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) begged the Distressed One to bandage his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes very carefully; but after having them bandaged he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) uncovered them again, saying, <div class="bookquote">``If my memory does not deceive me, I have read in Virgil of the Palladium of Troy, a wooden horse the Greeks offered to the goddess Pallas, which was big with armed knights, who were afterwards the destruction of Troy; so it would be as well to see, first of all, what Clavileno has in his (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>) stomach.
<p/>There is no occasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Distressed One; ``I will be bail for him (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>), and I know that Malambruno has nothing tricky or treacherous about him (<font color='blue'><b>Virgil</b></font>); you may mount without any fear, Senor Don Quixote; on my head be it if any harm befalls you.
<p/>Don Quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) safety would be putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) courage in an unfavourable light; and so, without more words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mounted Clavileno, and tried the peg, which turned easily; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had no stirrups and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) legs hung down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) looked like nothing so much as a figure in some Roman triumph painted or embroidered on a Flemish tapestry.
<p/>Much against the grain, and very slowly, Sancho proceeded to mount, and, after settling himself as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could on the croup, found it rather hard, and not at all soft, and asked the duke if it would be possible to oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with a pad of some kind, or a cushion; even if it were off the couch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lady the duchess, or the bed of one of the pages; as the haunches of that horse were more like marble than wood.
<p/>On this the Trifaldi observed that Clavileno would not bear any kind of harness or trappings, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) best plan would be to sit sideways like a woman, as in that way he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would not feel the hardness so much.
<p/>Sancho did so, and, bidding them farewell, allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes to be bandaged, but immediately afterwards uncovered them again, and looking tenderly and tearfully on those in the garden, bade them help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) present strait with plenty of Paternosters and Ave Marias, that God might provide some one to say as many for them, whenever they found themselves in a similar emergency.
<p/>At this Don Quixote exclaimed, ``Art thou on the gallows, thief, or at thy last moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort?
<p/>Cowardly, spiritless creature, art thou not in the very place the fair Magalona occupied, and from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) descended, not into the grave, but to become Queen of France; unless the histories lie?
<p/>And I who am here beside thee, may I not put myself on a par with the valiant Pierres, who pressed this very spot that I now press?
<p/>Cover thine eyes, cover thine eyes, abject animal, and let not thy fear escape thy lips, at least in my presence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blindfold me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``as you won't let me commend myself or be commended to God, is it any wonder if I am afraid there is a region of devils about here that will carry us off to Peralvillo?
<p/>They were then blindfolded, and Don Quixote, finding himself settled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fingers on it, all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up their voices exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``God guide thee, valiant knight!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' God be with thee, intrepid squire! Now, now ye go cleaving the air more swiftly than an arrow!
<p/>Now ye begin to amaze and astonish all who are gazing at you from the earth! Take care not to wobble about, valiant Sancho!
<p/>Mind thou fall not, for thy fall will be worse than that rash youth's who tried to steer the chariot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) father the Sun!''
<p/>As Sancho heard the voices, clinging tightly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master and winding his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, how do they make out we are going up so high, if their voices reach us here and they seem to be speaking quite close to us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind that, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``for as affairs of this sort, and flights like this are out of the common course of things, you can see and hear as much as you like a thousand leagues off; but don't squeeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me; and really I know not what thou hast to be uneasy or frightened at, for I can safely swear I never mounted a smoother-going steed all the days of my life; one would fancy we never stirred from one place.
<p/>That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for such a strong wind comes against me on this side, that it seems as if people were blowing on me with a thousand pair of bellows;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>which was the case; they were puffing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with a great pair of bellows; for the whole adventure was so well planned by the duke, the duchess, and their majordomo, that nothing was omitted to make it perfectly successful.
<p/>Don Quixote now, feeling the blast, said, <div class="bookquote">``Beyond a doubt, Sancho, we must have already reached the second region of the air, where the hail and snow are generated; the thunder, the lightning, and the thunderbolts are engendered in the third region, and if we go on ascending at this rate, we shall shortly plunge into the region of fire, and I know not how to regulate this peg, so as not to mount up where we shall be burned.
<p/>Banish fear, my friend, for indeed everything is going as it ought, and we have the wind astern. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>And now they began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow that could be easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end of a cane.
<p/>On feeling the heat Sancho said, <div class="bookquote">``May I die if we are not already in that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of my beard has been singed, and I have a mind, senor, to uncover and see whereabouts we are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``remember the true story of the licentiate Torralva that the devils carried flying through the air riding on a stick with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes shut; who in twelve hours reached Rome and dismounted at Torre di Nona, which is a street of the city, and saw the whole sack and storming and the death of Bourbon, and was back in Madrid the next morning, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Torre</b></font>) gave an account of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Torre</b></font>) had seen; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Torre</b></font>) said moreover that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Torre</b></font>) was going through the air, the devil bade him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) open his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) did so, and saw himself so near the body of the moon, so it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could have laid hold of it with his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hand, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) did not dare to look at the earth lest he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) should be seized with giddiness.
<p/>So that, Sancho, it will not do for us to uncover ourselves, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who has us in charge will be responsible for us; and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to enable us to descend at one swoop on the kingdom of Kandy, as the saker or falcon does on the heron, so as to seize it however high it may soar; and though it seems to us not half an hour since we left the garden, believe me we must have travelled a great distance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how that may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``all I know is that if the Senora Magallanes or Magalona was satisfied with this croup, she (<font color='blue'><b>Magalona</b></font>) could not have been very tender of flesh.
<p/>The duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to the conversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it; and now, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and well-contrived adventure, they applied a light to Clavileno's tail with some tow, and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately blew up with a prodigious noise, and brought Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to the ground
<p/>By this time the bearded band of duennas, the Trifaldi and all, had vanished from the garden, and those that remained lay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon.
<p/>Don Quixote and Sancho got up rather shaken, and, looking about them, were filled with amazement at finding themselves in the same garden from which they had started, and seeing such a number of people stretched on the ground; and their astonishment was increased when at one side of the garden they perceived a tall lance planted in the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of green silk a smooth white parchment on which there was the following inscription in large gold letters: ``The illustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha has, by merely attempting it, finished and concluded the adventure of the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno is now satisfied on every point, the chins of the duennas are now smooth and clean, and King Don Clavijo and Queen Antonomasia in their original form; and when the squirely flagellation shall have been completed, the white dove shall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons that persecute her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), and in the arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) beloved mate; for such is the decree of the sage Merlin, arch-enchanter of enchanters.
<p/>As soon as Don Quixote had read the inscription on the parchment he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) perceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of Dulcinea, and returning hearty thanks to heaven that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had with so little danger achieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion the countenances of those venerable duennas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) advanced towards the duke and duchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking the duke by the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, ``Be of good cheer, worthy sir, be of good cheer; it's nothing at all; the adventure is now over and without any harm done, as the inscription fixed on this post shows plainly.
<p/>The duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousness after a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrate about the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder and amazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they pretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality.
<p/>The duke read the placard with half-shut eyes, and then ran to embrace Don Quixote with open arms, declaring him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to be the best knight that had ever been seen in any age.
<p/>Sancho kept looking about for the Distressed One, to see what her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) face was like without the beard, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was as fair as her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) elegant person promised; but they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that, the instant Clavileno descended flaming through the air and came to the ground, the whole band of duennas with the Trifaldi vanished, and that they were already shaved and without a stump left.
<p/>The duchess asked Sancho how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had fared on that long journey, to which Sancho replied, ``I felt, senora, that we were flying through the region of fire, as my master told me, and I wanted to uncover my eyes for a bit; but my master, when I asked leave to uncover myself, would not let me; but as I have a little bit of curiosity about me, and a desire to know what is forbidden and kept from me,
<p/>quietly and without anyone seeing me I drew aside the handkerchief covering my eyes ever so little, close to my nose, and from underneath looked towards the earth, and it seemed to me that it was altogether no bigger than a grain of mustard seed, and that the men walking on it were little bigger than hazel nuts
<p/>To this the duchess said, <div class="bookquote">``Sancho, my friend, mind what you are saying; it seems you could not have seen the earth, but only the men walking on it; for if the earth looked to you like a grain of mustard seed, and each man like a hazel nut, one man alone would have covered the whole earth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but for all that I got a glimpse of a bit of one side of it, and saw it all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' half singed. '' '' ; so you may see how high we must have got to then. '' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, ``with a bit of one side one does not see the whole of what one looks at.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand that way of looking at things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I only know that your ladyship will do well to bear in mind that as we were flying by enchantment
<p/>so I might have seen the whole earth and all the men by enchantment whatever way I looked; and if you won't believe this, no more will you believe that, uncovering myself nearly to the eyebrows, I saw myself so close to the sky that there was not a palm and a half between me and it; and by everything that I can swear by, senora, it is mighty great!
<p/>by God and upon my soul, as in my youth I was a goatherd in my own country, as soon as I saw them I felt a longing to be among them for a little, and if I had not given way to it
<p/>So I come and take, and what do I do? without saying anything to anybody, not even to my master, softly and quietly I got down from Clavileno and amused myself with the goats--which are like violets, like flowers--for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavileno never stirred or moved from one spot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>And while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,'' said the duke, <div class="bookquote">``how did Senor Don Quixote amuse himself?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>And it so happened we came by where the seven goats are, and I think I'd have burst. '' ''
<p/>To which Don Quixote replied, ``As all these things and such like occurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonder that Sancho says what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) does; for my own part I can only say that I did not uncover my eyes either above or below, nor did I see sky or earth or sea or shore.
<p/>I felt that I was passing through the region of the air, and even that I touched that of fire; but that we passed farther I cannot believe; for the region of fire being between the heaven of the moon and the last region of the air, we could not have reached that heaven where the seven goats Sancho speaks of are without being burned; and as we were not burned, either Sancho is lying or Sancho is dreaming.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am neither lying nor dreaming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``only ask me the tokens of those same goats, and you'll see by that whether I'm telling the truth or not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>It is true '' <div class="bookquote">``Tell us them then, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess. '' Two of them,'' said Sancho, ``are green, two blood-red, two blue, and one a mixture of all colours.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An odd sort of goat, that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said the duke; <div class="bookquote">``in this earthly region of ours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such colours.
<p/>That's very plain,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``of course there must be a difference between the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said the duke, <div class="bookquote">``did you see any he-goat among those goats?''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho;
<p/>They did not care to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) anything more about his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) journey, for they saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an account of everything that went on there, without having ever stirred from the garden.
<p/>Such, in short, was the end of the adventure of the Distressed Duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not only for the time being, but for all their lives, and Sancho something to talk about for ages, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lived so long; but Don Quixote, coming close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ear, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``Sancho, as you would have us believe what you saw in heaven, I require you to believe me as to what I saw in the cave of Montesinos; I say no more.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I have heard say that none ever passed the horns of the moon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER XLII. OF THE COUNSELS
<p/>The duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll result of the adventure of the Distressed One, that they resolved to carry on the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for making it all pass for reality.
<p/>So having laid their plans and given instructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) government of the promised island, the next day, that following Clavileno's flight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to go and be governor, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) islanders were already looking out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) as for the showers of
<p/>May. Sancho made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) an obeisance, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ever since I came down from heaven, and from the top of it beheld the earth, and saw how little it is, the great desire I had to be a governor has been partly cooled in me; for what is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed, or what dignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as big as hazel nuts; for, so far as I could see, there were no more on the whole earth?
<p/>If your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so small a bit of heaven, were it no more than half a league, I'd rather have it than the best island in the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Recollect, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div>said the duke, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot give a bit of heaven, no not so much as the breadth of my nail, to anyone; rewards and favours of that sort are reserved for God alone.
<p/>What I can give I give you, and that is a real, genuine island, compact, well proportioned, and uncommonly fertile and fruitful, where, if you know how to use your opportunities, you may, with the help of the world's riches, gain those of heaven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/>Well then,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``let the island come; and I'll try and be such a governor, that in spite of scoundrels I'll go to heaven; and it's not from any craving to quit my own humble condition or better myself, but from the desire I have to try what it tastes like to be a governor.

<p/>If you once make trial of it, Sancho,'' said the duke, <div class="bookquote">``you'll eat your fingers off after the government, so sweet a thing is it to command and be obeyed.
<p/>Depend upon it when your master comes to be emperor -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will beyond a doubt from the course his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) affairs are taking-RRB-, it will be no easy matter to wrest the dignity from him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will be sore and sorry at heart to have been so long without becoming one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``it is my belief it's a good thing to be in command, if it's only over a drove of cattle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>May I be buried with you, Sancho,'' said the duke, <div class="bookquote">``but you know everything; I hope you will make as good a governor as your sagacity promises; and that is all I have to say; and now remember to-morrow is the day you must set out for the government of the island, and this evening they will provide you with the proper attire for you to wear, and all things requisite for your departure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/>That's true,'' said the duke; <div class="bookquote">``but one's dress must be suited to the office or rank one holds; for it would not do for a jurist to dress like a soldier, or a soldier like a priest.
<p/>You, Sancho, shall go partly as a lawyer, partly as a captain, for, in the island I am giving you, arms are needed as much as letters, and letters as much as arms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duke</b></font>)</div><p/>Of letters I know but little,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for I don't even know the A B C; but it is enough for me to have the Christus in my memory to be a good governor.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let them dress me as they like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``however I'm dressed I'll be Sancho Panza. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' As for arms, I'll handle those they give me till I drop, and then, God be my help!''
<p/>Here Don Quixote joined them; and learning what passed, and how soon Sancho was to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) government, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with the duke's permission took him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) by the hand, and retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) room with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) for the purpose of giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) advice as to how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was to demean himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) office.
<p/>As soon as they had entered the chamber he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) closed the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and almost by force made Sancho sit down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and in a quiet tone thus addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I give infinite thanks to heaven, friend Sancho, that, before I have met with any good luck, fortune has come forward to meet thee.
<p/>I who counted upon my good fortune to discharge the recompense of thy services, find myself still waiting for advancement, while thou, before the time, and contrary to all reasonable expectation, seest thyself blessed in the fulfillment of thy desires.
<p/>Some will bribe, beg, solicit, rise early, entreat, persist, without attaining the object of their suit; while another comes, and without knowing why or wherefore, finds himself invested with the place or office so many have sued for; and here it is that the common saying, `There is good luck as well as bad luck in suits,' applies.
<p/>Thou, who, to my thinking, art beyond all doubt a dullard, without early rising or night watching or taking any trouble, with the mere breath of knight-errantry that has breathed upon thee, seest thyself without more ado governor of an island, as though it were a mere matter of course.
<p/>This I say, Sancho, that thou attribute not the favour thou hast received to thine own merits, but give thanks to heaven that disposes matters beneficently, and secondly thanks to the great power the profession of knight-errantry contains in itself.
<p/>With a heart, then, inclined to believe what I have said to thee, attend, my son, to thy Cato here who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guide to direct and pilot thee to a safe haven out of this stormy sea wherein thou art about to ingulf thyself; for offices and great trusts are nothing else but a mighty gulf of troubles.
<p/>First of all, my son, thou must fear God, for in the fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is wisdom, and being wise thou canst not err in aught.
<p/>Secondly, thou must keep in view what thou art, striving to know thyself, the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagine.
<p/>If thou knowest thyself, it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up like the frog that strove to make himself as large as the ox; if thou dost, the recollection of having kept pigs in thine own country will serve as the ugly feet for the wheel of thy folly.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``but that was when I was a boy; afterwards when I was something more of a man it was geese I kept, not pigs.
<p/>But to my thinking that has nothing to do with it; for all who are governors don't come of a kingly stock.''

<p/>Glory in thy humble birth, Sancho, and be not ashamed of saying thou art peasant-born; for when it is seen thou art not ashamed no one will set himself to put thee to the blush; and pride thyself rather upon being one of lowly virtue than a lofty sinner.
<p/>Countless are they who, born of mean parentage, have risen to the highest dignities, pontifical and imperial, and of the truth of this I could give thee instances enough to weary thee.
<p/>, thou wilt have no cause to envy those who have princely and lordly ones, for blood is an inheritance, but virtue an acquisition, and virtue has in itself alone a worth that blood does not possess.
<p/>This being so, if perchance anyone of thy kinsfolk should come to see thee when thou art in thine island, thou art not to repel or slight him (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>), but on the contrary to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>), entertain him (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>), and make much of him (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>); for in so doing thou wilt be approved of heaven -LRB-which is not pleased that any should despise what it hath made-RRB-, and wilt comply with the laws of well-ordered nature.
<p/>If thou carriest thy wife with thee -LRB-and it is not well for those that administer governments to be long without their wives-RRB-, teach and instruct her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and strive to smooth down her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) natural roughness; for all that may be gained by a wise governor may be lost and wasted by a boorish stupid wife.
<p/>If perchance thou art left a widower--a thing which may happen--and in virtue of thy office seekest a consort of higher degree, choose not one to serve thee for a hook, or for a fishing-rod, or for the hood of thy `won't have it;' for verily, I tell thee, for all the judge's wife receives, the husband will be held accountable at the general calling to account; where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will have repay in death fourfold, items that in life he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) regarded as naught.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Remember, Sancho, if thou make virtue thy aim, and take a pride in doing virtuous actions ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' '' ''
<p/>Let the tears of the poor man find with thee more compassion, but not more justice, than the pleadings of the rich.
<p/>Strive to lay bare the truth, as well amid the promises and presents of the rich man, as amid the sobs and entreaties of the poor.
<p/>Never go by arbitrary law, which is so much favoured by ignorant men who plume themselves on cleverness. '' '' ''
<p/>When equity may and should be brought into play, press not the utmost rigour of the law against the guilty; for the reputation of the stern judge stands not higher than that of the compassionate.
<p/>If perchance thou permittest the staff of justice to swerve, let it be not by the weight of a gift, but by that of mercy.
<p/>If it should happen to thee to give judgment in the cause of one who is thine enemy, turn thy thoughts away from thy injury and fix them on the justice of the case.
<p/>Let not thine own passion blind thee in another man's cause; for the errors thou wilt thus commit will be most frequently irremediable; or if not, only to be remedied at the expense of thy good name and even of thy fortune.
<p/>If any handsome woman come to seek justice of thee, turn away thine eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tears and thine ears from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lamentations, and consider deliberately the merits of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) demand, if thou wouldst not have thy reason swept away by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) weeping, and thy rectitude by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sighs.
<p/>Abuse not by word him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whom thou hast to punish in deed, for the pain of punishment is enough for the unfortunate without the addition of thine objurgations.
<p/>Bear in mind that the culprit who comes under thy jurisdiction is but a miserable man subject to all the propensities of our depraved nature, and so far as may be in thy power show thyself lenient and forbearing; for though the attributes of God are all equal, to our eyes that of mercy is brighter and loftier than that of justice.
<p/>If thou followest these precepts and rules, Sancho, thy days will be long, thy fame eternal, thy reward abundant, thy felicity unutterable; thou wilt marry thy children as thou wouldst; they and thy grandchildren will bear titles; thou wilt live in peace and concord with all men; and, when life draws to a close, death will come to thee in calm and ripe old age, and the light and loving hands of thy great-grandchildren will close thine eyes.
<p/>What I have thus far addressed to thee are instructions for the adornment of thy mind; listen now to those which tend to that of the body.
<p/>'' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' CHAPTER XLIII. OF THE SECOND SET OF COUNSELS DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO
<p/>Who, hearing the foregoing discourse of Don Quixote, would not have set him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) down for a person of great good sense and greater rectitude of purpose?
<p/>But, as has been frequently observed in the course of this great history, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) only talked nonsense when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) touched on chivalry, and in discussing all other subjects showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had a clear and unbiassed understanding; so that at every turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) acts gave the lie to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) intellect, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) intellect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) acts; but in the case of these second counsels that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) gave Sancho, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) showed himself to have a lively turn of humour, and displayed conspicuously his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wisdom, and also his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) folly.
<p/>Sancho listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with the deepest attention, and endeavoured to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) counsels in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) memory, like one who meant to follow them and by their means bring the full promise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) government to a happy issue.
<p/>Don Quixote, then, went on to say: <div class="bookquote">``With regard to the mode in which thou shouldst govern thy person and thy house, Sancho, the first charge I have to give thee is to be clean, and to cut thy nails, not letting them grow as some do, whose ignorance makes them fancy that long nails are an ornament to their hands, as if those excrescences they neglect to cut were nails, and not the talons of a lizard-catching kestrel--a filthy and unnatural abuse.
<p/>Go not ungirt and loose, Sancho; for disordered attire is a sign of an unstable mind, unless indeed the slovenliness and slackness is to be set down to craft, as was the common opinion in the case of Julius Caesar.
<p/>Ascertain cautiously what thy office may be worth; and if it will allow thee to give liveries to thy servants, give them respectable and serviceable, rather than showy and gay ones, and divide them between thy servants and the poor; that is to say, if thou canst clothe six pages, clothe three and three poor men, and thus thou wilt have pages for heaven and pages for earth; the vainglorious never think of this new mode of giving liveries.
<p/>Eat not garlic nor onions, lest they find out thy boorish origin by the smell; walk slowly and speak deliberately, but not in such a way as to make it seem thou art listening to thyself, for all affectation is bad.
<p/>Dine sparingly and sup more sparingly still; for the health of the whole body is forged in the workshop of the stomach.
<p/>PANZA ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' Be temperate in drinking, bearing in mind that wine in excess keeps neither secrets nor promises.
<p/>'' Take care, Sancho, not to chew on both sides, and not to eruct in anybody's presence. '' <div class="bookquote">``Eruct!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what that means.
<p/>To eruct, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``means to belch, and that is one of the filthiest words in the Spanish language, though a very expressive one; and therefore nice folk have had recourse to the Latin, and instead of belch say eruct, and instead of belches say eructations; and
<p/>if some do not understand these terms it matters little, for custom will bring them into use in the course of time, so that they will be readily understood; this is the way a language is enriched; custom and the public are all-powerful there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In truth, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``one of the counsels and cautions I mean to bear in mind shall be this, not to belch, for I'm constantly doing it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Eruct, Sancho, not belch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote. '' Eruct, I shall say henceforth, and I swear not to forget it,'' said Sancho.
<p/>Likewise, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote, ``thou must not mingle such a quantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost; for though proverbs are short maxims, thou dost drag them in so often by the head and shoulders that they savour more of nonsense than of maxims.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God alone can cure that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for I have more proverbs in me than a book, and when I speak they come so thick together into my mouth that they fall to fighting among themselves to get out
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' ; that's why my tongue lets fly the first that come, though they may not be pat to the purpose.
<p/>But I'll take care henceforward to use such as befit the dignity of my office; for `in a house where there's plenty, supper is soon cooked,' and `he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who binds does not wrangle,' and `the bell-ringer's in a safe berth,' and `giving and keeping require brains.'''
<p/>'' That's it, Sancho!'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``pack, tack, string proverbs together; nobody is hindering thee! ' My mother beats me, and I go on with my tricks.'
<p/>I am bidding thee avoid proverbs, and here in a second thou hast shot out a whole litany of them, which have as much to do with what we are talking about as `over the hills of Ubeda.'
<p/>Mind, Sancho, I do not say that a proverb aptly brought in is objectionable; but to pile up and string together proverbs at random makes conversation dull and vulgar.
<p/>When thou ridest on horseback, do not go lolling with thy body on the back of the saddle, nor carry thy legs stiff or sticking out from the horse's belly, nor yet sit so loosely that one would suppose thou wert on Dapple; for the seat on a horse makes gentlemen of some and grooms of others.
<p/>Be moderate in thy sleep; for he (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) who does not rise early does not get the benefit of the day; and remember, Sancho, diligence is the mother of good fortune, and indolence, its opposite, never yet attained the object of an honest ambition.
<p/>The last counsel I will give thee now, though it does not tend to bodily improvement, I would have thee carry carefully in thy memory, for I believe it will be no less useful to thee than those I have given thee already, and it is this--never engage in a dispute about families, at least in the way of comparing them one with another; for necessarily one of those compared will be better than the other, and thou wilt be hated by the one thou hast disparaged, and get nothing in any shape from the one thou hast exalted.
<p/>Thy attire shall be hose of full length, a long jerkin, and a cloak a trifle longer; loose breeches by no means, for they are becoming neither for gentlemen nor for governors.
<p/>For the present, Sancho, this is all that has occurred to me to advise thee; as time goes by and occasions arise my instructions shall follow, if thou take care to let me know how thou art circumstanced.''

<p/>For no one should quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) governor, or him (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) in authority over him (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) will come off the worst, as he (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) does who puts his (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) finger between two back and if they are not back teeth it makes no difference, so long as they are teeth; and to whatever the governor may say there's no answer, any more than to `get out of my house' and `what do you want with my wife?'

<p/>But if your worship looks into it, you will see it was your worship alone that put me on to this business of governing; for I know no more about the government of islands than a buzzard; and if there's any reason to think that because of my being a governor the devil will get hold of me, I'd rather go Sancho to heaven than governor to hell.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, '' '' CHAPTER XLIV. HOW SANCHO PANZA WAS CONDUCTED TO HIS (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) GOVERNMENT, AND OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL
<p/>It is stated, they say, in the true original of this history, that when Cide Hamete came to write this chapter, his (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) interpreter did not translate it as he (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) wrote it--that is, as a kind of complaint
<p/>the Moor made against himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so little variety as this of Don Quixote, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found himself forced to speak perpetually of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and Sancho, without venturing to indulge in digressions and episodes more serious and more interesting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, too, that to go on, mind, hand, pen always restricted to writing upon one single subject, and speaking through the mouths of a few characters, was intolerable drudgery, the result of which was never equal to the author's labour, and that to avoid this he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) had in the First Part availed himself of the device of novels, like <div class="bookquote">``The Ill-advised Curiosity,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``The Captive Captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which stand, as it were, apart from the story; the others are given there being incidents which occurred to Don Quixote himself and could not be omitted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) also thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) says, that many, engrossed by the interest attaching to the exploits of Don Quixote, would take none in the novels, and pass them over hastily or impatiently without noticing the elegance and art of their composition, which would be very manifest were they published by themselves and not as mere adjuncts to the crazes of Don Quixote or the simplicities of Sancho.
<p/>Therefore in this Second Part he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thought it best not to insert novels, either separate or interwoven, but only episodes, something like them, arising out of the circumstances the facts present; and even these sparingly, and with no more words than suffice to make them plain; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) confines and restricts himself to the narrow limits of the narrative, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) has ability; capacity, and brains enough to deal with the whole universe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) requests that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) labours may not be despised, and that credit be given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), not alone for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) writes, but for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) has refrained from writing.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) goes on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) story, saying that the day Don Quixote gave the counsels to Sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) handed them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in writing so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might get some one to read them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>They had scarcely, however, been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) let them drop, and they fell into the hands of the duke, who showed them to the duchess and they were both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of Don Quixote.
<p/>To carry on the joke, then, the same evening they despatched Sancho with a large following to the village that was to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) for an island.
<p/>It happened that the person who had him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in charge was a majordomo of the duke's, a man of great discretion and humour--and there can be no humour without discretion--and the same who played the part of the Countess Trifaldi in the comical way that has been already described; and thus qualified, and instructed by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master and mistress as to how to deal with Sancho, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) carried out their scheme admirably.
<p/>Now it came to pass that as soon as Sancho saw this majordomo he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seemed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) features to recognise those of the Trifaldi, and turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), ``Senor, either the devil will carry me off, here on this spot, righteous and believing, or your worship will own to me that the face of this majordomo of the duke's here is the very face of the Distressed One.
<p/>Don Quixote regarded the majordomo attentively, and having done so, said to Sancho, ``There is no reason why the devil should carry thee off, Sancho, either righteous or believing--and what thou meanest by that
<p/>I know not; the face of the Distressed One is that of the majordomo, but for all that the majordomo is not the Distressed One; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) being so would involve a mighty contradiction; but this is not the time for going into questions of the sort, which would be involving ourselves in an inextricable labyrinth.
<p/>Believe me, my friend, we must pray earnestly to our Lord that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) deliver us both from wicked wizards and enchanters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no joke, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for before this I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) speak, and it seemed exactly as if the voice of the Trifaldi was sounding in my ears.
<p/>Well, I'll hold my peace; but I'll take care to be on the look-out henceforth for any sign that may be seen to confirm or do away with this suspicion.
<p/>Thou wilt do well, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and thou wilt let me know all thou discoverest, and all that befalls thee in thy government.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was dressed in the garb of a lawyer, with a gaban of tawny watered camlet over all and a montera cap of the same material, and mounted a la gineta upon a mule.
<p/>Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), in accordance with the duke's orders, followed Dapple with brand new ass-trappings and ornaments of silk, and from time to time Sancho turned round to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass, so well pleased to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would not have changed places with the emperor of Germany.
<p/>On taking leave he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) kissed the hands of the duke and duchess and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's blessing, which Don Quixote gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with tears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) received blubbering.
<p/>Let worthy Sancho go in peace, and good luck to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), Gentle Reader; and look out for two bushels of laughter, which the account of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) behaved himself in office will give thee.
<p/>In the meantime turn thy attention to what happened his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master the same night, and if thou dost not laugh thereat, at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin; for Don Quixote's adventures must be honoured either with wonder or with laughter.
<p/>It is recorded, then, that as soon as Sancho had gone, Don Quixote felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) loneliness, and had it been possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to revoke the mandate and take away the government from him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have done so.
<p/>The duchess observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) dejection and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was melancholy; because, she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) said, if it was for the loss of Sancho, there were squires, duennas, and damsels in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) house who would wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) full satisfaction.
<p/>The truth is, senora,'' replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that I do feel the loss of Sancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad; and of all the offers your excellence makes me, I accept only the good-will with which they are made, and as to the remainder I entreat of your excellence to permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in my chamber.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Senor Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``that must not be; four of my damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait upon you.

They, or anything like them, shall as soon enter my chamber as fly.
<p/>If your highness wishes to gratify me still further, though I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait upon myself in my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinations and my virtue, and I do not wish to break this rule through the generosity your highness is disposed to display towards me; and, in short, I will sleep in my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undress me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say no more, Senor Don Quixote, say no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess; ``I assure you I will give orders that not even a fly, not to say a damsel, shall enter your room.
<p/>I am not the one to undermine the propriety of Senor Don Quixote, for it strikes me that among his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) many virtues the one that is pre-eminent is that of modesty.
<p/>Your worship may undress and dress in private and in your own way, as you please and when you please, for there will be no one to hinder you; and in your chamber you will find all the utensils requisite to supply the wants of one who sleeps with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) door locked, to the end that no natural needs compel you to open it.
<p/>May the great Dulcinea del Toboso live a thousand years, and may her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) fame extend all over the surface of the globe, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) deserves to be loved by a knight so valiant and so virtuous; and may kind heaven infuse zeal into the heart of our governor Sancho Panza to finish off his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) discipline speedily, so that the world may once more enjoy the beauty of so grand a lady.
<p/>To which Don Quixote replied, <div class="bookquote">``Your highness has spoken like what you are; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and Dulcinea will be more fortunate, and better known to the world by the praise of your highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earth could bestow upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, well, Senor Don Quixote,'' said the duchess, it is nearly supper-time, and the duke is probably waiting; come let us go to supper, and retire to rest early, for the journey you made yesterday from Kandy was not such a short one but that it must have caused you some fatigue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel none, senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``for I would go so far as to swear to your excellence that in all my life I never mounted a quieter beast, or a pleasanter paced one, than Clavileno; and I don't know what could have induced Malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so gentle, and burn it so recklessly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess repenting others</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``repenting of the evil he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had done to the Trifaldi and company, and others, and the crimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must have committed as a wizard and enchanter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) resolved to make away with all the instruments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) craft; and so burned Clavileno as the chief one, and that which mainly kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) restless, wandering from land to land; and by its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great Don Quixote of La Mancha is established for ever.
<p/>Don Quixote renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thanks to the duchess; and having supped, retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chamber alone, refusing to allow anyone to enter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fear of encountering temptations that might lead or drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chaste fidelity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady Dulcinea; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had always present to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mind the virtue of Amadis, that flower and mirror of knights-errant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) locked the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and by the light of two wax candles undressed himself, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stockings--O disaster unworthy of such a personage!--there came a burst, not of sighs, or anything belying his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) delicacy or good breeding, but of some two dozen stitches in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stockings, that made it look like a window-lattice.
<p/>The worthy gentleman was beyond measure distressed, and at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have given an ounce of silver to have had half a drachm of green silk there; I say green silk, because the stockings were green.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess repenting others</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' Here Cide Hamete exclaimed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was writing, <div class="bookquote">``O poverty, poverty! I know not what could have possessed the great Cordovan poet to call thee `holy gift ungratefully received.'
<p/>Although a Moor, I know well enough from the intercourse I have had with Christians that holiness consists in charity, humility, faith, obedience, and poverty; but for all that, I say he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) must have a great deal of godliness who can find any satisfaction in being poor; unless, indeed, it be the kind of poverty one of their greatest saints refers to, saying, `possess all things as though ye possessed them not;' which is what they call poverty in spirit.
<p/>But thou, that other poverty--for it is of thee I am speaking now-- why dost thou love to fall out with gentlemen and men of good birth more than with other people?
<p/>Why dost thou compel them to smear the cracks in their shoes, and to have the buttons of their coats, one silk, another hair, and another glass?
<p/>Why must their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-From this we may perceive the antiquity of starch and crimped ruffs.-RRB-

<p/>Poor fellow, I say, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) nervous honour, fancying they perceive a league off the patch on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shoe, the sweat-stains on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hat, the shabbiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cloak, and the hunger of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) stomach!''
<p/>All this was brought home to Don Quixote by the bursting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stitches; however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) comforted himself on perceiving that Sancho had left behind a pair of travelling boots, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) resolved to wear the next day.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, as much because he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) missed Sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stockings, the stitches of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would have even taken up with silk of another colour, which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a gentleman can show in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) never-failing embarrassments.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) put out the candles; but the night was warm and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not sleep; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bed and opened slightly a grated window that looked out on a beautiful garden, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) perceived and heard people walking and talking in the garden.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) goes on: ``Poor gentleman of good family! He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) set himself to listen attentively, and those below raised their voices so that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could hear these words:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Urge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever since this stranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), I cannot sing but only weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, and I would not for all the wealth of the world that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found us here; and even if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain, if this strange AEneas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me, sleeps on and wakens not to hear it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heed not that, dear Altisidora,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied a voice; <div class="bookquote">``the duchess is no doubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart and disturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) open the grated window of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) chamber, so he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer, in a low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if the duchess hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not the point, Emerencia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Altisidora</b></font>)</div>replied Altisidora, <div class="bookquote">``it is that I would not that my singing should lay bare my heart, and that I should be thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighty power of love; but come what may; better a blush on the cheeks than a sore in the heart;''  (<font color='red'><b>Altisidora</b></font>)</div>and here a harp softly touched made itself heard.
<p/>for immediately the countless adventures like this, with windows, gratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, and languishings, that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had read of in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) trashy books of chivalry, came to his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) at once concluded that some damsel of the duchess's was in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), and that her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) modesty forced her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) passion secret.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) trembled lest he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) should fall, and made an inward resolution not to yield; and commending himself with all his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) might and soul to his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) lady Dulcinea he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) mind to listen to the music; and to let them know he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was there he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were not a little delighted, for all they wanted was that Don Quixote should hear them.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) listened to all this Don Quixote was in a state of breathless amazement, So having tuned the harp, Altisidora, running her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) hand across the strings, began this ballad:
<p/>O thou that art above in bed, Between the holland sheets, A-lying there from night till morn, With outstretched legs asleep
<p/>; O thou, most valiant knight of all The famed Manchegan breed, Of purity and virtue more Than gold of Araby; Give ear unto a suffering maid, Well-grown but evil-starr'd, For those two suns of thine have lit A fire within her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Adventures seeking thou dost rove, To others bringing woe; Thou scatterest wounds, but, ah, the balm To heal them dost withhold!
<p/>Say, valiant youth, and so may God Thy enterprises speed , Didst thou the light mid Libya's sands Or Jaca's rocks first see?
<p/>Did scaly serpents give thee suck? Who nursed thee when a babe? Wert cradled in the forest rude, Or gloomy mountain cave?
<p/>O Dulcinea may be proud, That plump and lusty maid; For she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) alone hath had the power A tiger fierce to tame.
<p/>Fain would I change with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and give A petticoat to boot, The best and bravest that I have, All trimmed with gold galloon.
<p/>O for to be the happy fair Thy mighty arms enfold, Or even sit beside thy bed And scratch thy dusty poll!
<p/>I rave,--to favours such as these Unworthy to aspire; Thy feet to tickle were enough For one so mean as I.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) for this shall famous be From Tagus to Jarama, From Manzanares to Genil, From Duero to Arlanza. What caps, what slippers silver-laced, Would I on thee bestow!
<p/>And I would give thee pearls that should As big as oak-galls show; So matchless big that each might well Be called the great <div class="bookquote">``Alone.
<p/>What damask breeches make for thee; What fine long holland cloaks! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Manchegan Nero, look not down From thy Tarpeian Rock Upon this burning heart, nor add The fuel of thy wrath.
<p/>A virgin soft and young am I, Not yet fifteen years old; -LRB-I'm only three months past fourteen, I swear upon my soul-RRB-.
<p/>I hobble not nor do I limp, All blemish I'm without, And as I walk my lily locks Are trailing on the ground.
<p/>And though my nose be rather flat, And though my mouth be wide, My teeth like topazes exalt My beauty to the sky.
<p/>Thou knowest that my voice is sweet , That is if thou dost hear; And I am moulded in a form Somewhat below the mean.
<p/>These charms, and many more, are thine, Spoils to thy spear and bow all; A damsel of this house am I,
<p/>Here the lay of the heart-stricken Altisidora came to an end, while the warmly wooed Don Quixote began to feel alarm; and with a deep sigh he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``O that I should be such an unlucky knight that no damsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me!
<p/>By name Altisidora. O that the peerless Dulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) enjoy my incomparable constancy in peace!
<p/>What would ye with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), ye queens? Why do ye persecute her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), ye empresses? Why ye pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), ye virgins of from fourteen to fifteen?
<p/>Leave the unhappy being to triumph, rejoice and glory in the lot love has been pleased to bestow upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) in surrendering my heart and yielding up my soul to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>).
<p/>Ye love-smitten host, know that to Dulcinea only I am dough and sugar-paste, flint to all others; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) I am honey, for you aloes.
<p/>Nature sent me into the world to be hers and no other's; Altisidora may weep or sing, the lady for whose sake they belaboured me in the castle of the enchanted Moor may give way to despair, but I must be Dulcinea's, boiled or roast, pure, courteous, and chaste, in spite of all the magic-working powers on earth.
<p/>For me Dulcinea alone is beautiful, wise, virtuous, graceful, and high-bred, and all others are ill-favoured, foolish, light, and low-born. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And with that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) shut the window with a bang, and, as much out of temper and out of sorts as if some great misfortune had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>), stretched himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) bed, where we will leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) for the present, as the great Sancho Panza, who is about to set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) famous government, now demands our attention.
<p/>OF HOW THE GREAT SANCHO PANZA TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) ISLAND, AND OF HOW HE (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) MADE A BEGINNING IN GOVERNING O perpetual discoverer of the antipodes, torch of the world, eye of heaven, sweet stimulator of the water-coolers!
<p/>Thimbraeus here, Phoebus there, now archer, now physician, father of poetry, inventor of music; thou that always risest and, notwithstanding appearances, never settest!
<p/>To thee, O Sun, by whose aid man begetteth man, to thee I appeal to help me and lighten the darkness of my wit that I may be able to proceed with scrupulous exactitude in giving an account of the great Sancho Panza's government; for without thee I feel myself weak, feeble, and uncertain.
<p/>To come to the point, then--Sancho with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) attendants arrived at a village of some thousand inhabitants, and one of the largest the duke possessed.
<p/>They informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that it was called the island of Barataria, either because the name of the village was Baratario, or because of the joke by way of which the government had been conferred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>On reaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one, the municipality came forth to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), the bells rang out a peal, and the inhabitants showed every sign of general satisfaction; and with great pomp they conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to the principal church to give thanks to God, and then with burlesque ceremonies they presented him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with the keys of the town, and acknowledged him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as perpetual governor of the island of Barataria.
<p/>The costume, the beard, and the fat squat figure of the new governor astonished all those who were not in on the secret, and even all who were, and they were not a few.
<p/>Finally, leading him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) out of the church they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) to the judgment seat and seated him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) on it, and the duke's majordomo said to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), ``It is an ancient custom in this island, senor governor, that he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) who comes to take possession of this famous island is bound to answer a question which shall be put to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), and which must be a somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) answer the people take the measure of their new governor's wit, and hail with joy or deplore his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) arrival accordingly.
<p/>While the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at several large letters inscribed on the wall opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seat, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not read he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) asked what that was that was painted on the wall.
<p/>The answer was, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, there is written and recorded the day on which your lordship took possession of this island, and the inscription says, `This day, the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Senor Don Sancho Panza took possession of this island; many years may he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) enjoy it.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/>Your lordship,'' replied the majordomo; <div class="bookquote">``for no other Panza but the one who is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island.''
 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, let me tell you, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``I haven't got the `Don,' nor has any one of my family ever had it; my name is plain Sancho Panza, and Sancho was my father's name, and Sancho was my grandfather's
<p/>CHAPTER XLV. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' And whom do they call Don Sancho Panza? '' asked Sancho. '' and they were all Panzas, without any Dons or Donas tacked on
<p/>; I suspect that in this island there are more Dons than stones; but never mind; God knows what I mean, and maybe if my government lasts four days I'll weed out these Dons that no doubt are as great a nuisance as the midges, they're so plenty.
<p/>Let the majordomo go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) question, and I'll give the best answer I can, whether the people deplore or not.
<p/>'' At this instant there came into court two old men, one carrying a cane by way of a walking-stick, and
<p/>the one who had no stick said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, some time ago I lent this good man ten gold-crowns in gold to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a service, on the condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to return them to me whenever I should ask for them.
<p/>A long time passed before I asked for them, for I would not put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to any greater straits to return them than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in when I lent them to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was growing careless about payment I asked for them once and several times; and not only will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not give them back, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) denies that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owes them, and says I never lent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any such crowns; or if I did, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repaid them; and I have no witnesses either of the loan, or the payment, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never paid me; I want your worship to put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) oath, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swears he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned them to me
<p/>I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the debt here and before God.''  (<font color='red'><b>court men</b></font>)</div>'' What say you to this, good old man, you with the stick?'' said Sancho.
<p/>To which the old man replied, <div class="bookquote">``I admit, senor, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lent them to me; but let your worship lower your staff, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) leaves it to my oath, I'll swear that I gave them back, and paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) really and truly.
<p/>The governor lowered the staff, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) did so the old man who had the stick handed it to the other old man to hold for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swore, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way; and then laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on the cross of the staff, saying that it was true the ten crowns that were demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been lent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hand given them back into the hand of the other, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), not recollecting it, was always asking for them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said that no doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) debtor had told the truth, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be an honest man and a good Christian, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) himself must have forgotten when and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) back the crowns; and that from that time forth he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would make no further demand upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Seeing this the great governor asked the creditor what answer he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) had to make to what his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) opponent said. The debtor took his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) stick again, and bowing his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) head left the court.
<p/>Observing this, and how, without another word, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) made off, and observing too the resignation of the plaintiff, Sancho buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bosom and remained for a short space in deep thought, with the forefinger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) right hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) brow and nose; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head and bade them call back the old man with the stick, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) departure.
<p/>They brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, and as soon as Sancho saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Honest man, give me that stick, for I want it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sancho took it and, handing it to the other old man, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Go, and God be with you; for now you are paid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Willingly,'' said the old man; <div class="bookquote">``here it is senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man senor</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I, senor! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>returned the old man; <div class="bookquote">``why, is this cane worth ten gold-crowns?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes,'' said the governor, <div class="bookquote">``or if not I am the greatest dolt in the world; now you will see whether I have got the headpiece to govern a whole kingdom;''  (<font color='red'><b>the governor dolt</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) ordered the cane to be broken in two, there, in the presence of all.
<p/>'' It was done, and in the middle of it they found ten gold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and looked upon their governor as another Solomon.
<p/>They asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) had come to the conclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) replied, that observing how the old man who swore gave the stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opponent while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was taking the oath, and swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had really and truly given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the crowns, and how as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done swearing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked for the stick again, it came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head that the sum demanded must be inside it; and from this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said it might be seen that God sometimes guides those who govern in their judgments, even though they may be fools; besides he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had himself heard the curate of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) village mention just such another case, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had so good a memory, that if it was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forgot everything he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wished to remember, there would not be such a memory in all the island.
<p/>To conclude, the old men went off, one crestfallen, and the other in high contentment, all who were present were astonished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who was recording the words, deeds, and movements of Sancho could not make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mind whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was to look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) down as a fool or as a man of sense.
<p/>As soon as this case was disposed of, there came into court a woman holding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well-to-do cattle dealer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Justice, senor governor, justice!
<p/>Senor governor of my soul, this wicked man caught me in the middle of the fields here and used my body as if it was an ill-washed rag, and, woe is me!
<p/>got from me what I had kept these three-and-twenty years and more, defending it against Moors and Christians, natives and strangers; and I always as hard as an oak, and keeping myself as pure as a salamander in the fire, or wool among the brambles, for this good fellow to come now with clean hands to handle me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; and turning to the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to say in answer to the woman's charge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all in confusion made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Sirs, I am a poor pig dealer, and this morning I left the village to sell -LRB-saving your presence-RRB- four pigs, and between dues and cribbings they got out of me little less than the worth of them.
<p/>As I was returning to my village I fell in on the road with this good dame, and the devil who makes a coil and a mess out of everything, yoked us together.
<p/>I paid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fairly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not contented laid hold of me and never let go until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brought me here; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says I forced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lies by the oath I swear or am ready to swear; and this is the whole truth and every particle of it.
<p/>The governor on this asked him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) had any money in silver about him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) had about twenty ducats in a leather purse in his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>The governor bade him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) take it out and hand it to the complainant; he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) obeyed trembling; the woman took it, and making a thousand salaams to all and praying to God for the long life and health of the senor governor who had such regard for distressed orphans and virgins, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurried out of court with the purse grasped in both her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, first looking, however, to see if the money it contained was silver.
<p/>and if I don't get it on earth I'll go look for it in heaven. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gone
<p/>Sancho said to the cattle dealer, whose tears were already starting and whose eyes and heart were following his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) purse, <div class="bookquote">``Good fellow, go after that woman and take the purse from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), by force even, and come back with it here;''  (<font color='red'><b>the cattle dealer</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not say it to one who was a fool or deaf, for the man was off like a flash of lightning, and ran to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bid.
<p/>All the bystanders waited anxiously to see the end of the case, and presently both man and woman came back at even closer grips than before, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) petticoat up and the purse in the lap of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) struggling hard to take it from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but all to no purpose, so stout was the woman's defence, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) all the while crying out, <div class="bookquote">``Justice from God and the world!
<p/>see here, senor governor, the shamelessness and boldness of this villain, who in the middle of the town, in the middle of the street, wanted to take from me the purse your worship bade him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) give me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And did he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) take it?'' asked the governor. <div class="bookquote">``Take it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman; <div class="bookquote">``I'd let my life be taken from me sooner than the purse.
<p/>A pretty child I'd be! It's another sort of cat they must throw in my face, and not that poor scurvy knave.
<p/>Pincers and hammers, mallets and chisels would not get it out of my grip; no, nor lions' claws; the soul from out of my body first!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man; <div class="bookquote">``I own myself beaten and powerless ; I confess I haven't the strength to take it from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>);''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let go his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once, and the governor returned it to the man, and said to the unforced mistress of force, ``Sister, if you had shown as much, or only half as much, spirit and vigour in defending your body as you have shown in defending that purse, the strength of Hercules could not have forced you.
<p/>Be off, and God speed you, and bad luck to you, and don't show your face in all this island, or within six leagues of it on any side, under pain of two hundred lashes; be off at once, I say, you shameless, cheating shrew.
<p/>The woman was cowed and went off disconsolately, hanging her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head; and the governor said to the man, ``Honest man, go home with your money, and God speed you; and for the future, if you don't want to lose it, see that you don't take it into your head to yoke with anybody.
<p/>Upon this the governor said to the woman, <div class="bookquote">``Let me see that purse, my worthy and sturdy friend. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>The man thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as clumsily as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could and went his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, and the bystanders were again filled with admiration at their new governor's judgments and sentences.
<p/>Next, two men, one apparently a farm labourer, and the other a tailor, for he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) had a pair of shears in his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) hand, presented themselves before him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>), and the tailor said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor governor, this labourer and I come before your worship by reason of this honest man coming to my shop yesterday -LRB-for saving everybody's presence
<p/>I'm a passed tailor, God be thanked-RRB-, and putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me, `Senor, will there be enough in this cloth to make me a cap?'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) probably suspected--as I supposed, and I supposed right--that I wanted to steal some of the cloth, led to think so by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own roguery and
<p/>Measuring the cloth I said there would. the bad opinion people have of tailors; and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told me to see if there would be enough for two.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), still following up his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) original unworthy notion, went on adding cap after cap, and I `yes' after `yes,' until we got as far as five.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has just this moment come for them; I gave them to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) won't pay me for the making; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) calls upon me to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), or else return his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cloth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the tailor</b></font>)</div><p/>I guessed what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would be at, and I said `yes.' <div class="bookquote">``Is all this true, brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' Yes,'' replied the man; <div class="bookquote">``but will your worship make him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) show the five caps he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) has made me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tailor</b></font>)</div>said the tailor; and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) hand from under his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) cloak he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) showed five caps stuck upon the five fingers of it, and said, ``there are the caps this good man asks for; and by God and upon my conscience I haven't a scrap of cloth left, and
<p/>All present laughed at the number of caps and the novelty of the suit; Sancho set himself to think for a moment, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that in this case it is not necessary to deliver long-winded arguments, but only to give off-hand the judgment of an honest man; and so my decision is that the tailor lose the making and the labourer the cloth, and that the caps go to the prisoners in the gaol, and let there be no more about it.
<p/>If the previous decision about the cattle dealer's purse excited the admiration of the bystanders, this provoked their laughter; however, the governor's orders were after all executed.
<p/>All this, having been taken down by his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) chronicler, was at once despatched to the duke, who was looking out for it with great eagerness; and here let us leave the good Sancho; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, sorely troubled in mind by Altisidora's music, has pressing claims upon us now.
<p/>I'll let the work be examined by the inspectors of the trade. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER XLVI. OF THE TERRIBLE BELL AND CAT FRIGHT
<p/>We left Don Quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of the enamourned maid Altisidora had given rise to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went to bed with them, and just like fleas they would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sleep or get a moment's rest, and the broken stitches of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stockings helped them.
<p/>But as Time is fleet and no obstacle can stay his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) came riding on the hours, and morning very soon arrived.
<p/>Seeing which Don Quixote quitted the soft down, and, nowise slothful, dressed himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chamois suit and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) travelling boots to hide the disaster to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stockings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) threw over him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) scarlet mantle, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head a montera of green velvet trimmed with silver edging, flung across his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shoulder the baldric with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) good trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) always carried with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) passed through a gallery, Altisidora and the other damsel, her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) friend, were lying in wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and the instant Altisidora saw him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) pretended to faint, while her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) friend caught her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) lap, and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) dress.
<p/>THAT DON QUIXOTE GOT IN THE COURSE OF THE ENAMOURED ALTISIDORA'S WOOING Don Quixote observed it, and approaching them said, <div class="bookquote">``I know very well what this seizure arises from.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not from what,''  (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div>replied the friend, ``for Altisidora is the healthiest damsel in all this house, and I have never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) complain all the time I have known her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>).
<p/>Go away, Senor Don Quixote; for this poor child will not come to herself again so long as you are here.
<p/>To which Don Quixote returned, <div class="bookquote">``Do me the favour, senora, to let a lute be placed in my chamber to-night; and I will comfort this poor maiden to the best of my power; for in the early stages of love a prompt disillusion is an approved remedy;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) retired, so as not to be remarked by any who might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had scarcely withdrawn when Altisidora, recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) swoon, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) companion, <div class="bookquote">``The lute must be left, for no doubt Don Quixote intends to give us some music; and being his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) it will not be bad.
<p/>They went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on, and of the lute Don Quixote asked for, and she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), delighted beyond measure, plotted with the duke and her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) two damsels to play him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a trick that should be amusing but harmless; and in high glee they waited for night, which came quickly as the day had come; and as for the day, the duke and duchess spent it in charming conversation with Don Quixote.
<p/>When eleven o'clock came, Don Quixote found a guitar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chamber; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) tried it, opened the window, and perceived that some persons were walking in the garden; and having passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fingers over the frets of the guitar and tuned it as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spat and cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chest, and then with a voice a little hoarse but full-toned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sang the following ballad, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had himself that day composed: Mighty Love the hearts of maidens
<p/>A plague on all the knights-errant in the world, if they be all ungrateful! ''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>'' Doth unsettle and perplex, And the instrument he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) uses Most of all is idleness.
<p/>Sewing, stitching, any labour, Having always work to do, To the poison Love instilleth Is the antidote most sure. And to proper-minded maidens
<p/>Who desire the matron's name Modesty's a marriage portion, Modesty their highest praise. Men of prudence and discretion, Courtiers gay and gallant knights, With the wanton damsels dally,
<p/>There are passions, transient, fleeting, Loves in hostelries declar'd, Sunrise loves, with sunset ended, When the guest hath gone his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) way.
<p/>But the modest take to wife. Love that springs up swift and sudden, Here to-day, to-morrow flown, Passes, leaves no trace behind it,
<p/>Leaves no image on the soul. Painting that is laid on painting Maketh no display or show; Where one beauty's in possession
<p/>There no other can take hold. Dulcinea del Toboso Painted on my heart I wear; Never from its tablets, never, Can her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) image be eras'd.
<p/>The quality of all in lovers Most esteemed is constancy; 'T is by this that love works wonders, This exalts them to the skies.
<p/>Don Quixote had got so far with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) song, to which the duke, the duchess, Altisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle were listening, when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) window they let down a cord with more than a hundred bells attached to it, and immediately after that discharged a great sack full of cats, which also had bells of smaller size tied to their tails.
<p/>Such was the din of the bells and the squalling of the cats, that though the duke and duchess were the contrivers of the joke they were startled by it, while Don Quixote stood paralysed with fear; and as luck would have it, two or three of the cats made their way in through the grating of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chamber, and flying from one side to the other, made it seem as if there was a legion of devils at large in it.
<p/>They extinguished the candles that were burning in the room, and rushed about seeking some way of escape; the cord with the large bells never ceased rising and falling; and most of the people of the castle, not knowing what was really the matter, were at their wits' end with astonishment.
<p/>Don Quixote sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet, and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword, began making passes at the grating, shouting out, ``Avaunt, malignant enchanters!
<p/>avaunt, ye witchcraft-working rabble! I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, against whom your evil machinations avail not nor have any power.
<p/>They dashed at the grating and escaped by it, save one that, finding itself hard pressed by the slashes of Don Quixote's sword, flew at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face and held on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) nose tooth and nail, with the pain of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began to shout his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) loudest.
<p/>The duke and duchess hearing this, and guessing what it was, ran with all haste to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) room, and as the poor gentleman was striving with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might to detach the cat from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face, they opened the door with a master-key and went in with lights and witnessed the unequal combat.
<p/>The duke ran forward to part the combatants, but Don Quixote cried out aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Let no one take him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) from me; leave me hand to hand with this demon, this wizard, this enchanter; I will teach him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>), I myself, who Don Quixote of La Mancha is.
<p/>The cat, however, never minding these threats, snarled and held on; but at last the duke pulled it off and flung it out of the window.
<p/>Don Quixote was left with a face as full of holes as a sieve and a nose not in very good condition, and greatly vexed that they did not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) finish the battle he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had been so stoutly fighting with that villain of an enchanter.
<p/>They sent for some oil of John's wort, and Altisidora herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own fair hands bandaged all the wounded parts; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did so she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in a low voice.
<p/>All these mishaps have befallen thee, hardhearted knight, for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and God grant thy squire
<p/>Sancho may forget to whip himself, so that that dearly beloved Dulcinea of thine may never be released from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) enchantment, that thou mayest never come to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bed, at least while I who adore thee am alive.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>And turning upon the cats that were running about the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) made several cuts at them. '' '' ''
<p/>To all this Don Quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs, and then stretched himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bed, thanking the duke and duchess for their kindness, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stood in any fear of that bell-ringing rabble of enchanters in cat shape, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) recognised their good intentions in coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rescue.
<p/>The duke and duchess left him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to repose and withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the joke; as they never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on Don Quixote or cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) so dear, for it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) five days of confinement to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bed, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had another adventure, pleasanter than the late one, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chronicler will not relate just now in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) may turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) attention to Sancho Panza, who was proceeding with great diligence and drollery in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) government.
<p/>The history says that from the justice court they carried Sancho to a sumptuous palace, where in a spacious chamber there was a table laid out with royal magnificence.
<p/>The clarions sounded as Sancho entered the room, and four pages came forward to present him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with water for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hands, which Sancho received with great dignity.
<p/>The music ceased, and Sancho seated himself at the head of the table, for there was only that seat placed, and no more than one cover laid.
<p/>A personage, who it appeared afterwards was a physician, placed himself standing by his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) side with a whalebone wand in his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) hand.
<p/>CHAPTER XLVII. WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ACCOUNT OF HOW SANCHO PANZA CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN HIS (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) GOVERNMENT They then lifted up a fine white cloth covering fruit and a great variety of dishes of different sorts;
<p/>one who looked like a student said grace, and a page put a laced bib on Sancho, while another who played the part of head carver placed a dish of fruit before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>But hardly had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tasted a morsel when the man with the wand touched the plate with it, and they took it away from before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with the utmost celerity.
<p/>The carver, however, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) another dish, and Sancho proceeded to try it; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could get at it, not to say taste it, already the wand had touched it and a page had carried it off with the same promptitude as the fruit.
<p/>Sancho seeing this was puzzled, and looking from one to another asked if this dinner was to be eaten after the fashion of a jugglery trick.
<p/>To this he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with the wand replied, <div class="bookquote">``It is not to be eaten, senor governor, except as is usual and customary in other islands where there are governors.
<p/>I, senor, am a physician, and I am paid a salary in this island to serve its governors as such, and I have a much greater regard for their health than for my own, studying day and night and making myself acquainted with the governor's constitution, in order to be able to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) falls sick.
<p/>The chief thing I have to do is to attend at his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) dinners and suppers and allow him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) to eat what appears to me to be fit for him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), and keep from him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) what I think will do him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) harm and be injurious to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) stomach; and therefore I ordered that plate of fruit to be removed as being too moist, and that other dish I ordered to be removed as being too hot and containing many spices that stimulate thirst; for he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) who drinks much kills and consumes the radical moisture wherein life consists.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well then,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that dish of roast partridges there that seems so savoury will not do me any harm.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>To this the physician replied, <div class="bookquote">``Of those my lord the governor shall not eat so long as I live.''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho.
<p/>Because,'' replied the doctor, <div class="bookquote">``our master Hippocrates, the polestar and beacon of medicine, says in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) aphorisms omnis saturatio mala, perdicis autem pessima, which means `all repletion is bad, but that of partridge is the worst of all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>In that case,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``let senor doctor see among the dishes that are on the table what will do me most good and least harm, and let me eat it, without tapping it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stick; for by the life of the governor, and so may God suffer me to enjoy it, but I'm dying of hunger; and in spite of the doctor and all he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) may say, to deny me food is the way to take my life instead of prolonging it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your worship is right, senor governor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>said the physician; <div class="bookquote">``and therefore your worship, I consider, should not eat of those stewed rabbits there, because it is a furry kind of food; if that veal were not roasted and served with pickles, you might try it; but it is out of the question.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That big dish that is smoking farther off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``seems to me to be an olla podrida, and out of the diversity of things in such ollas, I can't fail to light upon something tasty and good for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>There is nothing in the world less nourishing than an olla podrida; to canons, or rectors of colleges, or peasants' weddings with your ollas podridas, but let us have none of them on the tables of governors, where everything that is present should be delicate and refined; and the reason is, that always, everywhere and by everybody, simple medicines are more esteemed than compound ones, for we cannot go wrong in those that are simple, while in the compound we may, by merely altering the quantity of the things composing them.
<p/>But what I am of opinion the governor should eat now in order to preserve and fortify his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes and a few thin slices of conserve of quinces, which will settle his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) stomach and help his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) digestion.
<p/>Sancho on hearing this threw himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) chair and surveyed the doctor steadily, and in a solemn tone asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) what his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) name was and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had studied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) replied, ``My name, senor governor, is Doctor Pedro Recio de Aguero I am a native of a place called Tirteafuera which lies between Caracuel and Almodovar del Campo, on the right-hand side, and I have the degree of doctor from the university of Osuna.
<p/>To which Sancho, glowing all over with rage, returned, <div class="bookquote">``Then let Doctor Pedro Recio de Malaguero, native of Tirteafuera, a place that's on the right-hand side as we go from Caracuel to Almodovar del Campo, graduate of Osuna, get out of my presence at once; or I swear by the sun I'll take a cudgel, and by dint of blows, beginning with him (<font color='blue'><b>Osuna</b></font>), I'll not leave a doctor in the whole island; at least of those I know to be ignorant; for as to learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I will reverence and honour as divine persons.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Absit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor; <div class="bookquote">``far from us be any such base thought!

<p/>And if they call me to account for it, I'll clear myself by saying I served God in killing a bad doctor--a general executioner.
<p/>And now give me something to eat, or else take your government; for a trade that does not feed its master is not worth two beans.
<p/>The doctor was dismayed when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) saw the governor in such a passion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would have made a Tirteafuera out of the room but that the same instant a post-horn sounded in the street; and the carver putting his (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) head out of the window turned round and said, <div class="bookquote">``It's a courier from my lord the duke, no doubt with some despatch of importance.
<p/>The courier came in all sweating and flurried, and taking a paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) bosom, placed it in the governor's hands.
<p/>Sancho handed it to the majordomo and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) read the superscription, which ran thus: To Don Sancho Panza, Governor of the Island of Barataria, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) own hands or those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) secretary.
<p/>I'll take this chair I am sitting on and break it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) head. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the carver</b></font>)</div>'' Sancho when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heard this said, <div class="bookquote">``Which of you is my secretary?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With that addition,'' said Sancho, ``you might be secretary to the emperor himself; open this paper and see what it says.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one of those present, <div class="bookquote">``for I can read and write, and am a Biscayan.''

<p/>Sancho ordered the chamber to be cleared, the majordomo and the carver only remaining; so the doctor and the others withdrew, and then the secretary read the letter, which was as follows: It has come to my knowledge, Senor Don Sancho Panza, that certain enemies of mine and of the island are about to make a furious attack upon it some night, I know not when.
<p/>I also know by trustworthy spies that four persons have entered the town in disguise in order to take your life, because they stand in dread of your great capacity; keep your eyes open and take heed who approaches you to address you, and eat nothing that is presented to you.
<p/>I will take care to send you aid if you find yourself in difficulty, but in all things you will act as may be expected of your judgment.
<p/>It behoves you to be on the alert and keep watch, that they surprise you not. From this place, the Sixteenth of August, at four in the morning.
<p/>Your friend, THE DUKE Sancho was astonished, and those who stood by made believe to be so too, and turning to the majordomo he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``What we have got to do first, and it must be done at once, is to put Doctor Recio in the lock-up; for if anyone wants to kill me it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and by a slow death and the worst of all, which is hunger.''

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>we must be well provisioned; for it is the tripes that carry the heart and not the heart the tripes.
<p/>And you, secretary, answer my lord the duke and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) that all his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) commands shall be obeyed to the letter, as he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) directs; and say from me to my lady the duchess that I kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) hands, and that I beg of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) not to forget to send my letter and bundle to my wife Teresa Panza by a messenger; and I will take it as a great favour and will not fail to serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) in all that may lie within my power; and as you are about it you may enclose a kiss of the hand to my master Don Quixote that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) may see I am grateful bread; and as a good secretary and a good Biscayan you may add whatever you like and whatever will come in best; and now take away this cloth and give me something to eat, and I'll be ready to meet all the spies and assassins and enchanters that may come against me or my island.
<p/>At this instant a page entered saying, <div class="bookquote">``Here is a farmer on business, who wants to speak to your lordship on a matter of great importance, he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) says.

<p/>The farmer obeyed, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``I am a farmer, senor, a native of Miguelturra, a village two leagues from Ciudad Real.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The case is this, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miguelturra</b></font>)</div>continued the farmer, <div class="bookquote">``that by God's mercy I am married with the leave and licence of the holy Roman Catholic Church; I have two sons, students, and the younger is studying to become bachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am a widower, for my wife died, or more properly speaking, a bad doctor killed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) on my hands, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a purge when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was with child; and if it had pleased God that the child had been born, and was a boy, I would have put him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to study for doctor, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might not envy his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brothers the bachelor and the licentiate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>So that if your wife had not died, or had not been killed, you would not now be a widower,'' said Sancho.

<p/>Well then,'' said the farmer, <div class="bookquote">``this son of mine who is going to be a bachelor, fell in love in the said town with a damsel called Clara Perlerina, daughter of Andres Perlerino, a very rich farmer; and this name of Perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent, but because all the family are paralytics, and for a better name they call them Perlerines; though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as an Oriental pearl, and like a flower of the field, if you look at her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) on the right side; on the left not so much, for on that side she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) wants an eye that she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) lost by small-pox; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) face is thickly and deeply pitted, those who love her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) say they are not pits that are there, but the graves where the hearts of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) lovers are buried.

<p/>Of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) lips I say nothing, for they are so fine and thin that, if lips might be reeled, one might make a skein of them; but being of a different colour from ordinary lips they are wonderful, for they are mottled, blue, green, and purple--let my lord the governor pardon me for painting so minutely the charms of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) who some time or other will be my daughter; for I love her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), and I don't find her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) amiss.

<p/>Exceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded Don Quixote, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face bandaged and marked, not by the hand of God, but by the claws of a cat, mishaps incidental to knight-errantry.
<p/>Six days he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) remained without appearing in public, and one night as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lay awake thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) misfortunes and of Altisidora's pursuit of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) perceived that some one was opening the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) room with a key, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at once made up his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind that the enamoured damsel was coming to make an assault upon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) chastity and put him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in danger of failing in the fidelity he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) owed to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lady Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>No,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), firmly persuaded of the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) idea -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said it loud enough to be heard-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``the greatest beauty upon earth shall not avail to make me renounce my adoration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) whom I bear stamped and graved in the core of my heart and the secret depths of my bowels; be thou, lady mine, transformed into a clumsy country wench, or into a nymph of golden Tagus weaving a web of silk and gold, let Merlin or Montesinos hold thee captive where they will; where'er thou art, thou art mine, and

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) stood up on the bed wrapped from head to foot in a yellow satin coverlet, with a cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) moustaches tied up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) face because of the scratches, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) moustaches to keep them from drooping and falling down, in which trim he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) looked the most extraordinary scarecrow that could be conceived.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) eyes fixed on the door, and just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) was expecting to see the love-smitten and unhappy Altisidora make her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) appearance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) saw coming in a most venerable duenna, in a long white-bordered veil that covered and enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) from head to foot.
<p/>Between the fingers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) left hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) held a short lighted candle, while with her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) right she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) shaded it to keep the light from her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) eyes, which were covered by spectacles of great size, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) advanced with noiseless steps, treading very softly.
<p/>Don Quixote kept an eye upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) watchtower, and observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) costume and noting her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) concluded that it must be some witch or sorceress that was coming in such a guise to work him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) some mischief, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began crossing himself at a great rate.
<p/>The spectre still advanced, and on reaching the middle of the room, looked up and saw the energy with which Don Quixote was crossing himself; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was scared by seeing such a figure as hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) was terrified at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); for the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) tall yellow form with the coverlet and the bandages that disfigured him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) gave a loud scream, and exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Jesus!
<p/>what's this I see?''  (<font color='red'><b>a scream</b></font>)</div>let fall the candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) fright, and then finding herself in the dark, turned about to make off, but stumbling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) skirts in her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) consternation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) measured her (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) length with a mighty fall.

<p/>if so be you are indeed Don Quixote ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Senora Dona Rodriguez,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``do you perchance come to transact any go-between business?
<p/>Because I must tell you I am not available for anybody's purpose, thanks to the peerless beauty of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>In short, Senora Dona Rodriguez, if you will leave out and put aside all love messages, you may go and light your candle and come back, and we will discuss all the commands you have for me and whatever you wish, saving only, as I said, all seductive communications.''

<p/>God be praised I have a soul in my body still, and all my teeth and grinders in my mouth, except one or two that the colds, so common in this Aragon country, have robbed me of.
<p/>But wait a little, while I go and light my candle, and I will return immediately and lay my sorrows before you as before one who relieves those of all the world;''  (<font color='red'><b>the duenna</b></font>)</div>and without staying for an answer she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) quitted the room and left Don Quixote tranquilly meditating while he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>A thousand thoughts at once suggested themselves to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) on the subject of this new adventure, and it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as being ill done and worse advised in him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to expose himself to the danger of breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) plighted faith to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lady; and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to himself, ``Who knows but that the devil, being wily and cunning, may be trying now to entrap me with a duenna, having failed with empresses, queens, duchesses, marchionesses, and countesses?
<p/>Many a time have I heard it said by many a man of sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will sooner offer you a flat-nosed wench than a roman-nosed one; and who knows but this privacy, this opportunity, this silence, may awaken my sleeping desires, and lead me in these my latter years to fall where I have never tripped?
<p/>But I must be out of my senses to think and utter such nonsense; for it is impossible that a long, white-hooded spectacled duenna could stir up or excite a wanton thought in the most graceless bosom in the world.
<p/>In cases of this sort it is better to flee than to await the battle. Is there a duenna on earth that has fair flesh?
<p/>Is there a duenna in the world that escapes being ill-tempered, wrinkled, and prudish? Avaunt, then, ye duenna crew, undelightful to all mankind.
<p/>Oh, but that lady did well who, they say, had at the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reception room a couple of figures of duennas with spectacles and lace-cushions, as if at work, and those statues served quite as well to give an air of propriety to the room as if they had been real duennas.
<p/>So saying he (<font color='blue'><b>duenna</b></font>) leaped off the bed, intending to close the door and not allow Senora Rodriguez to enter; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) went to shut it
<p/>Senora Rodriguez returned with a wax candle lighted, and having a closer view of Don Quixote, with the coverlet round him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bandages and night-cap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) was alarmed afresh, and retreating a couple of paces, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Am I safe, sir knight?
<p/>I don't look upon it as a sign of very great virtue that your worship should have got up out of bed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a couple</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may well ask the same, senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``and I do ask whether I shall be safe from being assailed and forced?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Of you and against you I ask it,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``for I am not marble, nor are you brass, nor is it now ten o'clock in the morning, but midnight, or a trifle past it I fancy, and we are in a room more secluded and retired than the cave could have been where the treacherous and daring AEneas enjoyed the fair soft-hearted Dido.
<p/>But give me your hand, senora; I require no better protection than my own continence, and my own sense of propriety; as well as that which is inspired by that venerable head-dress;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dido</b></font>) right hand and took it in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dido</b></font>) yielding it to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) with equal ceremoniousness.
<p/>And here Cide Hamete inserts a parenthesis in which he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) says that to have seen the pair marching from the door to the bed, linked hand in hand in this way
<p/>'' for <div class="bookquote">``Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the duenna. '' , he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) would have given the best of the two tunics he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had.
<p/>Don Quixote finally got into bed, and Dona Rodriguez took her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) seat on a chair at some little distance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) couch, without taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) spectacles or putting aside the candle.
<p/>Don Quixote wrapped the bedclothes round him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and covered himself up completely, leaving nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face visible, and as soon as they had both regained their composure he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) broke silence, saying, ``Now, Senora Dona Rodriguez, you may unbosom yourself and out with everything you have in your sorrowful heart and afflicted bowels; and by me you shall be listened to with chaste ears, and aided by compassionate exertions.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duenna</b></font>)</div>replied the duenna; <div class="bookquote">``from your worship's gentle and winning presence only such a Christian answer could be expected.
<p/>The fact is, then, Senor Don Quixote, that though you see me seated in this chair, here in the middle of the kingdom of Aragon, and in the attire of a despised outcast duenna, I am from the Asturias of Oviedo, and of a family with which many of the best of the province are connected by blood; but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents, who, I know not how, were unseasonably reduced to poverty, brought me to the court of Madrid, where as a provision and to avoid greater misfortunes, my parents placed me as seamstress in the service of a lady of quality, and I would have you know that for hemming and sewing I have never been surpassed by any all my life.
<p/>My parents left me in service and returned to their own country, and a few years later went, no doubt, to heaven, for they were excellent good Catholic Christians.
<p/>I was left an orphan with nothing but the miserable wages and trifling presents that are given to servants of my sort in palaces; but about this time, without any encouragement on my part, one of the esquires of the household fell in love with me, a man somewhat advanced in years, full-bearded and personable, and above all as good a gentleman as the king himself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came of a mountain stock.
<p/>We did not carry on our loves with such secrecy but that they came to the knowledge of my lady, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), not to have any fuss about it, had us married with the full sanction of the holy mother Roman Catholic Church, of which marriage a daughter was born to put an end to my good fortune, if I had any; not that I died in childbirth, for I passed through it safely and in due season, but because shortly afterwards my husband died of a certain shock he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) received, and had I time to tell you of it
<p/>I know your worship would be surprised;''  (<font color='red'><b>the duenna</b></font>)</div>and here she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) began to weep bitterly and said, <div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, Senor Don Quixote, if I am unable to control myself, for every time I think of my unfortunate husband my eyes fill up with tears.
<p/>God bless me, with what an air of dignity he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) used to carry my lady behind him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) on a stout mule as black as jet!
<p/>for in those days they did not use coaches or chairs, as they say they do now, and ladies rode behind their squires.
<p/>This much at least I cannot help telling you, that you may observe the good breeding and punctiliousness of my worthy husband.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was turning into the Calle de Santiago in Madrid, which is rather narrow, one of the alcaldes of the Court, with two alguacils before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), was coming out of it, and as soon as my good squire saw him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) mule about and made as if he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would turn and accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>).
<p/>My lady, who was riding behind him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), said to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) in a low voice, `What are you about, you sneak, don't you see that I am here?'
<p/>The alcalde like a polite man pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `Proceed, senor, for it is I, rather, who ought to accompany my lady Dona Casilda'--for that was my mistress's name.
<p/>Still my husband, cap in hand, persisted in trying to accompany the alcalde, and seeing this my lady, filled with rage and vexation, pulled out a big pin, or, I rather think, a bodkin, out of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) needle-case and drove it into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back with such force that my husband gave a loud yell, and writhing fell to the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lady.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) two lacqueys ran to rise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up, and the alcalde and the alguacils did the same; the Guadalajara gate was all in commotion--
<p/>I mean the idlers congregated there; my mistress came back on foot, and my husband hurried away to a barber's shop protesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was run right through the guts.
<p/>The courtesy of my husband was noised abroad to such an extent, that the boys gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no peace in the street; and on this account, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was somewhat shortsighted, my lady dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and it was chagrin at this I am convinced beyond a doubt that brought on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) death.
<p/>I was left a helpless widow, with a daughter on my hands growing up in beauty like the sea-foam; at length, however, as I had the character of being an excellent needlewoman, my lady the duchess, then lately married to my lord the duke, offered to take me with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to this kingdom of Aragon, and my daughter also, and here as time went by my daughter grew up and with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) all the graces in the world; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sings like a lark, dances quick as thought, foots it like a gipsy, reads and writes like a schoolmaster, and does sums like a miser; of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) neatness I say nothing, for the running water is not purer, and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) age is now, if my memory serves me, sixteen years five months and three days, one more or less.
<p/>To come to the point, the son of a very rich farmer, living in a village of my lord the duke's not very far from here, fell in love with this girl of mine; and in short, how I know not, they came together, and under the promise of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) made a fool of my daughter, and will not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) word.
<p/>And though my lord the duke is aware of it -LRB-for I have complained to him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), not once but many and many a time, and entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to order the farmer to marry my daughter-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) turns a deaf ear and will scarcely listen to me; the reason being that as the deceiver's father is so rich, and lends him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) money, and is constantly going security for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) debts, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does not like to offend or annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in any way.
<p/>Now, senor, I want your worship to take it upon yourself to redress this wrong either by entreaty or by arms; for by what all the world says you came into it to redress grievances and right wrongs and help the unfortunate.
<p/>Let your worship put before you the unprotected condition of my daughter, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) youth, and all the perfections I have said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) possesses; and before God and on my conscience, out of all the damsels my lady has, there is not one that comes up to the sole of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoe, and the one they call Altisidora, and look upon as the boldest and gayest of them, put in comparison with my daughter, does not come within two leagues of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>For I would have you know, senor, all is not gold that glitters, and that same little Altisidora has more forwardness than good looks, and more impudence than modesty; besides being not very sound, for she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has such a disagreeable breath that one cannot bear to be near her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) for a moment; and even my lady the duchess--but I'll hold my tongue, for they say that walls have ears.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``For heaven's sake, Dona Rodriguez, what ails my lady the duchess?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>asked Don Quixote. '' Adjured in that way,'' replied the duenna, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot help answering the question and telling the whole truth.
<p/>Senor Don Quixote, have you observed the comeliness of my lady the duchess, that smooth complexion of hers like a burnished polished sword, those two cheeks of milk and carmine, that gay lively step with which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) treads or rather seems to spurn the earth, so that one would fancy
<p/>Well then, let me tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may thank, first of all God, for this, and next, two issues that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has, one in each leg, by which all the evil humours, of which the doctors say she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is full, are discharged.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went radiating health wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed?

''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``and is it possible that my lady the duchess has drains of that sort?
<p/>I would not have believed it if the barefoot friars had told it me; but as the lady Dona Rodriguez says so, it must be so.
<p/>But surely such issues, and in such places, do not discharge humours, but liquid amber. Verily, I do believe now that this practice of opening issues is a very important matter for the health.
<p/>Don Quixote had hardly said this, when the chamber door flew open with a loud bang, and with the start the noise gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) Dona Rodriguez let the candle fall from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) hand, and the room was left as dark as a wolf's mouth, as the saying is.
<p/>Suddenly the poor duenna felt two hands seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) by the throat, so tightly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) could not croak, while some one else, without uttering a word, very briskly hoisted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) petticoats, and with what seemed to be a slipper began to lay on so heartily that anyone would have felt pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>); but although Don Quixote felt it he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) never stirred from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bed, but lay quiet and silent, nay apprehensive that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) turn for a drubbing might be coming.
<p/>well basted, the silent executioners fell upon Don Quixote, and stripping him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the sheet and the coverlet, they pinched him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) so fast and so hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was driven to defend himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fists, and all this in marvellous silence.
<p/>The battle lasted nearly half an hour, and then the phantoms fled; Dona Rodriguez gathered up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) skirts, and bemoaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) fate went out without saying a word to Don Quixote, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), sorely pinched, puzzled, and dejected, remained alone, and there we will leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), wondering who could have been the perverse enchanter who had reduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to such a state; but that shall be told in due season, for Sancho claims our attention, and the methodical arrangement of the story demands it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>Nor was the apprehension an idle one; for leaving the duenna -LRB-who did not dare to cry out-RRB- CHAPTER XLIX.
<p/>We left the great governor angered and irritated by that portrait-painting rogue of a farmer who, instructed the majordomo, as the majordomo was by the duke, tried to practise upon him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) however, fool, boor, and clown as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was, held his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) own against them all, saying to those round him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) and to Doctor Pedro Recio, who as soon as the private business of the duke's letter was disposed of had returned to the room,
<p/>``Now I see plainly enough that judges and governors ought to be and must be made of brass not to feel the importunities of the applicants that at all times and all seasons insist on being heard, and having their business despatched, and their own affairs and no others attended to, come what may; and if the poor judge does not hear them and settle the matter--either because he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) cannot or
<p/>because that is not the time set apart for hearing them-forthwith they abuse him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), and run him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) down, and gnaw at his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) bones, and even pick holes in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) pedigree.
<p/>You silly, stupid applicant, don't be in a hurry; wait for the proper time and season for doing business; don't come at dinner-hour, or at bed-time; for judges are only flesh and blood, and must give to Nature what she (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) naturally demands of them; all except myself, for in my case I give her (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) nothing to eat, thanks to Senor Doctor Pedro Recio Tirteafuera here, who would have me die of hunger, and declares that death to be life; and the same sort of life may God give him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kind--I mean the bad doctors; for the good ones deserve palms and laurels.
<p/>All who knew Sancho Panza were astonished to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) speak so elegantly, and did not know what to attribute it to unless it were that office and grave responsibility either smarten or stupefy men's wits.
<p/>At last Doctor Pedro Recio Agilers of Tirteafuera promised to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) have supper that night though it might be in contravention of all the aphorisms of Hippocrates.
<p/>With this the governor was satisfied and looked forward to the approach of night and supper-time with great anxiety; and though time, to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) mind, stood still and made no progress, nevertheless the hour he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) so longed for came, and they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) a beef salad with onions and some boiled calves' feet rather far gone.
<p/>At this he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) fell to with greater relish than if they had given him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) francolins from Milan, pheasants from Rome, veal from Sorrento, partridges from Moron, or geese from Lavajos, and turning to the doctor at supper
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Look here, senor doctor, for the future don't trouble yourself about giving me dainty things or choice dishes to eat, for it will be only taking my stomach off its hinges; it is accustomed to goat, cow, bacon, hung beef, turnips and onions; and if by any chance it is given these palace dishes, it receives them squeamishly, and sometimes with loathing.
<p/>What the head-carver had best do is to serve me with what they call ollas podridas -LRB-and the rottener they are the better they smell-RRB-; and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) can put whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) likes into them, so long as it is good to eat, and I'll be obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and will requite him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) some day.
<p/>But let nobody play pranks on me, for either we are or we are not; let us live and eat in peace and good-fellowship, for when God sends the dawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sends it for all.
<p/>I mean to govern this island without giving up a right or taking a bribe; let everyone keep his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eye open, and look out for the arrow; for I can tell them `the devil's in Cantillana,' and if they drive me to it they'll see something that will astonish them.

 (<font color='red'><b>the carver</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and they would be great fools if they did or thought otherwise; once more I say, see to my feeding and my Dapple's for that is the great point and what is most to the purpose; and when the hour comes let us go the rounds, for it is my intention to purge this island of all manner of uncleanness and of all idle good-for-nothing vagabonds
<p/>; for I would have you know that lazy idlers are the same thing in a State as the drones in a hive, that eat up the honey the industrious bees make.
<p/>I mean to protect the husbandman, to preserve to the gentleman his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) privileges, to reward the virtuous, and above all to respect religion and honour its ministers.
<p/>What say you to that, my friends? Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>There is so much in what your worship says, senor governor,'' said the majordomo, ``that I am filled with wonder when I see a man like your worship, entirely without learning -LRB-for I believe you have none at all-RRB-, say such things, and so full of sound maxims and sage remarks, very different from what was expected of your worship's intelligence by those who sent us or by us who came here.
<p/>Every day we see something new in this world; jokes become realities, and the jokers find the tables turned upon them.
<p/>They then got ready to go the rounds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started with the majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, the chronicler charged with recording his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) deeds, and alguacils and notaries enough to form a fair-sized squadron.
<p/>In the midst marched Sancho with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) staff, as fine a sight as one could wish to see, and but a few streets of the town had been traversed when they heard a noise as of a clashing of swords.
<p/>They hastened to the spot, and found that the combatants were but two, who seeing the authorities approaching stood still, and one of them exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Help, in the name of God and the king!
<p/>Are men to be allowed to rob in the middle of this town, and rush out and attack people in the very streets?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the authorities</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be calm, my good man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and tell me what the cause of this quarrel is; for I am the governor.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' Night came, and with the permission of Doctor Pedro Recio, the governor had supper. '' Said the other combatant, <div class="bookquote">``Senor governor, I will tell you in a very few words.
<p/>Your worship must know that this gentleman has just now won more than a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite, and God knows how.
<p/>I was there, and gave more than one doubtful point in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) favour, very much against what my conscience told me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made off with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) winnings, and when I made sure he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was going to give me a crown or so at least by way of a present, as it is usual and customary to give men of quality of my sort who stand by to see fair or foul play, and back up swindles, and prevent quarrels, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pocketed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) money and left the house.
<p/>Indignant at this I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and speaking him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fairly and civilly asked him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to give me if it were only eight reals, for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows I am an honest man and that I have neither profession nor property, for my parents never brought me up to any or left me any; but the rogue, who is a greater thief than Cacus and a greater sharper than Andradilla, would not give me more than four reals; so your worship may see how little shame and conscience he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) has.
<p/>But by my faith if you had not come up I'd have made him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) disgorge his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) winnings, and he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>)'d have learned what the range of the steel-yard was.
<p/>The other replied that all his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) antagonist said was true, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) did not choose to give him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) more than four reals because he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) very often gave him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) money; and that those who expected presents ought to be civil and take what is given them with a cheerful countenance, and not make any claim against winners unless they know them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings to be unfairly won; and that there could be no better proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) himself was an honest man than his (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) having refused to give anything; for sharpers always pay tribute to lookers-on who know them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the combatant governor</b></font>)</div>'' What say you to this?'' asked Sancho. '' That is true,'' said the majordomo; <div class="bookquote">``let your worship consider what is to be done with these men.
<p/>What is to be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``is this; you, the winner, be you good, bad, or indifferent, give this assailant of yours a hundred reals at once, and you must disburse thirty more for the poor prisoners; and you who have neither profession nor property, and hang about the island in idleness, take these hundred reals now, and some time of the day to-morrow quit the island under sentence of banishment for ten years, and under pain of completing it in another life if you violate the sentence, for I'll hang you on a gibbet, or at least the hangman will by my orders; not a word from either of you, or I'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) feel my hand.
<p/>The one paid down the money and the other took it, and the latter quitted the island, while the other went home; and then the governor said, <div class="bookquote">``Either I am not good for much, or I'll get rid of these gambling houses, for it strikes me
<p/>This one at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>the governor</b></font>)</div>said one of the notaries, <div class="bookquote">``your worship will not be able to get rid of, for a great man owns it, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loses every year is beyond all comparison more than what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) makes by the cards.
<p/>On the minor gambling houses your worship may exercise your power, and it is they that do most harm and shelter the most barefaced practices; for in the houses of lords and gentlemen of quality the notorious sharpers dare not attempt to play their tricks; and as the vice of gambling has become common, it is better that men should play in houses of repute than in some tradesman's, where they catch an unlucky fellow in the small hours of the morning and skin him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the notaries</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' they are very mischievous.'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I know already, notary, that there is a good deal to be said on that point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho.
<p/>And now a tipstaff came up with a young man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) grasp, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor governor, this youth was coming towards us, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw the officers of justice he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) turned about and ran like a deer, a sure proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) must be some evil-doer; I ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and had it not been that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stumbled and fell, I should never have caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>'' What did you run for, fellow?'' said Sancho. To which the young man replied, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, it was to avoid answering all the questions officers of justice put.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What are you by trade?'' '' A weaver.'' '' And what do you weave?'' <div class="bookquote">``Lance heads, with your worship's good leave.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' You're facetious with me! You plume yourself on being a wag? Very good; and where were you going just now?''
<p/>'' To take the air, senor. '' '' And where does one take the air in this island?'' ``Where it blows.
<p/>your answers are very much to the point; you are a smart youth; but take notice that I am the air, and that I blow upon you a-stern, and send you to gaol.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By God,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, <div class="bookquote">``your worship will make me sleep in gaol just as soon as make me king.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shan't I make thee sleep in gaol?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' Have I not the power to arrest thee and release thee whenever I like?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How? not able!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``take him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) away at once where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>)'ll see his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mistake with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own eyes, even if the gaoler is willing to exert his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) interested generosity on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) behalf; for I'll lay a penalty of two thousand ducats on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) allows him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to stir a step from the prison.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the power your worship has,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, <div class="bookquote">``won't be able to make me sleep in gaol.

<p/>That's ridiculous,'' said the young man; ``the fact is, all the men on earth will not make me sleep in prison.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, you devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``have you got any angel that will deliver you, and take off the irons I am going to order them to put upon you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Now, senor governor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man in a sprightly manner, <div class="bookquote">``let us be reasonable and come to the point.
<p/>Granted your worship may order me to be taken to prison, and to have irons and chains put on me, and to be shut up in a cell, and may lay heavy penalties on the gaoler if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lets me out, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) obeys your orders; still, if I don't choose to sleep, and choose to remain awake all night without closing an eye, will your worship with all your power be able to make me sleep if I don't choose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>So then,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``it would be entirely of your own choice you would keep from sleeping; not in opposition to my will?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, truly,'' said the secretary, <div class="bookquote">``and the fellow has made his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) point.''  (<font color='red'><b>the secretary</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``No, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>said the youth, ``certainly not.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, go, and God be with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``be off home to sleep, and God give you sound sleep, for I don't want to rob you of it; but for the future, let me advise you don't joke with the authorities, because you may come across some one who will bring down the joke on your own skull.
<p/>The young man went his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, and the governor continued his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) round, and shortly afterwards two tipstaffs came up with a man in custody, and said, ``Senor governor, this person, who seems to be a man, is not so, but a woman, and not an ill-favoured one, in man's clothes.
<p/>They raised two or three lanterns to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, and by their light they distinguished the features of a woman to all appearance of the age of sixteen or a little more, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair gathered into a gold and green silk net, and fair as a thousand pearls.
<p/>They scanned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from head to foot, and observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had on red silk stockings with garters of white taffety bordered with gold and pearl; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breeches were of green and gold stuff, and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore a doublet of the finest white and gold cloth; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoes were white and such as men wear; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carried no sword at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belt, but only a richly ornamented dagger, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had several handsome rings.
<p/>In short, the girl seemed fair to look at in the eyes of all, and none of those who beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), the people of the town said they could not imagine who she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, and those who were in on the secret of the jokes that were to be practised upon Sancho were the ones who were most surprised, for this incident or discovery had not been arranged by them; and they watched anxiously to see how the affair would end.
<p/>Sancho was fascinated by the girl's beauty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) who she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was going, and what had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to dress herself in that garb.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes fixed on the ground answered in modest confusion, ``I cannot tell you, senor, before so many people what it is of such consequence to me to have kept secret; one thing I wish to be known, that I am no thief or evildoer, but only an unhappy maiden whom the power of jealousy has led to break through the respect that is due to modesty.
<p/>Hearing this the majordomo said to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Make the people stand back, senor governor, that this lady may say what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wishes with less embarrassment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' Sancho gave the order, and all except the majordomo, the head-carver, and the secretary fell back.
<p/>Finding herself then in the presence of no more, the damsel went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``I am the daughter, sirs, of Pedro Perez Mazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit of coming very often to my father's house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div><p/>That won't do, senora,'' said the majordomo; <div class="bookquote">``for I know Pedro Perez very well, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) has no child at all, either son or daughter; and
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>besides, though you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) is your father, you add then that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) comes very often to your father's house.''
<p/>I am confused just now, sirs,'' said the damsel, <div class="bookquote">``and I don't know what I am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter of Diego de la Llana, whom you must all know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, that will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the majordomo; ``for I know Diego de la Llana, and know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) is a gentleman of position and a rich man, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) has a son and a daughter, and that since he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) was left a widower nobody in all this town can speak of having seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) daughter's face; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) so closely shut up that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) does not give even the sun a chance of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had already noticed that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' for all that report says she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is extremely beautiful. '' <div class="bookquote">``It is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>said the damsel, <div class="bookquote">``and I am that daughter;
<p/>whether report lies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided by this time, as you have seen me;''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>and with this she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) began to weep bitterly.
<p/>On seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver's ear, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Something serious has no doubt happened this poor maiden, that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) goes wandering from home in such a dress and at such an hour, and one of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rank too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Sancho gave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the best comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could, and entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to tell them without any fear what had happened her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), as they would all earnestly and by every means in their power endeavour to relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no doubt about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the carver</b></font>)</div>returned the carver, <div class="bookquote">``and moreover her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tears confirm your suspicion. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the carver</b></font>)</div>'' The fact is, sirs,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that my father has kept me shut up these ten years, for so long
<p/>Mass is said at home in a sumptuous chapel, and all this time I have seen but the sun in the heaven by day, and the moon and the stars by night; nor do I know what streets are like, or plazas, or churches, or even men, except my father and a brother I have, and Pedro Perez the wool-farmer; whom, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Perez</b></font>) came frequently to our house, I took it into my head to call my father, to avoid naming my own.
<p/>This seclusion and the restrictions laid upon my going out, were it only to church, have been keeping me unhappy for many a day and month past; I longed to see the world, or at least the town where I was born, and it did not seem to me that this wish was inconsistent with the respect maidens of good quality should have for themselves.
<p/>When I heard them talking of bull-fights taking place, and of javelin games, and of acting plays, I asked my brother, who is a year younger than myself, to tell me what sort of things these were, and many more that I had never seen; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) explained them to me as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could, but the only effect was to kindle in me a still stronger desire to see them.
<p/>At last, to cut short the story of my ruin, I begged and entreated my brother--O that I had never made such an entreaty-
<p/>is it since the earth received my mother. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And once more she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave way to a burst of weeping. ''
<p/>Proceed, senora,'' said the majordomo, ``and finish your story of what has happened to you, for your words and tears are keeping us all in suspense.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>said the damsel; ``for ill-placed desires can only be paid for in some such way.
<p/>The maiden's beauty had made a deep impression on the head-carver's heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) again raised his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) lantern for another look at her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), and thought they were not tears she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) was shedding, but seed-pearl or dew of the meadow, nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) exalted them still higher, and made Oriental pearls of them, and fervently hoped her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) misfortune might not be so great a one as her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) tears and sobs seemed to indicate.
<p/>The governor was losing patience at the length of time the girl was taking to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) story, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not to keep them waiting any longer; for it was late, and there still remained a good deal of the town to be gone over.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), with broken sobs and half-suppressed sighs, went on to say, <div class="bookquote">``My misfortune, my misadventure, is simply this, that I entreated my brother to dress me up as a man in a suit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes, and take me some night, when our father was asleep, to see the whole town; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), overcome by my entreaties, consented, and dressing me in this suit and himself in clothes of mine that fitted him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as if made for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has not a hair on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chin, and might pass for a very beautiful young girl-RRB-, to-night, about an hour ago, more or less, we left the house, and guided by our youthful and foolish impulse we made the circuit of the whole town, and then, as we were about to return home, we saw a great troop of people coming, and my brother said to me, `Sister, this must be the round, stir your feet and put wings to them, and follow me as fast as you can, lest they recognise us, for that would be a bad business for us;' and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turned about and began, I cannot say to run but to fly; in less than six paces I fell from fright, and then the officer of justice came up and carried me before your worships, where I find myself put to shame before all these people as whimsical and vicious.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>So then, senora,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``no other mishap has befallen you, nor was it jealousy that made you leave home, as you said at the beginning of your story?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing has happened me,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), ``nor was it jealousy that brought me out, but merely a longing to see the world, which did not go beyond seeing the streets of this town.
<p/>The appearance of the tipstaffs with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) brother in custody, whom one of them had overtaken as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ran away from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, now fully confirmed the truth of what the damsel said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had nothing on but a rich petticoat and a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head was uncovered and adorned only with its own hair, which looked like rings of gold, so bright and curly was it.
<p/>The governor, the majordomo, and the carver went aside with him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), and, unheard by his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) sister, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) came to be in that dress, and he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) with no less shame and embarrassment told exactly the same story as his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) sister, to the great delight of the enamoured carver; the governor, however, said to them, ``In truth, young lady and gentleman, this has been a very childish affair, and to explain your folly and rashness there was no necessity for all this delay and all these tears and sighs; for if you had said we are so-and-so, and we escaped from our father's house in this way in order to ramble about, out of mere curiosity and with no other object, there would have been an end of the matter, and none of these little sobs and tears and all the rest of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>said the damsel, <div class="bookquote">``but you see the confusion I was in was so great it did not let me behave as I ought.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the damsel</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' '' '' No harm has been done,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``come, we will leave you at your father's house;
<p/>perhaps they will not have missed you; and another time don't be so childish or eager to see the world; for a respectable damsel should have a broken leg and keep at home; and the woman and the hen by gadding about are soon lost; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who is eager to see is also eager to be seen; I say no more.
<p/>The youth thanked the governor for his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) kind offer to take them home, and they directed their steps towards the house, which was not far off.
<p/>On reaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, and immediately a woman-servant who was waiting for them came down and opened the door to them, and they went in, leaving the party marvelling as much at their grace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeing the world by night and without quitting the village; which, however, they set down to their youth.
<p/>The head-carver was left with a heart pierced through and through, and he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) father on the morrow, making sure she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) would not be refused him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a servant of the duke's; and even to Sancho ideas and schemes of marrying the youth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) resolved to open the negotiation at the proper season, persuading himself that no husband could be refused to a governor's daughter.
<p/>And so the night's round came to an end, and a couple of days later the government, whereby all his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) plans were overthrown and swept away, as will be seen farther on.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER L. WHEREIN IS SET FORTH WHO THE ENCHANTERS AND EXECUTIONERS WERE WHO FLOGGED THE DUENNA AND PINCHED DON QUIXOTE, AND ALSO WHAT BEFELL THE PAGE WHO CARRIED THE LETTER
<p/>WIFE Cide Hamete, the painstaking investigator of the minute points of this veracious history, says that when Dona Rodriguez left her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) own room to go to Don Quixote's, another duenna who slept with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>), and as all duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) so silently that the good Rodriguez never perceived it; and as soon as the duenna saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) enter Don Quixote's room, not to fail in a duenna's invariable practice of tattling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) hurried off that instant to report to the duchess how Dona Rodriguez was closeted with Don Quixote.
<p/>The duchess told the duke, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) and Altisidora go and see what the said duenna wanted with Don Quixote.
<p/>The duke gave them leave, and the pair cautiously and quietly crept to the door of the room and posted themselves so close to it that they could hear all that was said inside.
<p/>But when the duchess heard how the Rodriguez had made public the Aranjuez of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) issues she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) could not restrain herself, nor Altisidora either; and so, filled with rage and thirsting for vengeance, they burst into the room and tormented Don Quixote and flogged the duenna in the manner already described; for indignities offered to their charms and self-esteem mightily provoke the anger of women and make them eager for revenge.
<p/>The duchess told the duke what had happened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was much amused by it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), in pursuance of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) design of making merry and diverting herself with Don Quixote, despatched the page who had played the part of Dulcinea in the negotiations for her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) disenchantment -LRB-which Sancho Panza in the cares of government had forgotten all about-RRB- to Teresa Panza his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) wife with her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) husband's letter and another from herself, and also a great string of fine coral beads as a present.
<p/>Now the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; and eager to serve his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) lord and lady he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) set off very willingly for Sancho's village.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) entered it he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) observed a number of women washing in a brook, and asked them if they could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) whether there lived there a woman of the name of Teresa Panza, wife of one Sancho Panza, squire to a knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha.
<p/>At the question a young girl who was washing stood up and said, <div class="bookquote">``Teresa Panza is my mother, and that Sancho is my father, and that knight is our master.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Well then, miss,'' said the page, <div class="bookquote">``come and show me where your mother is, for I bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a letter and a present from your father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>That I will with all my heart, senor,'' said the girl, who seemed to be about fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was washing to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companions, and without putting anything on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head or feet, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bare-legged and had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair hanging about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), away she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) skipped in front of the page's horse, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Come, your worship, our house is at the entrance of the town, and my mother is there, sorrowful enough at not having had any news of my father this ever so long.
<p/>TO TERESA PANZA, SANCHO PANZA'S ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Well,'' said the page, ``I am bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) such good news that she (<font color='blue'><b>PANZA</b></font>) will have reason to thank God.
<p/>And then, skipping, running, and capering, the girl reached the town, but before going into the house she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) called out at the door, ``Come out, mother Teresa, come out, come out; here's a gentleman with letters and other things from my good father.
<p/>At these words her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) mother Teresa Panza came out spinning a bundle of flax, in a grey petticoat -LRB-so short was it one would have fancied <div class="bookquote">``they to her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) shame had cut it short'' (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, a grey bodice of the same stuff, and a smock.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was not very old, though plainly past forty, strong, healthy, vigorous, and sun-dried; and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) daughter and the page on horseback, she (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``What's this, child?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A servant of my lady, Dona Teresa Panza,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied the page; and suiting the action to the word he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) flung himself off his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) horse, and with great humility advanced to kneel before the lady Teresa, saying, ``Let me kiss your hand, Senora Dona Teresa, as the lawful and only wife of Senor Don Sancho Panza, rightful governor of the island of Barataria.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, senor, get up, do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Teresa; ``for I'm not a bit of a court lady, but only a poor country woman, the daughter of a clodcrusher, and the wife of a squire-errant and not of any governor at all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the page, <div class="bookquote">``the most worthy wife of a most arch-worthy governor; and as a proof of what I say accept this letter and this present;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) took out of his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) pocket a string of coral beads with gold clasps, and placed it on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) neck, and said, ``This letter is from his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) lordship the governor, and the other as well as these coral beads from my lady the duchess, who sends me to your worship.
<p/>Teresa stood lost in astonishment, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) daughter just as much, and the girl said, <div class="bookquote">``May I die but our master Don Quixote's at the bottom of this; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must have given father the government or county he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) so often promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>That is the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the page; ``for it is through Senor Don Quixote that Senor Sancho is now governor of the island of Barataria, as will be seen by this letter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Teresa; <div class="bookquote">``for though I can spin I can't read, not a scrap.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' What gentleman is this? '' '' '' '' '' '' '' Nor I either,'' said Sanchica; <div class="bookquote">``but wait a bit, and I'll go and fetch some one who can read it,
<p/>either the curate himself or the bachelor Samson Carrasco, and they'll come gladly to hear any news of my father. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sanchica</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no need to fetch anybody,'' said the page; <div class="bookquote">``for though I can't spin I can read, and I'll read it;''  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>and so he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) read it through, but as it has been already given it is not inserted here;
<p/>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took out the other one from the duchess, which ran as follows: Friend Teresa,--Your husband Sancho's good qualities, of heart as well as of head, induced and compelled me to request my husband the duke to give him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the government of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) many islands.
<p/>I am told he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) governs like a gerfalcon, of which I am very glad, and my lord the duke, of course, also; and I am very thankful to heaven that I have not made a mistake in choosing him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) for that same government; for I would have Senora Teresa know that a good governor is hard to find in this world and may God make me as good as Sancho's way of governing.
<p/>Herewith I send you, my dear, a string of coral beads with gold clasps; I wish they were Oriental pearls; but <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who gives thee a bone does not wish to see thee dead;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>a time will come when we shall become acquainted and meet one another, but God knows the future.
<p/>Commend me to your daughter Sanchica, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) from me to hold herself in readiness, for I mean to make a high match for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) least expects it.
<p/>They tell me there are big acorns in your village; send me a couple of dozen or so, and I shall value them greatly as coming from your hand; and write to me at length to assure me of your health and well-being; and if there be anything you stand in need of, it is but to open your mouth, and that shall be the measure; and so God keep you.
<p/>'' said Teresa when she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) heard the letter; <div class="bookquote">``that I may be buried with ladies of that sort, and not the gentlewomen we have in this town, that fancy because they are gentlewomen
<p/>the wind must not touch them, and go to church with as much airs as if they were queens, no less, and seem to think they are disgraced if they look at a farmer's wife!
<p/>And see here how this good lady, for all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a duchess, calls me `friend,' and treats me as if I was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) equal--and equal

<p/>And as for the acorns, senor, I'll send her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship a peck and such big ones that one might come to see them as a show and a wonder.
<p/>And now, Sanchica, see that the gentleman is comfortable; put up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) horse, and get some eggs out of the stable, and cut plenty of bacon, and let's give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dinner like a prince; for the good news he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has brought, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own bonny face deserve it all; and meanwhile I'll run out and give the neighbours the news of our good luck, and father curate, and Master Nicholas the barber, who are and always have been such friends of thy father's.
<p/>mind, you must give me half of that string; for I don't think my lady the duchess could have been so stupid as to send it all to you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but let me wear it round my neck for a few days; for verily it seems to make my heart glad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be glad too,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the page, <div class="bookquote">``when you see the bundle there is in this portmanteau, for it is a suit of the finest cloth, that the governor only wore one day out hunting and now sends, all for Senora Sanchica.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That I will, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sanchica</b></font>)</div>said Sanchica; ``but <div class="bookquote">``It is all for thee, my child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sanchica</b></font>)</div>said Teresa; '' <div class="bookquote">``May he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) live a thousand years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sanchica, ``and the bearer as many, nay two thousand, if needful.
<p/>With this Teresa hurried out of the house with the letters, and with the string of beads round her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) neck, and went along thrumming the letters as if they were a tambourine, and by chance coming across the curate and Samson Carrasco she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) began capering and saying, <div class="bookquote">``None of us poor now, faith!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>We've got a little government! Ay, let the finest fine lady tackle me, and I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a setting down!''

(<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``God help us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate, <div class="bookquote">``we don't understand you, Teresa, or know what you are talking about.
<p/>The curate read them out for Samson Carrasco to hear, and Samson and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) regarded one another with looks of astonishment at what they had read, and the bachelor asked who had brought the letters.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There, you may see it yourselves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Teresa, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) handed them the letters. Teresa in reply bade them come with her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) house
<p/>and they would see the messenger, a most elegant youth, who had brought another present which was worth as much more.
<p/>The curate took the coral beads from her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) neck and examined them again and again, and having satisfied himself as to their fineness he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) fell to wondering afresh, and said, <div class="bookquote">``By the gown I wear I don't know what to say or think of these letters and presents; on the one hand I can see and feel the fineness of these coral beads, and on the other I read how a duchess sends to beg for a couple of dozen of acorns.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Square that if you can,'' said Carrasco; ``well, let's go and see the messenger, and from him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) we'll learn something about this mystery that has turned up.
<p/>They found the page sifting a little barley for his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) horse, and Sanchica cutting a rasher of bacon to be paved with eggs for his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) dinner.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) looks and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) handsome apparel pleased them both greatly; and after they had saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) courteously, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) them, Samson begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) to give them his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) news, as well of Don Quixote as of Sancho Panza, for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) said, though they had read the letters from Sancho and her (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) ladyship the duchess, they were still puzzled and could not make out what was meant by Sancho's government, and above all of an island, when all or most of those in the Mediterranean belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Majesty.
<p/>To this the page replied, ``As to Senor Sancho Panza's being a governor there is no doubt whatever; but whether it is an island or not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) governs, with that I have nothing to do; suffice it that it is a town of more than a thousand inhabitants; with regard to the acorns I may tell you my lady the duchess is so unpretending and unassuming that, not to speak of sending to beg for acorns from a peasant woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been known to send to ask for the loan of a comb from one of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neighbours; for I would have your worships know that the ladies of Aragon, though they are just as illustrious, are not so punctilious and haughty as the Castilian ladies; they treat people with greater familiarity.
<p/>In the middle of this conversation Sanchica came in with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skirt full of eggs, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the page, <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, senor, does my father wear trunk-hose since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been governor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' They did so, and Teresa returned with them. '' <div class="bookquote">``I have not noticed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the page; <div class="bookquote">``but no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wears them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sanchica</b></font>)</div>said Sanchica, <div class="bookquote">``what a sight it must be to see my father in tights! Isn't it odd that ever since I was born
<p/>As things go you will see that if you live,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sanchica</b></font>)</div>said the page; ``by God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is in the way to take the road with a sunshade if the government only lasts him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) two months more.
<p/>The curate and the bachelor could see plainly enough that the page spoke in a waggish vein; but the fineness of the coral beads, and the hunting suit that Sancho sent -LRB-for Teresa had already shown it to them-RRB- did away with the impression; and they could not help laughing at Sanchica's wish, and still more when Teresa said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor curate, look about if there's anybody here going to Madrid or Toledo, to buy me a hooped petticoat, a proper fashionable one of the best quality; for indeed and indeed I must do honour to my husband's government as well as I can; nay, if I am put to it and have to, I'll go to Court and set a coach like all the world; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) who has a governor for her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) husband may very well have one and keep one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' said Sanchica; <div class="bookquote">``would to God it were to-day instead of to-morrow, even though they were to say when they saw me seated in the coach with my mother, `See that rubbish, that garlic-stuffed fellow's daughter, how she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) goes stretched at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ease in a coach as if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was a she-pope!'
<p/>I have had a longing to see my father in trunk-hose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sanchica</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' And why not, mother! But let them tramp through the mud, and let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground.
<p/>Bad luck to backbiters all over the world; `let me go warm and the people may laugh.' Do I say right, mother?''
<p/>To be sure you do, my child,'' said Teresa; ``and all this good luck, and even more, my good Sancho foretold me; and thou wilt see, my daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) won't stop till he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) has made me a countess; for to make a beginning is everything in luck; and as I have heard thy good father say many a time -LRB-for besides being thy father
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s the father of proverbs too-RRB-, `When they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; when they offer thee a government, take it; when they would give thee a county, seize it; when they say, <div class="bookquote">``Here, here!
<p/>Oh no! go to sleep, and don't answer the strokes of good fortune and the lucky chances that are knocking at the door of your house!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>And what do I care,'' added Sanchica, ``whether anybody says when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sees me holding my head up, `The dog saw himself in hempen breeches,' and the rest of it?
<p/>Hearing this the curate said, <div class="bookquote">``I do believe that all this family of the Panzas are born with a sackful of proverbs in their insides, every one of them; I never saw one of them that does not pour them out at all times and on all occasions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Governor</b></font>)</div>said the page, ``for Senor Governor Sancho utters them at every turn; and though a great many of them are not to the purpose, still they amuse one, and my lady the duchess and the duke praise them highly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you still maintain that all this about Sancho's government is true, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bachelor</b></font>)</div>said the bachelor, <div class="bookquote">``and that there actually is a duchess who sends him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) presents and writes to him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and do penance with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate at this; ``for Senora Teresa has more will than means to serve so worthy a guest.
<p/>The page refused, but had to consent at last for his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) own sake; and the curate took him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) home with him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) very gladly, in order to have an opportunity of questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) at leisure about Don Quixote and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) doings.
<p/>The bachelor offered to write the letters in reply for Teresa; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) did not care to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mix himself up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) affairs,
<p/>for she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) somewhat given to joking; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) gave a cake and a couple of eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wrote for her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) two letters, one for her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) husband and the other for the duchess, dictated out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) own head, which are not the worst inserted in this great history, as will be seen farther on.
<p/>OF THE PROGRESS OF SANCHO'S GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER SUCH ENTERTAINING MATTERS Day came after the night of the governor's round; a night which the head-carver passed without sleeping, so were his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) thoughts of the face and air and beauty of the disguised damsel, while the majordomo spent what was left of it in writing an account to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) lord and lady of all Sancho said and did, being as much amazed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sayings as at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) doings, for there was a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) words and deeds.
<p/>The senor governor got up, and by Doctor Pedro Recio's directions they made him (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) break his (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) fast on a little conserve and four sups of cold water, which Sancho would have readily exchanged for a piece of bread and a bunch of grapes; but seeing there was no help for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) submitted with no little sorrow of heart and discomfort of stomach; Pedro Recio having persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) that light and delicate diet enlivened the wits, and that was what was most essential for persons placed in command and in responsible situations, where they have to employ not only the bodily powers but those of the mind also.
<p/>By means of this sophistry Sancho was made to endure hunger, and hunger so keen that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cursed the government, and even him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) who had given it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); however, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hunger and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) conserve he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) undertook to deliver judgments that day, and the first thing that came before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was a question that was submitted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) by a stranger, in the presence of the majordomo and the other attendants, and it was in these words:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Senor, a large river separated two districts of one and the same lordship--will your worship please to pay attention, for the case is an important and a rather knotty one?
<p/>Well then, on this river there was a bridge, and at one end of it a gallows, and a sort of tribunal, where four judges commonly sat to administer the law which the lord of river, bridge and the lordship had enacted, and which was to this effect, `If anyone crosses by this bridge from one side to the other he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) shall declare on oath where he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) is going to and with what object; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) swears truly, he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) shall be allowed to pass, but if falsely, he (<font color='blue'><b>lordship</b></font>) shall be put to death for it by hanging on the gallows erected there, without any remission.'
<p/>Though the law and its severe penalty were known, many persons crossed, but in their declarations it was easy to see at once they were telling the truth, and the judges let them pass free.
<p/>It happened, however, that one man, when they came to take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declaration, swore and said that by the oath he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else.
<p/>The judges held a consultation over the oath, and they said, `If we let this man pass free he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has sworn falsely, and by the law he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to die; but if we hang him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swore he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to die on that gallows, and therefore swore the truth, by the same law he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to go free.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the attendants</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER LI. It is asked of your worship, senor governor, what are the judges to do with this man?
<p/>For they are still in doubt and perplexity; and having heard of your worship's acute and exalted intellect, they have sent me to entreat your worship on their behalf to give your opinion on this very intricate and puzzling case.
<p/>To this Sancho made answer, ``Indeed those gentlemen the judges that send you to me might have spared themselves the trouble, for I have more of the obtuse than the acute in me; but repeat the case over again, so that I may understand it, and then perhaps I may be able to hit the point.
<p/>The querist repeated again and again what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had said before, and then Sancho said, <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me I can set the matter right in a moment, and in this way; the man swears that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is going to die upon the gallows; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dies upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don't hang him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged.''

<p/>you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) and for absolving him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) are exactly balanced, they should let him (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil; this I would give signed with my name if I knew how to sign; and what I have said in this case is not out of my own head, but one of the many precepts my master Don Quixote gave me the night before I left to become governor of this island
<p/>, that came into my mind, and it was this, that when there was any doubt about the justice of a case I should lean to mercy; and it is God's will that I should recollect it now, for it fits this case as if it was made for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the majordomo; <div class="bookquote">``and I maintain that Lycurgus himself, who gave laws to the Lacedemonians, could not have pronounced a better decision than the great Panza has given; let the morning's audience close with this, and I will see that the senor governor has dinner entirely to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) liking.
<p/>That's all I ask for--fair play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``give me my dinner, and then let it rain cases and questions on me, and I'll despatch them in a twinkling.
<p/>The majordomo kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) word, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt it against his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) conscience to kill so wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) intended to have done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that same night, playing off the last joke he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was commissioned to practise upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>It came to pass, then, that after he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had dined that day, in opposition to the rules and aphorisms of Doctor Tirteafuera, as they were taking away the cloth there came a courier with a letter from Don Quixote for the governor.
<p/>Sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and if there was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud.
<p/>The secretary did so, and after he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) had skimmed the contents he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It may well be read aloud, for what Senor Don Quixote writes to your worship deserves to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it is as follows.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Look here, my good sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; '' '' '' '' DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA'S LETTER TO SANCHO PANZA, GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND OF BARATARIA.
<p/>When I was expecting to hear of thy stupidities and blunders, friend Sancho, I have received intelligence of thy displays of good sense, for which I give special thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the dunghill and of fools to make wise men.
<p/>They tell me thou dost govern as if thou wert a man, and art a man as if thou wert a beast, so great is the humility wherewith thou dost comport thyself.
<p/>But I would have thee bear in mind, Sancho, that very often it is fitting and necessary for the authority of office to resist the humility of the heart; for the seemly array of one who is invested with grave duties should be such as they require and not measured by what his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own humble tastes may lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to prefer.
<p/>; a stick dressed up does not look like a stick; I do not say thou shouldst wear trinkets or fine raiment, or that being a judge thou shouldst dress like a soldier, but that thou shouldst array thyself in the apparel thy office requires, and that at the same time it be neat and handsome.
<p/>there are two things, among others, that thou must do; one is to be civil to all -LRB-this, however, I told thee before-RRB-, and the other to take care that food be abundant, for there is nothing that vexes the heart of the poor more than hunger and high prices.
<p/>Make not many proclamations; but those thou makest take care that they be good ones, and above all that they be observed and carried out; for proclamations that are not observed are the same as if they did not exist; nay, they encourage the idea that the prince who had the wisdom and authority to make them had not the power to enforce them; and laws that threaten and are not enforced come to be like the log, the king of the frogs, that frightened them at first, but that in time they despised and mounted upon.
<p/>Dress well To win the good-will of the people thou governest Be a father to virtue and a stepfather to vice.
<p/>Be not always strict, nor yet always lenient, but observe a mean between these two extremes, for in that is the aim of wisdom.
<p/>Visit the gaols, the slaughter-houses, and the market-places; for the presence of the governor is of great importance in such places; it comforts the prisoners who are in hopes of a speedy release, it is the bugbear of the butchers who have then to give just weight, and it is the terror of the market-women for the same reason.
<p/>Let it not be seen that thou art -LRB-even if perchance thou art, which I do not believe-RRB- covetous, a follower of women, or a glutton; for when the people and those that have dealings with thee become aware of thy special weakness they will bring their batteries to bear upon thee in that quarter, till they have brought thee down to the depths of perdition.
<p/>Consider and reconsider, con and con over again the advices and the instructions I gave thee before thy departure hence to thy government, and thou wilt see that in them, if thou dost follow them, thou hast a help at hand that will lighten for thee the troubles and difficulties that beset governors at every step.
<p/>Write to thy lord and lady and show thyself grateful to them, for ingratitude is the daughter of pride, and one of the greatest sins we know of; and he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) who is grateful to those who have been good to him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) shows that he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) will be so to God also who has bestowed and still bestows so many blessings upon him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>).
<p/>My lady the duchess sent off a messenger with thy suit and another present to thy wife Teresa Panza; we expect the answer every moment.
<p/>I have been a little indisposed through a certain scratching I came in for, not very much to the benefit of my nose; but it was nothing; for if there are enchanters who maltreat me, there are also some who defend me.
<p/>Let me know if the majordomo who is with thee had any share in the Trifaldi performance, as thou didst suspect; and keep me informed of everything that happens thee, as the distance is so short; all the more as I am thinking of giving over very shortly this idle life I am now leading, for I was not born for it.
<p/>A thing has occurred to me which I am inclined to think will put me out of favour with the duke and duchess; but though I am sorry for it
<p/>I do not care, for after all I must obey my calling rather than their pleasure, in accordance with the common saying, amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas.
<p/>I quote this Latin to thee because I conclude that since thou hast been a governor thou wilt have learned it.
<p/>Sancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praised and considered wise by all who heard it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) then rose up from table, and calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) secretary shut himself in with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own room, and without putting it off any longer set about answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master Don Quixote at once; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bade the secretary write down what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) without adding or suppressing anything, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did, and the answer was to the following effect.
<p/>Adieu; God keep thee from being an object of pity to anyone. Thy friend, DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA. SANCHO PANZA'S LETTER
<p/>The pressure of business is so great upon me that I have no time to scratch my head or even to cut my nails; and I have them so long-
<p/>I say this, master of my soul, that you may not be surprised if I have not until now sent you word of how I fare, well or ill, in this government, in which I am suffering more hunger than when we two were wandering through the woods and wastes.
<p/>My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain spies had got into this island to kill me; but up to the present I have not found out any except a certain doctor who receives a salary in this town for killing all the governors that come here; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is called Doctor Pedro Recio, and is from Tirteafuera; so you see what a name he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has to make me dread dying under his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands.
<p/>This doctor says of himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) does not cure diseases when there are any, but prevents them coming, and the medicines he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) uses are diet and more diet until he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brings one down to bare bones; as if leanness was not worse than fever.
<p/>TO DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA. God send a remedy for it. In short he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of vexation;
<p/>for when I thought I was coming to this government to get my meat hot and my drink cool, and take my ease between holland sheets on feather beds, I find I have come to do penance as if I was a hermit; and as I don't do it willingly I suspect that in the end the devil will carry me off.
<p/>So far I have not handled any dues or taken any bribes, and I don't know what to think of it; for here they tell me that the governors that come to this island, before entering it have plenty of money either given to them or lent to them by the people of the town, and that this is the usual custom
<p/>Last night going the rounds I came upon a fair damsel in man's clothes, and a brother of hers dressed as a woman; my head-carver has fallen in love with the girl, and has in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own mind chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for a wife, so he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) says, and I have chosen the youth for a son-in-law; to-day we are going to explain our intentions to the father of the pair, who is one Diego de la Llana, a gentleman and an old Christian as much as you please.
<p/>I have visited the market-places, as your worship advises me, and yesterday I found a stall-keeper selling new hazel nuts and proved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to have mixed a bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel of new; I confiscated the whole for the children of the charity-school, who will know how to distinguish them well enough, and I sentenced her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) not to come into the market-place for a fortnight; they told me I did bravely.
<p/>I can tell your worship it is commonly said in this town that there are no people worse than the market-women, for they are all barefaced, unconscionable, and impudent, and I can well believe it from what I have seen of them in other towns.
<p/>I am very glad my lady the duchess has written to my wife Teresa Panza and sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) the present your worship speaks of; and I will strive to show myself grateful when the time comes; kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) hands for me, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) I say she (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) has not thrown it into a sack with a hole in it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) will see in the end.
<p/>I should not like your worship to have any difference with my lord and lady; for if you fall out with them it is plain it must do me harm; and as you give me advice to be grateful it will not do for your worship not to be so yourself to those who have shown you such kindness, and by whom you have been treated so hospitably in their castle.
<p/>; but I suppose it must be one of the ill-turns the wicked enchanters are always doing your worship; when we meet I shall know all about it.
<p/>I wish I could send your worship something; but I don't know what to send, unless it be some very curious clyster pipes, to work with bladders, that they make in this island; but if the office remains with me I'll find out something to send, one way or another.
<p/>If my wife Teresa Panza writes to me, pay the postage and send me the letter, for I have a very great desire to hear how my house and wife and children are going on.
<p/>And so, may God deliver your worship from evil-minded enchanters, and bring me well and peacefully out of this government, which I doubt, for I expect to take leave of it and my life together, from the way Doctor Pedro Recio treats me.
<p/>not only here but with all who enter upon governments. That about the scratching I don't understand Your worship's servant SANCHO PANZA THE GOVERNOR.
<p/>The secretary sealed the letter, and immediately dismissed the courier; and those who were carrying on the joke against Sancho putting their heads together arranged how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was to be dismissed from the government.
<p/>Sancho spent the afternoon in drawing up certain ordinances relating to the good government of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancied the island; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ordained that there were to be no provision hucksters in the State, and that men might import wine into it from any place they pleased, provided they declared the quarter it came from, so that a price might be put upon it according to its quality, reputation, and the estimation it was held in; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that watered his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wine, or changed the name, was to forfeit his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) life for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) reduced the prices of all manner of shoes, boots, and stockings, but of shoes in particular, as they seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to run extravagantly high.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) established a fixed rate for servants' wages, which were becoming recklessly exorbitant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) laid extremely heavy penalties upon those who sang lewd or loose songs either by day or night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) decreed that no blind man should sing of any miracle in verse, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could produce authentic evidence that it was true, for it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) opinion that most of those the blind men sing are trumped up, to the detriment of the true ones.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) established and created an alguacil of the poor, not to harass them, but to examine them and see whether they really were so; for many a sturdy thief or drunkard goes about under cover of a make-believe crippled limb or a sham sore.
<p/>In a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) made so many good rules that to this day they are preserved there, and are called The constitutions of the great governor Sancho Panza.
<p/>, OTHERWISE CALLED DONA RODRIGUEZ Cide Hamete relates that Don Quixote being now cured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) scratches felt that the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was leading in the castle was entirely inconsistent with the order of chivalry he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) professed, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) determined to ask the duke and duchess to permit him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) departure for Saragossa, as the time of the festival was now drawing near, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hoped to win there the suit of armour which is the prize at festivals of the sort.
<p/>But one day at table with the duke and duchess, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was about to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) resolution into effect and ask for their permission, lo and behold suddenly there came in through the door of the great hall two women, as they afterwards proved to be, draped in mourning from head to foot, one of whom approaching Don Quixote flung herself at full length at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) lips to them, and uttering moans so sad, so deep, and so doleful that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) put all who heard and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) into a state of perplexity; and though the duke and duchess supposed it must be some joke their servants were playing off upon Don Quixote, still the earnest way the woman sighed and moaned and wept puzzled them and made them feel uncertain, until Don Quixote, touched with compassion, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up and made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unveil herself and remove the mantle from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tearful face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) complied and disclosed what no one could have ever anticipated, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) disclosed the countenance of Dona Rodriguez, the duenna of the house; the other female in mourning being her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) daughter, who had been made a fool of by the rich farmer's son.
<p/>All who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) were filled with astonishment, and the duke and duchess more than any; for though they thought her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) a simpleton and a weak creature, they did not think her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) capable of crazy pranks.
<p/>Dona Rodriguez, at length, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) master and mistress said to them, <div class="bookquote">``Will your excellences be pleased to permit me to speak to this gentleman for a moment, for it is requisite I should do so in order to get successfully out of the business in which the boldness of an evil-minded clown has involved me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>The duke said that for his (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) part he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) leave, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) might speak with Senor Don Quixote as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) liked.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) then, turning to Don Quixote and addressing herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, ``Some days since, valiant knight, I gave you an account of the injustice and treachery of a wicked farmer to my dearly beloved daughter, the unhappy damsel here before you, and you promised me to take her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) part and right the wrong that has been done her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>); but now it has come to my hearing that you are about to depart from this castle in quest of such fair adventures as God may vouchsafe to you
<p/>; therefore, before you take the road, I would that you challenge this froward rustic, and compel him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to marry my daughter in fulfillment of the promise he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to become her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband before he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seduced her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); for to expect that my lord the duke will do me justice is to ask pears from the elm tree, for the reason I stated privately to your worship; and so may our Lord grant you good health and forsake us not.
<p/>To these words Don Quixote replied very gravely and solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``Worthy duenna, check your tears, or rather dry them, and spare your sighs, for I take it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter, for whom it would have been better not to have been so ready to believe lovers' promises, which are for the most part quickly made and very slowly performed; and so, with my lord the duke's leave, I will at once go in quest of this inhuman youth, and will find him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) out and challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) and slay him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), if so be he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) refuses to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) promised word; for the chief object of my profession is to spare the humble and chastise the proud; I mean, to help the distressed and destroy the oppressors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no necessity,'' said the duke, ``for your worship to take the trouble of seeking out the rustic of whom this worthy duenna complains, nor is there any necessity, either, for asking my leave to challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>); for I admit him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) duly challenged, and will take care that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is informed of the challenge, and accepts it, and comes to answer it in person to this castle of mine, where I shall afford to both a fair field, observing all the conditions which are usually and properly observed in such trials, and observing too justice to both sides, as all princes who offer a free field to combatants within the limits of their lordships are bound to do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then with that assurance and your highness's good leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I hereby for this once waive my privilege of gentle blood, and come down and put myself on a level with the lowly birth of the wrong-doer, making myself equal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and enabling him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to enter into combat with me; and so, I challenge and defy him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), though absent, on the plea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) malfeasance in breaking faith with this poor damsel, who was a maiden and now by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) misdeed is none; and say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shall fulfill the promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) to become her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) lawful husband, or else stake his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) life upon the question.
<p/>And then plucking off a glove he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) threw it down in the middle of the hall, and the duke picked it up, saying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had said before, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) accepted the challenge in the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) vassal, and fixed six days thence as the time, the courtyard of the castle as the place, and for arms the customary ones of knights, lance and shield and full armour, with all the other accessories, without trickery, guile, or charms of any sort, and examined and passed by the judges of the field.
<p/>But first of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is requisite that this worthy duenna and unworthy damsel should place their claim for justice in the hands of Don Quixote; for otherwise nothing can be done, nor can the said challenge be brought to a lawful issue.
<p/>CHAPTER LII. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND DISTRESSED OR AFFLICTED DUENNA ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I do so place it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duenna</b></font>)</div>replied the duenna.
<p/>This declaration having been made, and the duke having settled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would do in the matter, the ladies in black withdrew, and the duchess gave orders that for the future they were not to be treated as servants of hers, but as lady adventurers who came to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house to demand justice; so they gave them a room to themselves and waited on them as they would on strangers, to the consternation of the other women-servants, who did not know where the folly and imprudence of Dona Rodriguez and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) unlucky daughter would stop.
<p/>And now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to a satisfactory end, lo and behold the page who had carried the letters and presents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho, entered the hall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), being anxious to know the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) journey; but when they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the page said in reply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not give it before so many people or in a few words, and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait for a private opportunity, and in the meantime amuse themselves with these letters; and taking out the letters he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) placed them in the duchess's hand.
<p/>'' And I too,'' added her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) daughter, all in tears and covered with shame and confusion. One bore by way of address, Letter for my lady the Duchess So-and-so, of
<p/>I don't know where; and the other To my husband Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria, whom God prosper longer than me.
<p/>The duchess's bread would not bake, as the saying is, until she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) had read her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) letter; and having looked over it herself and seen that it might be read aloud for the duke and all present to hear, she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) read out as follows.
<p/>TERESA PANZA'S LETTER TO THE DUCHESS. The letter your highness wrote me, my lady, gave me great pleasure, for indeed I found it very welcome.
<p/>All this village is very much pleased that your ladyship has made a governor of my good man Sancho; though nobody will believe it, particularly the curate, and Master Nicholas the barber, and the bachelor Samson Carrasco; but I don't care for that, for so long as it is true, as it is, they may all say what they like; though, to tell the truth, if the coral beads and the suit had not come I would not have believed it either; for in this village everybody thinks my husband a numskull, and except for governing a flock of goats, they cannot fancy what sort of government he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) can be fit for.
<p/>The string of coral beads is very fine, and my husband's hunting suit does not fall short of it. God grant it, and direct him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) according as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sees his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) children stand in need of it.
<p/>I am resolved with your worship's leave, lady of my soul, to make the most of this fair day, and go to Court to stretch myself at ease in a coach, and make all those I have envying me already burst their eyes out; so I beg your excellence to order my husband to send me a small trifle of money, and to let it be something to speak of, because one's expenses are heavy at the Court; for a loaf costs a real, and meat thirty maravedis a pound, which is beyond everything; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) does not want me to go let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tell me in time, for my feet are on the fidgets to be off; and my friends and neighbours tell me that if my daughter and I make a figure and a brave show at Court, my husband will come to be known far more by me than I by him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), for of course plenty of people will ask, <div class="bookquote">``Who are those ladies in that coach?''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>and some servant of mine will answer, <div class="bookquote">``The wife and daughter of Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria;''  (<font color='red'><b>some servant</b></font>)</div>and in this way Sancho will become known, and I'll be thought well of, and <div class="bookquote">``to Rome for everything.
<p/>I am as vexed as vexed can be that they have gathered no acorns this year in our village; for all that I send your highness about half a peck that I went to the wood to gather and pick out one by one myself, and I could find no bigger ones; I wish they were as big as ostrich eggs.
<p/>Let not your high mightiness forget to write to me; and I will take care to answer, and let you know how I am, and whatever news there may be in this place, where I remain, praying our Lord to have your highness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) keeping and not to forget me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Sancha my daughter, and my son, kiss your worship's hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) who would rather see your ladyship than write to you, Your servant, TERESA PANZA.
<p/>All were greatly amused by Teresa Panza's letter, but particularly the duke and duchess; and the duchess asked Don Quixote's opinion whether they might open the letter that had come for the governor, which she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) suspected must be very good.
<p/>Don Quixote said that to gratify them he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.
<p/>I got thy letter, Sancho of my soul, and I promise thee and swear as a Catholic Christian that I was within two fingers' breadth of going mad
<p/>I can tell thee, brother, when I came to hear that thou wert a governor I thought I should have dropped dead with pure joy; and thou knowest they say sudden joy kills as well as great sorrow; and as for Sanchica thy daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) leaked from sheer happiness.
<p/>TERESA PANZA'S LETTER TO HER HUSBAND SANCHO PANZA. I was so happy. I had before me the suit thou didst send me, and the coral beads my lady the duchess sent me
<p/>round my neck, and the letters in my hands, and there was the bearer of them standing by, and in spite of all this
<p/>I verily believed and thought that what I saw and handled was all a dream; for who could have thought that a goatherd would come to be a governor of islands?
<p/>, what my mother used to say, that one must live long to see much; I say it because I expect to see more if I live longer; for I don't expect to stop until I see thee a farmer of taxes or a collector of revenue, which are offices where, though the devil carries off those who make a bad use of them, still they make and handle money.
<p/>My lady the duchess will tell thee the desire I have to go to the Court; consider the matter and let me know thy pleasure; I will try to do honour to thee by going in a coach.
<p/>Neither the curate, nor the barber, nor the bachelor, nor even the sacristan, can believe that thou art a governor, and they say the whole thing is a delusion or an enchantment affair, like everything belonging to thy master Don Quixote; and Samson says he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) must go in search of thee and drive the government out of thy head and the madness out of Don Quixote's skull; I only laugh, and look at my string of beads, and plan out the dress I am going to make for our daughter out of thy suit.
<p/>Thou knowest, my friend I sent some acorns to my lady the duchess; I wish they had been gold. Send me some strings of pearls if they are in fashion in that island.
<p/>Here is the news of the village; La Berrueca has married her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) daughter to a good-for-nothing painter, who came here to paint anything that might turn up.
<p/>The council gave him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) an order to paint his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) Majesty's arms over the door of the town-hall; he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) asked two ducats, which they paid him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) in advance; he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) worked for eight days, and at the end of them had nothing painted, and then said he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had no turn for painting such trifling things; he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) returned the money, and for all that has married on the pretence of being a good workman; to be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) has now laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) paint-brush and taken a spade in hand, and goes to the field like a gentleman.
<p/>Minguilla, Mingo Silvato's granddaughter, found it out, and has gone to law with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on the score of having given her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) promise of marriage.
<p/>Pedro Lobo's son has received the first orders and tonsure, with the intention of becoming a priest. Evil tongues say she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) is with child by him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) denies it stoutly.
<p/>There are no olives this year, and there is not a drop of vinegar to be had in the whole village.
<p/>A company of soldiers passed through here; when they left they took away with them three of the girls of the village; I will not tell thee who they are; perhaps they will come back, and they will be sure to find those who will take them for wives with all their blemishes, good or bad.
<p/>Sanchica is making bonelace; she (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) earns eight maravedis a day clear, which she (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) puts into a moneybox as a help towards house furnishing; but now that she (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is a governor's daughter thou wilt give her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) a portion without her (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) working for it.
<p/>The fountain in the plaza has run dry. A flash of lightning struck the gibbet, and I wish they all lit there.
<p/>I look for an answer to this, and to know thy mind about my going to the Court; and so, God keep thee longer than me, or as long, for I would not leave thee in this world without me.
<p/>The letters were applauded, laughed over, relished, and admired; and then, as if to put the seal to the business, the courier arrived, bringing the one Sancho sent to Don Quixote, and this, too, was read out, and it raised some doubts as to the governor's simplicity.
<p/>The duchess withdrew to hear from the page about his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) adventures in Sancho's village, which he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) narrated at full length without leaving a single circumstance unmentioned.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) the acorns, and also a cheese which Teresa had given him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) as being particularly good and superior to those of Tronchon.
<p/>The duchess received it with greatest delight, in which we will leave her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), to describe the end of the government of the great Sancho Panza, flower and mirror of all governors of islands.
<p/>To fancy that in this life anything belonging to it will remain for ever in the same state is an idle fancy; on the contrary, in it everything seems to go in a circle, I mean round and round.
<p/>The spring succeeds the summer, the summer the fall, the fall the autumn, the autumn the winter, and the winter the spring, and so time rolls with never-ceasing wheel.
<p/>Man's life alone, swifter than time, speeds onward to its end without any hope of renewal, save it be in that other life which is endless and boundless.
<p/>Thus saith Cide Hamete the Mahometan philosopher; for there are many that by the light of nature alone, without the light of faith, have a comprehension of the fleeting nature and instability of this present life and the endless duration of that eternal life we hope for; but our author is here speaking of the rapidity with which Sancho's government came to an end, melted away, disappeared, vanished as it were in smoke and shadow.
<p/>For as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lay in bed on the night of the seventh day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) government, sated, not with bread and wine, but with delivering judgments and giving opinions and making laws and proclamations, just as sleep, in spite of hunger, was beginning to close his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyelids, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heard such a noise of bell-ringing and shouting that one would have fancied the whole island was going to the bottom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sat up in bed and remained listening intently to try if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could make out what could be the cause of so great an uproar; not only, however, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) unable to discover what it was, but as countless drums and trumpets now helped to swell the din of the bells and shouts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was more puzzled than ever, and filled with fear and terror; and getting up he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) put on a pair of slippers because of the dampness of the floor, and without throwing a dressing gown or anything of the kind over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) rushed out of the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) room, just in time to see approaching along a corridor a band of more than twenty persons with lighted torches and naked swords in their hands, all shouting out, ``To arms, to arms, senor governor, to arms!
<p/>The enemy is in the island in countless numbers, and we are lost unless your skill and valour come to our support.
<p/>Keeping up this noise, tumult, and uproar, they came to where Sancho stood dazed and bewildered by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw and heard, and as they approached one of them called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Arm at once, your lordship, if you would not have yourself destroyed and the whole island lost.
<p/>Thy wife, TERESA PANZA. CHAPTER LIII. OF THE TROUBLOUS END AND TERMINATION SANCHO PANZA'S GOVERNMENT CAME TO ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' What have I to do with arming?'' said Sancho.
<p/>'' What do I know about arms or supports? Better leave all that to my master Don Quixote, who will settle it and make all safe in a trice
<p/>; for I, sinner that I am, God help me, don't understand these scuffles.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, senor governor,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another, <div class="bookquote">``what slackness of mettle this is!
<p/>Arm yourself; here are arms for you, offensive and defensive; come out to the plaza and be our leader and captain; it falls upon you by right, for you are our governor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arm me then, in God's name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, and they at once produced two large shields they had come provided with, and placed them upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shirt, without letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) put on anything else, one shield in front and the other behind, and passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arms through openings they had made, they bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tight with ropes, so that there he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was walled and boarded up as straight as a spindle and unable to bend his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees or stir a single step.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand they placed a lance, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) leant to keep himself from falling, and as soon as they had him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thus fixed
<p/>they bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) march forward and lead them on and give them all courage; for with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) for their guide and lamp and morning star, they were sure to bring their business to a successful issue.
<p/>'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``when I can't stir my knee-caps, for these boards I have bound so tight to my body won't let me.
<p/>What you must do is carry me in your arms, and lay me across or set me upright in some postern, and I'll hold it either with this lance or with my body.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On, senor governor!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried another, <div class="bookquote">``it is fear more than the boards that keeps you from moving; make haste, stir yourself, for there is no time to lose; the enemy is increasing in numbers, the shouts grow louder, and the danger is pressing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the governor</b></font>)</div>Urged by these exhortations and reproaches the poor governor made an attempt to advance, but fell to the ground with such a crash that he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) had broken himself all to pieces.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) lay like a tortoise enclosed in its shell, or a side of bacon between two kneading-troughs, or a boat bottom up on the beach; nor did the gang of jokers feel any compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) when they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) down; so far from that, extinguishing their torches they began to shout afresh and to renew the calls to arms with such energy, trampling on poor Sancho, and slashing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) over the shield with their swords in such a way that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had not gathered himself together and made himself small and drawn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head between the shields, it would have fared badly with the poor governor, as, squeezed into that narrow compass, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) lay, sweating and sweating again, and commending himself with all his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) heart to God to deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) present peril.
<p/>Some stumbled over him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), others fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), and one there was who took up a position on top of him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) for some time, and from thence as if from a watchtower issued orders to the troops, shouting out, <div class="bookquote">``Here, our side!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the troops</b></font>)</div>How am I to march, unlucky being that I am? Here the enemy is thickest! Hold the breach there! Shut that gate!
<p/>Barricade those ladders! Here with your stink-pots of pitch and resin, and kettles of boiling oil! Block the streets with feather beds!
<p/>In short, in his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) ardour he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) mentioned every little thing, and every implement and engine of war by means of which an assault upon a city is warded off, while the bruised and battered Sancho, who heard and suffered all, was saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``O if it would only please the Lord to let the island be lost at once, and I could see myself either dead or out of this torture!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Heaven heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) prayer, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) least expected it he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heard voices exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Victory, victory! The enemy retreats beaten!
<p/>Come, senor governor, get up, and come and enjoy the victory, and divide the spoils that have been won from the foe by the might of that invincible arm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They helped him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) to rise, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) feet said, ``The enemy I have beaten you may nail to my forehead; I don't want to divide the spoils of the foe, I only beg and entreat some friend, if I have one, to give me a sup of wine, for I'm parched with thirst, and wipe me dry, for I'm turning to water.
<p/>They rubbed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) down, fetched him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wine and unbound the shields, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seated himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bed, and with fear, agitation, and fatigue he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fainted away.
<p/>Those who had been concerned in the joke were now sorry they had pushed it so far; however, the anxiety his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fainting away had caused them was relieved by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) returning to himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lift me up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said the wretched Sancho in a woebegone voice. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) asked what o'clock it was; they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) it was just daybreak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said no more, and in silence began to dress himself, while all watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), waiting to see what the haste with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) clothes meant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) got himself dressed at last, and then, slowly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was sorely bruised and could not go fast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) proceeded to the stable, followed by all who were present, and going up to Dapple embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a loving kiss on the forehead, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), not without tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``Come along, comrade and friend and partner of my toils and sorrows; when I was with you and had no cares to trouble me except mending your harness and feeding your little carcass, happy were my hours, my days, and my years; but since I left you, and mounted the towers of ambition and pride, a thousand miseries, a thousand troubles, and four thousand anxieties have entered into my soul;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was speaking in this strain he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was fixing the pack-saddle on the ass, without a word from anyone.
<p/>Then having Dapple saddled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), with great pain and difficulty, got up on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and addressing himself to the majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, and Pedro Recio the doctor and several others who stood by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Make way, gentlemen, and let me go back to my old freedom; let me go look for my past life, and raise myself up from this present death.
<p/>I was not born to be a governor or protect islands or cities from the enemies that choose to attack them.
<p/>Saint Peter is very well at Rome; I mean each of us is best following the trade he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was born to.
<p/>A reaping-hook fits my hand better than a governor's sceptre; I'd rather have my fill of gazpacho than be subject to the misery of a meddling doctor who kills me with hunger, and I'd rather lie in summer under the shade of an oak, and in winter wrap myself in a double sheepskin jacket in freedom, than go to bed between holland sheets and dress in sables under the restraint of a government.
<p/>Ploughing and digging, vinedressing and pruning, are more in my way than defending provinces or kingdoms. God be with your worships, and tell my lord the duke that `naked I was born, naked
<p/>I mean that without a farthing I came into this government, and without a farthing I go out of it, very different from the way governors commonly leave other islands.
<p/>for I believe every one of my ribs is crushed, thanks to the enemies that have been trampling over me to-night.
<p/>I find myself, I neither lose nor gain;' Stand aside and let me go; I have to plaster myself, ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>That is unnecessary, senor governor,'' said Doctor Recio, <div class="bookquote">``for I will give your worship a draught against falls and bruises that will soon make you as sound and strong as ever; and as for your diet I promise your worship to behave better, and let you eat plentifully of whatever you like.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pedro Recio/Recio</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You spoke late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' I'd as soon turn Turk as stay any longer. Those jokes won't pass a second time.
<p/>By God I'd as soon remain in this government, or take another, even if it was offered me between two plates, as fly to heaven without wings.
<p/>I am of the breed of the Panzas, and they are every one of them obstinate, and if they once say `odds,' odds it must be, no matter if it is evens, in spite of all the world.
<p/>Here in this stable I leave the ant's wings that lifted me up into the air for the swifts and other birds to eat me, and let's take to level ground and our feet once more; and if they're not shod in pinked shoes of cordovan, they won't want for rough sandals of hemp; `every ewe to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) like,' `and let no one stretch his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) leg beyond the length of the sheet;' and now let me pass, for it's growing late with me.
<p/>To this the majordomo said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor governor, we would let your worship go with all our hearts, though it sorely grieves us to lose you, for your wit and Christian conduct naturally make us regret you; but it is well known that every governor, before he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) leaves the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) has been governing, is bound first of all to render an account.
<p/>Let your worship do so for the ten days you have held the government, and then you may go and the peace of God go with you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' '' No one can demand it of me,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) whom my lord the duke shall appoint
<p/>; I am going to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) I will render an exact one; besides, when I go forth naked as I do, there is no other proof needed to show that I have governed like an angel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By God the great Sancho is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div>said Doctor Recio, ``and we should let him (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) go, for the duke will be beyond measure glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>).
<p/>They all agreed to this, and allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) to go, first offering to bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) company and furnish him (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) with all he (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) wanted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Recio</b></font>) own comfort or for the journey.
<p/>Sancho said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not want anything more than a little barley for Dapple, and half a cheese and half a loaf for himself; for the distance being so short there was no occasion for any better or bulkier provant.
<p/>They all embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with tears embraced all of them, and left them filled with admiration not only at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) remarks but at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) firm and sensible resolution.
<p/>The duke and duchess resolved that the challenge Don Quixote had, for the reason already mentioned, given their vassal, should be proceeded with; and as the young man was in Flanders, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fled to escape having Dona Rodriguez for a mother-in-law, they arranged to substitute for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a Gascon lacquey, named Tosilos, first of all carefully instructing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gascon</b></font>) in all he (<font color='blue'><b>Gascon</b></font>) had to do.
<p/>Two days later the duke told Don Quixote that in four days from that time his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) opponent would present himself on the field of battle armed as a knight, and would maintain that the damsel lied by half a beard, nay a whole beard, if she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) affirmed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) a promise of marriage.
<p/>Don Quixote was greatly pleased at the news, and promised himself to do wonders in the lists, and reckoned it rare good fortune that an opportunity should have offered for letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) noble hosts see what the might of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) strong arm was capable of; and so in high spirits and satisfaction he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) awaited the expiration of the four days, which measured by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) impatience seemed spinning themselves out into four hundred ages.
<p/>Let us leave them to pass as we do other things, and go and bear Sancho company, as mounted on Dapple, half glad, half sad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) paced along on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) road to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, in whose society he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was happier than in being governor of all the islands in the world.
<p/>Well then, it so happened that before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had gone a great way from the island of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) government -LRB-and whether it was island, city, town, or village that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) governed he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) never troubled himself to inquire-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw coming along the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was travelling six pilgrims with staves, foreigners of that sort that beg for alms singing; who as they drew near arranged themselves in a line and lifting up their voices all together began to sing in their own language something that Sancho could not understand, with the exception of one word which sounded plainly <div class="bookquote">``alms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gathered that it was alms they asked for in their song; and
<p/>being, as Cide Hamete says, remarkably charitable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) took out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alforjas the half loaf and half cheese he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had been provided with, and gave them to them, explaining to them by signs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had nothing else to give them.
<p/>'' CHAPTER LIV. WHICH DEALS WITH MATTERS RELATING TO THIS HISTORY AND NO OTHER They received them very gladly, but exclaimed, ``Geld!
<p/>On this one of them took a purse out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bosom and showed it to Sancho, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) comprehended they were asking for money, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) thumb to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) throat and spreading his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand upwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gave them to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had not the sign of a coin about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and urging Dapple forward he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) broke through them.
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was passing, one of them who had been examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) very closely rushed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) exclaimed in a loud voice and good Spanish, <div class="bookquote">``God bless me!

What's this I see? Is it possible that I hold in my arms my dear friend, my good neighbour Sancho Panza?
<p/>Sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) name and find himself embraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) steadily without speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was still unable to recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but the pilgrim perceiving his (<font color='blue'><b>pilgrim</b></font>) perplexity cried, <div class="bookquote">``What!
<p/>But there's no doubt about it, for I'm not asleep, nor am I drunk just now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the pilgrim</b></font>)</div>and is it possible, Sancho Panza, that thou dost not know
<p/>Sancho upon this looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) more carefully began to recall his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) features, and at last recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) perfectly, and without getting off the ass threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) neck saying, <div class="bookquote">``Who the devil could have known thee,

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>If thou dost not betray me, Sancho,'' said the pilgrim, ``I am safe; for in this dress no one will recognise me; but let us turn aside out of the road into that grove there where my comrades are going to eat and rest, and thou shalt eat with them there, for they are very good fellows; I'll have time enough to tell thee then all that has happened me since I left our village in obedience to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Majesty's edict that threatened such severities against the unfortunate people of my nation, as thou hast heard.
<p/>Sancho complied, and Ricote having spoken to the other pilgrims they withdrew to the grove they saw, turning a considerable distance out of the road.
<p/>They threw down their staves, took off their pilgrim's cloaks and remained in their under-clothing; they were all good-looking young fellows, except Ricote, who was a man somewhat advanced in years.
<p/>They carried alforjas all of them, and all apparently well filled, at least with things provocative of thirst, such as would summon it from two leagues off.
<p/>They stretched themselves on the ground, and making a tablecloth of the grass they spread upon it bread, salt, knives, walnut, scraps of cheese, and well-picked ham-bones which if they were past gnawing were not past sucking.
<p/>They also put down a black dainty called, they say, caviar, and made of the eggs of fish, a great thirst-wakener.
<p/>Nor was there any lack of olives, dry, it is true, and without any seasoning, but for all that toothsome and pleasant.
<p/>But what made the best show in the field of the banquet was half a dozen botas of wine, for each of them produced his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own from his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) alforjas; even the good Ricote, who from a Morisco had transformed himself into a German or Dutchman, took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchman</b></font>), which in size might have vied with the five others.
<p/>They then began to eat with very great relish and very leisurely, making the most of each morsel--very small ones of everything--they took up on the point of the knife; and then all at the same moment raised their arms and botas aloft, the mouths placed in their mouths, and all eyes fixed on heaven just as if they were taking aim at it; and in this attitude they remained ever so long, wagging their heads from side to side as if in acknowledgment of the pleasure they were enjoying while they decanted the bowels of the bottles into their own stomachs.
<p/>Sancho beheld all, <div class="bookquote">``and nothing gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pain;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>so far from that, acting on the proverb he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew so well, <div class="bookquote">``when thou art at Rome do as thou seest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) asked Ricote for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) bota and took aim like the rest of them, and with not less enjoyment.
<p/>Four times did the botas bear being uplifted, but the fifth it was all in vain, for they were drier and more sapless than a rush by that time, which made the jollity that had been kept up so far begin to flag.
<p/>Every now and then some one of them would grasp Sancho's right hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own saying, <div class="bookquote">``Espanoli y Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compano;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and Sancho would answer, <div class="bookquote">``Bon compano, jur a Di!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and then go off into a fit of laughter that lasted an hour, without a thought for the moment of anything that had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) government; for cares have very little sway over us while we are eating and drinking.
<p/>At length, the wine having come to an end with them, drowsiness began to come over them, and they dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth.
<p/>Ricote and Sancho alone remained awake, for they had eaten more and drunk less, and Ricote drawing Sancho aside, they seated themselves at the foot of a beech, leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; and without once falling into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own Morisco tongue Ricote spoke as follows in pure Castilian:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou knowest well, neighbour and friend Sancho Panza, how the proclamation or edict his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) Majesty commanded to be issued against those of my nation filled us all with terror and dismay; me at least it did, insomuch that I think before the time granted us for quitting Spain was out, the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon me and upon my children.
<p/>I decided, then, and I think wisely -LRB-just like one who knows that at a certain date the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) lives in will be taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), and looks out beforehand for another to change into-RRB-, I decided, I say, to leave the town myself, alone and without my family, and go to seek out some place to remove them to comfortably and not in the hurried way in which the others took their departure; for I saw very plainly, and so did all the older men among us, that the proclamations were not mere threats, as some said, but positive enactments which would be enforced at the appointed time; and what made me believe this was what I knew of the base and extravagant designs which our people harboured, designs of such a nature that I think it was a divine inspiration that moved his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) Majesty to carry out a resolution so spirited; not that we were all guilty, for some there were true and steadfast Christians; but they were so few that they could make no head against those who were not; and it was not prudent to cherish a viper in the bosom by having enemies in the house.
<p/>In short it was with just cause that we were visited with the penalty of banishment, a mild and lenient one in the eyes of some, but to us the most terrible that could be inflicted upon us.
<p/>thy neighbour Ricote, the Morisco shopkeeper of thy village?''  (<font color='red'><b>Castilian</b></font>)</div>Ricote, in this mummer's dress thou art in? '' '' Wherever we are we weep for Spain; for after all we were born there and it is our natural fatherland.
<p/>Nowhere do we find the reception our unhappy condition needs; and in Barbary and all the parts of Africa where we counted upon being received, succoured, and welcomed, it is there they insult and ill-treat us most.
<p/>We knew not our good fortune until we lost it; and such is the longing we almost all of us have to return to Spain, that most of those who like myself know the language, and there are many who do, come back to it and leave their wives and children
<p/>forsaken yonder, so great is their love for it; and now I know by experience the meaning of the saying, sweet is the love of one's country.
<p/>'' I left our village, as I said, and went to France, but though they gave us a kind reception there
<p/>I crossed into Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed to me we might live with more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay any attention to trifling points; everyone lives as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) likes, for in most parts they enjoy liberty of conscience.
<p/>I took a house in a town near Augsburg, and then joined these pilgrims, who are in the habit of coming to Spain in great numbers every year to visit the shrines there, which they look upon as their Indies and a sure and certain source of gain.
<p/>They travel nearly all over it, and there is no town out of which they do not go full up of meat and drink, as the saying is, and with a real, at least, in money, and they come off at the end of their travels with more than a hundred crowns saved, which, changed into gold, they smuggle out of the kingdom either in the hollow of their staves or in the patches of their pilgrim's cloaks or by some device of their own, and carry to their own country in spite of the guards at the posts and passes where they are searched.
<p/>Now my purpose is, Sancho, to carry away the treasure that I left buried, which, as it is outside the town, I shall be able to do without risk, and
<p/>to write, or cross over from Valencia, to my daughter and wife, who I know are at Algiers, and find some means of bringing them to some French port and thence to Germany, there to await what it may be God's will to do with us; for, after all, Sancho, I know well that Ricota my daughter and
<p/>Francisca Ricota my wife are Catholic Christians, and though I am not so much so, still I am more of a Christian than a Moor, and it is always my prayer to God that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will open the eyes of my understanding and show me how I am to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); but what amazes me and I cannot understand is why my wife and daughter should have gone to Barbary rather than to France, where they could live as Christians.
<p/>To this Sancho replied, <div class="bookquote">``Remember, Ricote, that may not have been open to them, for Juan Tiopieyo thy wife's brother took them, and being a true Moor
<p/>I was anxious to see all I could. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) went where he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) could go most easily; and another thing I can tell thee
<p/>, it is my belief thou art going in vain to look for what thou hast left buried, for we heard they took from thy brother-in-law and thy wife a great quantity of pearls and money in gold which they brought to be passed.''
<p/>``but I know they did not touch my hoard, for I did not tell them where it was, for fear of accidents; and so, if thou wilt come with me, Sancho, and help me to take it away and conceal it, I will give thee two hundred crowns wherewith thou mayest relieve thy necessities, and, as thou knowest
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``but I am not at all covetous, for I gave up an office this morning in which, if I was, I might have made the walls of my house of gold and dined off silver plates before six months were over; and so for this reason, and
<p/>because I feel I would be guilty of treason to my king if I helped his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) enemies, I would not go with thee if instead of promising me two hundred crowns thou wert to give me four hundred here in hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That may be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div>said Ricote; , I know they are many.'' '' And what office is this thou hast given up, Sancho?'' asked Ricote.
<p/>I have given up being governor of an island,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and such a one, faith, as you won't find the like of easily.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' And where is this island?'' said Ricote. '' Where?'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``two leagues from here, and it is called the island of Barataria.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div>said Ricote; <div class="bookquote">``islands are away out in the sea; there are no islands on the mainland. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I tell thee, friend Ricote, I left it this morning, and yesterday I was governing there as I pleased like a sagittarius; but for all that I gave it up, for it seemed to me a dangerous office, a governor's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>I have gained,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``the knowledge that I am no good for governing, unless it is a drove of cattle, and that the riches that are to be got by these governments are got at the cost of one's rest and sleep, ay and even one's food; for in islands the governors must eat little, especially if they have doctors to look after their health.
<p/>No islands! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>And what hast thou gained by the government?'' asked Ricote. '' '' '' I don't understand thee, Sancho,'' said Ricote; <div class="bookquote">``but it seems to me all nonsense thou art talking.
<p/>Who would give thee islands to govern? Is there any scarcity in the world of cleverer men than thou art for governors?
<p/>Hold thy peace, Sancho, and come back to thy senses, and consider whether thou wilt come with me as I said to help me to take away treasure I left
<p/>buried -LRB-for indeed it may be called a treasure, it is so large-RRB-, and I will give thee wherewithal to keep thee, as I told thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div><p/>And I have told thee already, Ricote, that I will not,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``let it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrayed, and go thy way in God's name and let me go mine; for I know that well-gotten gain may be lost, but ill-gotten gain is lost, itself and its owner likewise.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I will not press thee, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div>said Ricote; <div class="bookquote">``but tell me, wert thou in our village when my wife and daughter and brother-in-law left it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and I can tell thee thy daughter left it looking so lovely that all the village turned out to see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and everybody said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was the fairest creature in the world.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wept as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) went, and embraced all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) friends and acquaintances and those who came out to see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) begged them all to commend her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to God and Our Lady his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) mother, and this in such a touching way that it made me weep myself, though I'm not much given to tears commonly; and, faith, many a one would have liked to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), or go out and carry her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) off on the road;
<p/>The one who showed himself most moved was Don Pedro Gregorio, the rich young heir thou knowest of, and they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) was deep in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and since she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) has not been seen in our village again, and we all suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) has gone after her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to steal her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) away, but so far nothing has been heard of it.
<p/>but the fear of going against the king's command kept them back. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I always had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for my daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div>said Ricote;
<p/>; for thou must have heard it said, Sancho, that the Morisco women seldom or never engage in amours with the old Christians; and my daughter, who I fancy thought more of being a Christian than of lovemaking, would not trouble herself about the attentions of this heir.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God grant it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``for it would be a bad business for both of them; but now let me be off, friend Ricote, for I want to reach where my master Don Quixote is to-night.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but as I felt sure of my Ricota's virtue it gave me no uneasiness to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God be with thee, brother Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div>said Ricote; <div class="bookquote">``my comrades are beginning to stir, and it is time, too, for us to continue our journey;''  (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div>and then they both embraced, and Sancho mounted Dapple, and Ricote leant upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) staff, and so they parted.
<p/>The length of time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) delayed with Ricote prevented Sancho from reaching the duke's castle that day, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was within half a league of it when night, somewhat dark and cloudy, overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).
<p/>This, however, as it was summer time, did not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) much uneasiness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) turned aside out of the road intending to wait for morning; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ill luck and hard fate so willed it that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was searching about for a place to make himself as comfortable as possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and Dapple fell into a deep dark hole that lay among some very old buildings.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fell he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) commended himself with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart to God, fancying he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was not going to stop until he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reached the depths of the bottomless pit; but it did not turn out so, for at little more than thrice a man's height
<p/>CHAPTER LV. OF WHAT BEFELL SANCHO ON THE ROAD, AND OTHER THINGS THAT CANNOT BE SURPASSED Dapple touched bottom, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found himself sitting on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without having received any hurt or damage whatever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt himself all over and held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath to try whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite sound or had a hole made in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anywhere, and finding himself all right and whole and in perfect health he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was profuse in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thanks to God our Lord for the mercy that had been shown him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been broken into a thousand pieces.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also felt along the sides of the pit with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands to see if it were possible to get out of it without help, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found they were quite smooth and afforded no hold anywhere, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was greatly distressed, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard how pathetically and dolefully Dapple was bemoaning himself, and
<p/>no wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) complained, nor was it from ill-temper, for in truth he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in a very good case. ''
<p/>Who would have said that one who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne, governor of an island, giving orders to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) servants and his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) vassals, would see himself to-day buried in a pit without a soul to help him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), or servant or vassal to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) relief?
<p/>Here must we perish with hunger, my ass and myself, if indeed we don't die first, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) bruises and injuries, and I of grief and sorrow.
<p/>At any rate I'll not be as lucky as my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went down into the cave of that enchanted Montesinos, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) found people to make more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) own house; for it seems he (<font color='blue'><b>Montesinos</b></font>) came in for a table laid out and a bed ready made.
<p/>Alas,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``what unexpected accidents happen at every step to those who live in this miserable world! There he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw fair and pleasant visions, but here I'll see, I imagine, toads and adders.
<p/>They'll take up my bones out of this, when it is heaven's will that I'm found, picked clean, white and polished, and my good Dapple's with them, and by that, perhaps, it will be found out who we are, at least by such as have heard that Sancho Panza never separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ass, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ass from Sancho Panza.
<p/>, I say again, that our hard fate should not let us die in our own country and among our own people, where if there was no help for our misfortune, at any rate there would be some one to grieve for it and to close our eyes as we passed away!
<p/>Unlucky wretch that I am, what an end my follies and fancies have come to! Unlucky wretches O comrade and friend, how ill have I repaid thy faithful services!
<p/>we are both in; and I promise to put a crown of laurel on thy head, and make thee look like a poet laureate, and give thee double feeds.
<p/>In this strain did Sancho bewail himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ass listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), but answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) never a word, such was the distress and anguish the poor beast
<p/>Forgive me, and entreat Fortune, as well as thou canst, to deliver us out of this miserable strait ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>found himself in.
<p/>At length, after a night spent in bitter moanings and lamentations, day came, and by its light Sancho perceived that it was wholly impossible to escape out of that pit without help, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fell to bemoaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fate and uttering loud shouts to find out if there was anyone within hearing; but all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shouting was only crying in the wilderness, for there was not a soul anywhere in the neighbourhood to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and then at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gave himself up for dead.
<p/>Dapple was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) back, and Sancho helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) feet, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was scarcely able to keep; and then taking a piece of bread out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alforjas which had shared their fortunes in the fall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gave it to the ass, to whom it was not unwelcome, saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>),
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough to admit a person if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stooped and squeezed himself into a small compass.
<p/>Sancho made for it, and entered it by creeping, and found it wide and spacious on the inside, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was able to see as a ray of sunlight that penetrated what might be called the roof showed it all plainly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) observed too that it opened and widened out into another spacious cavity; seeing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) way back to where the ass was, and with a stone began to pick away the clay from the hole until in a short time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had made room for the beast to pass easily, and this accomplished, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) by the halter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) proceeded to traverse the cavern to see if there was any outlet at the other end.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) advanced, sometimes in the dark, sometimes without light, but never without fear; <div class="bookquote">``God Almighty help me!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) to himself; <div class="bookquote">``this that is a misadventure to me would make a good adventure for my master Don Quixote.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have been sure to take these depths and dungeons for flowery gardens or the palaces of Galiana, and would have counted upon issuing out of this darkness and imprisonment into some blooming meadow; but I, unlucky that I am, hopeless and spiritless, expect at every step another pit deeper than the first to open under my feet and swallow me up for good; `welcome evil, if thou comest alone.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In this way and with these reflections he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seemed to himself to have travelled rather more than half a league, when at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) perceived a dim light that looked like daylight and found its way in on one side, showing that this road, which appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the road to the other world, led to some opening.
<p/>Here Cide Hamete leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and returns to Don Quixote, who in high spirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for the battle he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was to fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who had robbed Dona Rodriguez's daughter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) honour, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hoped to obtain satisfaction for the wrong and injury shamefully done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>).
<p/>It came to pass, then, that having sallied forth one morning to practise and exercise himself in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have to do in the encounter he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) expected to find himself engaged in the next day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was putting Rocinante through his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) paces or pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to the charge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet so close to a pit that
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With bread all sorrows are less. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but for reining him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in tightly it would have been impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to avoid falling into it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) up, however, without a fall, and coming a little closer examined the hole without dismounting; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was looking at it he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard loud cries proceeding from it, and by listening attentively was able to make out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who uttered them was saying, ``Ho, above there!
<p/>is there any Christian that hears me, or any charitable gentleman that will take pity on a sinner buried alive, on an unfortunate disgoverned governor?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) heard, whereat he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) was taken aback and amazed, and raising his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) own voice as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) cried out, ``Who is below there?

<p/>When Don Quixote heard this his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) amazement was redoubled and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) perturbation grew greater than ever, for it suggested itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mind that Sancho must be dead, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) soul was in torment down there; and carried away by this idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I conjure thee by everything that as a Catholic Christian I can conjure thee by, tell me who thou art; and if thou art a soul in torment, tell me what thou wouldst have me do for thee; for as my profession is to give aid and succour to those that need it in this world, it will also extend to aiding and succouring the distressed of the other, who cannot help themselves.''

<p/>Nor was this all; one would have fancied the ass understood what Sancho said, because that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) began to bray so loudly that the whole cave rang again.

<p/>Don Quixote left him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and hastened to the castle to tell the duke and duchess what had happened Sancho, and they were not a little astonished at it
<p/>; they could easily understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) having fallen, from the confirmatory circumstance of the cave which had been in existence there from time immemorial; but they could not imagine how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had quitted the government without their receiving any intimation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) coming.
<p/>To be brief, they fetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint of many hands and much labour they drew up Dapple and Sancho Panza out of the darkness into the light of day.
<p/>A student who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) remarked, ``That's the way all bad governors should come out of their governments, as this sinner comes out of the depths of the pit, dead with hunger, pale, and I suppose without a farthing.
<p/>Sancho overheard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and said, ``It is eight or ten days, brother growler, since I entered upon the government of the island they gave me, and all that time I never had a bellyful of victuals, no not for an hour; doctors persecuted me and enemies crushed my bones; nor had I any opportunity of taking bribes or levying taxes; and if that be the case, as it is, I don't deserve, I think, to come out in this fashion; but `man proposes and God disposes;' and God knows what is best, and what suits each one best; and `as the occasion, so the behaviour;' and `let nobody say <div class="bookquote">``I won't drink of this water;'' (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>' and `where one thinks there are flitches, there are no pegs;' God knows my meaning and that's enough; I say no more, though I could.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``or there will never be an end of it; keep a safe conscience and let them say what they like; for trying to stop slanderers' tongues is like trying to put gates to the open plain.
<p/>If a governor comes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) government rich, they say he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) has been a thief; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) comes out poor, that he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) has been a noodle and a blockhead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Famous testimony! '' '' '' They'll be pretty sure this time,'' said Sancho, ``to set me down for a fool rather than a thief.
<p/>Thus talking, and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people, they reached the castle, where in one of the corridors the duke and duchess stood waiting for them; but Sancho would not go up to see the duke until he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had first put up Dapple in the stable, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had passed a very bad night in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) last quarters
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it was your highnesses' pleasure, not because of any desert of my own, I went to govern your island of Barataria, which 'I entered naked, and naked I find myself
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went upstairs to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lord and lady, and kneeling before them he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, ; I neither lose nor gain.'
<p/>I have answered questions, I have decided causes, and always dying of hunger, for Doctor Pedro Recio of Tirteafuera, the island and governor doctor, would have it so.
<p/>Enemies attacked us by night and put us in a great quandary, but the people of the island say they came off safe and victorious by the might of my arm; and may God give them as much health as there's truth in what they say.
<p/>In short, during that time I have weighed the cares and responsibilities governing brings with it, and by my reckoning I find my shoulders can't bear them, nor are they a load for my loins or arrows for my quiver; and so, before the government threw me over I preferred to throw the government over; and yesterday morning I left the island as I found it, with the same streets, houses, and roofs it had when I entered it.
<p/>I asked no loan of anybody, nor did I try to fill my pocket; and though I meant to make some useful laws, I made hardly any, as I was afraid they would not be kept; for in that case it comes to the same thing to make them or not to make them.
<p/>I quitted the island, as I said, without any escort except my ass; I fell into a pit, I pushed on through it, until this morning by the light of the sun
<p/>I saw an outlet, but not so easy a one but that, had not heaven sent me my master Don Quixote, I'd have stayed there till the end of the world.
<p/>So now my lord and lady duke and duchess, here is your governor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) has held the government has come by the knowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) would not give anything to be governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world; and that point being settled, kissing your worships' feet, and imitating the game of the boys when they say, `leap thou, and give me one,' I take a leap out of the government and pass into the service of my master Don Quixote; for after all, though in it I eat my bread in fear and trembling, at any rate I take my fill; and for my part, so long as I'm full, it's all alike to me whether it's with carrots or with partridges.
<p/>Here Sancho brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) long speech to an end, Don Quixote having been the whole time in dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) uttering a host of absurdities; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) leave off with so few, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thanked heaven in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart.
<p/>The duke embraced Sancho and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was heartily sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had given up the government so soon, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was provided with some other post on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) estate less onerous and more profitable.
<p/>The duchess also embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and gave orders that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) should be taken good care of, as it was plain to see he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had been badly treated and worse bruised.
<p/>Whether I have governed well or ill, I have had witnesses who will say what they think fit. '' CHAPTER LVI.
<p/>OF THE PRODIGIOUS AND UNPARALLELED BATTLE THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THE LACQUEY TOSILOS IN DEFENCE OF THE DAUGHTER OF
<p/>The duke and duchess had no reason to regret the joke that had been played upon Sancho Panza in giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) the government; especially as their majordomo returned the same day, and gave them a minute account of almost every word and deed that Sancho uttered or did during the time; and to wind up with, eloquently described to them the attack upon the island and Sancho's fright and departure, with which they were not a little amused.
<p/>After this the history goes on to say that the day fixed for the battle arrived, and that the duke, after having repeatedly instructed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lacquey Tosilos how to deal with Don Quixote so as to vanquish him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) without killing or wounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), gave orders to have the heads removed from the lances, telling Don Quixote that Christian charity, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) plumed himself, could not suffer the battle to be fought with so much risk and danger to life; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must be content with the offer of a battlefield on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) territory -LRB-though that was against the decree of the holy Council, which prohibits all challenges of the sort-RRB- and not push such an arduous venture to its extreme limits.
<p/>Don Quixote bade his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) excellence arrange all matters connected with the affair as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pleased, as on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) part he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in everything.
<p/>The dread day, then, having arrived, and the duke having ordered a spacious stand to be erected facing the court of the castle for the judges of the field and the appellant duennas, mother and daughter, vast crowds flocked from all the villages and hamlets of the neighbourhood to see the novel spectacle of the battle; nobody, dead or alive, in those parts having ever seen or heard of such a one.
<p/>The first person to enter the field and the lists was the master of the ceremonies, who surveyed and paced the whole ground to see that there was nothing unfair and nothing concealed to make the combatants stumble or fall; then the duennas entered and seated themselves, enveloped in mantles covering their eyes, nay even their bosoms, and displaying no slight emotion as Don Quixote appeared in the lists.
<p/>Shortly afterwards, accompanied by several trumpets and mounted on a powerful steed that threatened to crush the whole place, the great lacquey Tosilos made his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) appearance on one side of the courtyard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) visor down and stiffly cased in a suit of stout shining armour.
<p/>The horse was a manifest Frieslander, broad-backed and flea-bitten, and with half a hundred of wool hanging to each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fetlocks.
<p/>The gallant combatant came well primed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master the duke as to how he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was to bear himself against the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; being warned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) must on no account slay him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), but strive to shirk the first encounter so as to avoid the risk of killing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was sure to do if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) full tilt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) crossed the courtyard at a walk, and coming to where the duennas were placed stopped to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who demanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for a husband; the marshal of the field summoned Don Quixote, who had already presented himself in the courtyard, and standing by the side of Tosilos he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) addressed the duennas, and asked them if they consented that Don Quixote of La Mancha should do battle for their right.
<p/>DONA RODRIGUEZ They said they did, and that whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should do in that behalf they declared rightly done, final and valid.
<p/>By this time the duke and duchess had taken their places in a gallery commanding the enclosure, which was filled to overflowing with a multitude of people eager to see this perilous and unparalleled encounter.
<p/>The conditions of the combat were that if Don Quixote proved the victor his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) antagonist was to marry the daughter of Dona Rodriguez; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should be vanquished his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) opponent was released from the promise that was claimed against him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and from all obligations to give satisfaction.
<p/>The master of the ceremonies apportioned the sun to them, and stationed them, each on the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was to stand.
<p/>The drums beat, the sound of the trumpets filled the air, the earth trembled under foot, the hearts of the gazing crowd were full of anxiety, some hoping for a happy issue, some apprehensive of an untoward ending to the affair, and lastly, Don Quixote, commending himself with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart to God our Lord and to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, stood waiting for them to give the necessary signal for the onset.
<p/>It seems that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) stood contemplating his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enemy she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as the most beautiful woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had ever seen all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) life; and the little blind boy whom in our streets they commonly call Love had no mind to let slip the chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart, and adding it to the list of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) trophies; and so, stealing gently upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) unseen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) drove a dart two yards long into the poor lacquey's left side and pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart through and through; which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was able to do quite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ease, for Love is invisible, and comes in and goes out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) likes, without anyone calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to account for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) does.
<p/>Well then, when they gave the signal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy, musing upon the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had already made mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) liberty, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) paid no attention to the sound of the trumpet, unlike Don Quixote, who was off the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard it, and, at the highest speed Rocinante was capable of, set out to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enemy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) good squire Sancho shouting lustily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) start, <div class="bookquote">``God guide thee, cream and flower of knights-errant!
<p/>Our lacquey, however, was thinking of something very different; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) only thought of what I am now going to mention. God give thee the victory, for thou hast the right on thy side!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But though Tosilos saw Don Quixote coming at him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) never stirred a step from the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was posted; and instead of doing so called loudly to the marshal of the field, to whom when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) came up to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wanted he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, is not this battle to decide whether I marry or do not marry that lady?
<p/>Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the lacquey, <div class="bookquote">``I feel qualms of conscience, and I should lay a-heavy burden upon it if I were to proceed any further with the combat; I therefore declare that I yield myself vanquished, and that I am willing to marry the lady at once.
<p/>The marshal of the field was lost in astonishment at the words of Tosilos; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) was one of those who were privy to the arrangement of the affair he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) knew not what to say in reply.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>was the answer. '' '' Don Quixote pulled up in mid career when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enemy was not coming on to the attack.
<p/>The duke could not make out the reason why the battle did not go on; but the marshal of the field hastened to him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) to let him (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) know what Tosilos said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>marshal</b></font>) was amazed and extremely angry at it.
<p/>In the meantime Tosilos advanced to where Dona Rodriguez sat and said in a loud voice, ``Senora, I am willing to marry your daughter, and I have no wish to obtain by strife and fighting what I can obtain in peace and without any risk to my life.
<p/>The valiant Don Quixote heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and said, ``As that is the case I am released and absolved from my promise; let them marry by all means, and as `God our Lord has given her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), may Saint Peter add his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) blessing.'
<p/>The duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle, and going up to Tosilos he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Is it true, sir knight, that you yield yourself vanquished, and that moved by scruples of conscience you wish to marry this damsel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) does well,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for what thou hast to give to the mouse, give to the cat, and it will save thee all trouble.
<p/>Tosilos meanwhile was trying to unlace his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) helmet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) begged them to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) help at once, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) power of breathing was failing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not remain so long shut up in that confined space.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``It is, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tosilos</b></font>)</div>replied Tosilos. '' '' They removed it in all haste, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lacquey features were revealed to public gaze.
<p/>At this sight Dona Rodriguez and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) daughter raised a mighty outcry, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``This is a trick! This is a trick!
<p/>They have put Tosilos, my lord the duke's lacquey, upon us in place of the real husband. The justice of God and the king against such trickery, not to say roguery!''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not distress yourselves, ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``for this is no trickery or roguery; or if it is, it is not the duke who is at the bottom of it, but those wicked enchanters who persecute me, and who, jealous of my reaping the glory of this victory, have turned your husband's features into those of this person, who you say is a lacquey of the duke's; take my advice, and notwithstanding the malice of my enemies marry him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), for beyond a doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is the one you wish for a husband.
<p/>When the duke heard this all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) anger was near vanishing in a fit of laughter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``The things that happen to Senor Don Quixote are so extraordinary that I am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is not one; but let us adopt this plan and device; let us put off the marriage for, say, a fortnight, and let us keep this person about whom we are uncertain in close confinement, and perhaps in the course of that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) may return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) original shape; for the spite which the enchanters entertain against Senor Don Quixote cannot last so long, especially as it is of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions and transformations.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``those scoundrels are well used to changing whatever concerns my master from one thing into another.
<p/>A knight that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) overcame some time back, called the Knight of the Mirrors, they turned into the shape of the bachelor Samson Carrasco of our town and a great friend of ours; and my lady Dulcinea del Toboso they have turned into a common country wench; so I suspect this lacquey will have to live and die a lacquey all the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life.
<p/>Here the Rodriguez's daughter exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) be who he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may, this man that claims me for a wife; I am thankful to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) for the same, for I had rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress of a gentleman; though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) who played me false is nothing of the kind.
<p/>To be brief, all the talk and all that had happened ended in Tosilos being shut up until it was seen how his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) transformation turned out.
<p/>All hailed Don Quixote as victor, but the greater number were vexed and disappointed at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously waiting for had not battered one another to pieces, just as the boys are disappointed when the man they are waiting to see hanged does not come out, because the prosecution or the court has pardoned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The people dispersed, the duke and Don Quixote returned to the castle, they locked up Tosilos, Dona Rodriguez and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rodriguez</b></font>) daughter remained perfectly contented when they saw that any way the affair must end in marriage, and Tosilos wanted nothing else.

<p/>DAMSELS Don Quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was leading in the castle; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was making himself sorely missed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid the countless luxuries and enjoyments his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hosts lavished upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as a knight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) felt too that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have to render a strict account to heaven of that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked the duke and duchess to grant him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) permission to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) departure.
<p/>The duchess gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wife's letters to Sancho Panza, who shed tears over them, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Who would have thought that such grand hopes as the news of my government bred in my wife Teresa Panza's breast would end in my going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master Don Quixote of La Mancha?
<p/>Still I'm glad to see my Teresa behaved as she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) ought in sending the acorns, for if she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) had not sent them
<p/>THE DUCHESS'S They gave it, showing at the same time that they were very sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was leaving them. I'd have been sorry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>)'d have shown herself ungrateful.
<p/>It is a comfort to me that they can't call that present a bribe; for I had got the government already when she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) sent them, and it's but reasonable that those who have had a good turn done
<p/>After all I went into the government naked, and I come out of it naked; so I can say with a safe conscience--and that's no small matter--`naked
<p/>them should show their gratitude, if it's only with a trifle. I was born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain.'
<p/>Thus did Sancho soliloquise on the day of their departure, as Don Quixote, who had the night before taken leave of the duke and duchess, coming out made his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) appearance at an early hour in full armour in the courtyard of the castle.
<p/>The whole household of the castle were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) from the corridors, and the duke and duchess, too, came out to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Sancho was mounted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Dapple, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alforjas, valise, and proven, supremely happy because the duke's majordomo, the same that had acted the part of the Trifaldi, had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a little purse with two hundred gold crowns to meet the necessary expenses of the road, but of this Don Quixote knew nothing as yet.
<p/>While all were, as has been said, observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), suddenly from among the duennas and handmaidens the impudent and witty Altisidora lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) voice and said in pathetic tones: Give ear, cruel knight;
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Draw rein; where's the need Of spurring the flanks Of that ill-broken steed? From what art thou flying? No dragon I am, Not even a sheep, But a tender young lamb.

<p/>In thy claws, ruthless robber, Thou bearest away The heart of a meek Loving maid for thy prey, Three kerchiefs thou stealest, And garters a pair, From legs than the whitest Of marble more fair;
<p/>Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee! And the sighs that pursue thee Would burn to the ground Two thousand Troy Towns, If so many were found.
<p/>May no bowels of mercy To Sancho be granted, And thy Dulcinea Be left still enchanted, May thy falsehood to me Find its punishment in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>),
<p/>Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee? Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee! For in my land the just Often pays for the sinner.
<p/>May thy grandest adventures Discomfitures prove, May thy joys be all dreams, And forgotten thy love. Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee?
<p/>May thy name be abhorred For thy conduct to ladies, From London to England, From Seville to Cadiz; May thy cards be unlucky, Thy hands contain ne'er a King, seven, or ace
<p/>Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee! When thou playest primera; When thy corns are cut May it be to the quick; When thy grinders are drawn
<p/>May the roots of them stick. Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee? Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!
<p/>Don Quixote stood staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>); and without uttering a word in reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) turned round to Sancho and said, ``Sancho my friend, I conjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth; say, hast thou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters this love-sick maid speaks of?
<p/>To this Sancho made answer, ``The three kerchiefs I have; but the garters, as much as `over the hills of Ubeda.'
<p/>The duchess was amazed at Altisidora's assurance; she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was bold, lively, and impudent, but not so much so as to venture to make free in this fashion; and not being prepared for the joke, her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) astonishment was all the greater.
<p/>The duke had a mind to keep up the sport, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``It does not seem to me well done in you, sir knight, that after having received the hospitality that has been offered you in this very castle, you should have ventured to carry off even three kerchiefs, not to say my handmaid's garters.
<p/>All the while the unhappy Altisidora was bewailing herself in the above strain ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' It shows a bad heart and does not tally with your reputation.
<p/>Restore her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) garters, or else I defy you to mortal combat, for I am not afraid of rascally enchanters changing or altering my features as they changed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) who encountered you into those of my lacquey, Tosilos.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that I should draw my sword against your illustrious person from which I have received such great favours.
<p/>The kerchiefs I will restore, as Sancho says he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) has them; as to the garters that is impossible, for I have not got them, neither has he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); and if your handmaiden here will look in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hiding-places, depend upon it she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) will find them.
<p/>I have never been a thief, my lord duke, nor do I mean to be so long as I live, if God cease not to have me in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) keeping.
<p/>This damsel by her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) own confession speaks as one in love, for which I am not to blame, and therefore need not ask pardon, either of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) or of your excellence, whom I entreat to have a better opinion of me, and once more to give me leave to pursue my journey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>And may God so prosper it, Senor Don Quixote,'' said the duchess, ``that we may always hear good news of your exploits; God speed you; for the longer you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of the damsels who behold you; and as for this one of mine, I will so chastise her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) will not transgress again, either with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) eyes or with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One word and no more, O valiant Don Quixote, I ask you to hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Altisidora</b></font>)</div>said Altisidora, <div class="bookquote">``and that is that I beg your pardon about the theft of the garters; for by God and upon my soul I have got them on, and I have fallen into the same blunder as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did who went looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ass being all the while mounted on it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Altisidora</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Didn't I say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho. '' I'm a likely one to hide thefts! Why if I wanted to deal in them, opportunities came ready enough to me in my government.
<p/>Don Quixote bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head, and saluted the duke and duchess and all the bystanders, and wheeling Rocinante round, Sancho following him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on Dapple, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) rode out of the castle, shaping his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) course for Saragossa.
<p/>'' CHAPTER LVIII. WHICH TELLS HOW ADVENTURES CAME CROWDING ON DON QUIXOTE IN SUCH NUMBERS THAT THEY GAVE ONE ANOTHER NO BREATHING
<p/>-TIME When Don Quixote saw himself in open country, free, and relieved from the attentions of Altisidora, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) felt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ease, and in fresh spirits to take up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to Sancho he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Freedom, Sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heaven has bestowed upon men; no treasures that the earth holds buried or the sea conceals can compare with it; for freedom, as for honour, life may and should be ventured; and on the other hand, captivity is the greatest evil that can fall to the lot of man.
<p/>I say this, Sancho, because thou hast seen the good cheer, the abundance we have enjoyed in this castle we are leaving; well then, amid those dainty banquets and snow-cooled beverages I felt as though I were undergoing the straits of hunger, because I did not enjoy them with the same freedom as if they had been mine own; for the sense of being under an obligation to return benefits and favours received is a restraint that checks the independence of the spirit.
<p/>Happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), to whom heaven has given a piece of bread for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is not bound to give thanks to any but heaven itself!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For all your worship says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``it is not becoming that there should be no thanks on our part for two hundred gold crowns that the duke's majordomo has given me in a little purse which I carry next my heart, like a warming plaster or comforter, to meet any chance calls; for we shan't always find castles where they'll entertain us; now and then we may light upon roadside inns where they'll cudgel us.
<p/>In conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing their journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half a league, they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched upon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner.
<p/>They had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some objects under them, standing upright or lying flat, and arranged at intervals.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Don Quixote approached the diners, and, saluting them courteously first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked them what it was those cloths covered. ''
<p/>Senor,'' answered one of the party, <div class="bookquote">``under these cloths are some images carved in relief intended for a retablo we are putting up in our village; we carry them covered up that they may not be soiled, and on our shoulders that they may not be broken.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With your good leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``I should like to see them; for images that are carried so carefully no doubt must be fine ones.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think they were!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the other; <div class="bookquote">``let the money they cost speak for that; for as a matter of fact there is not one of them that does not stand us in more than fifty ducats; and that your worship may judge; wait a moment, and you shall see with your own eyes;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went and uncovered the first image, which proved to be one of Saint George on horseback with a serpent writhing at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) feet and the lance thrust down its throat with all that fierceness that is usually depicted.
<p/>On seeing it Don Quixote said, ``That knight was one of the best knights-errant the army of heaven ever owned; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was called Don Saint George, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was moreover a defender of maidens.
<p/>The man uncovered it, and it was seen to be that of Saint Martin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) horse, dividing his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) cloak with the beggar.
<p/>The instant Don Quixote saw it he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``This knight too was one of the Christian adventurers, but I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was generous rather than valiant, as thou mayest perceive, Sancho, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) dividing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cloak with the beggar and giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) half of it; no doubt it was winter at the time, for otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the whole of it,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The whole group was one blaze of gold, as the saying is. Let us see this next one. '' so charitable was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not that, most likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) held with the proverb that says, `For giving and keeping there's need of brains.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Don Quixote laughed, and asked them to take off the next cloth, underneath which was seen the image of the patron saint of the Spains seated on horseback, his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) sword stained with blood, trampling on Moors and treading heads underfoot; and on seeing it Don Quixote exclaimed, ``Ay, this is a knight, and of the squadrons of Christ!
<p/>This one is called Don Saint James the Moorslayer, one of the bravest saints and knights the world ever had or heaven has now.
<p/>They then raised another cloth which it appeared covered Saint Paul falling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) horse, with all the details that are usually given in representations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) conversion.
<p/>When Don Quixote saw it, rendered in such lifelike style that one would have said Christ was speaking and Paul answering, <div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said, ``was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) time the greatest enemy that the Church of God our Lord had, and the greatest champion it will ever have; a knight-errant in life, a steadfast saint in death, an untiring labourer in the Lord's vineyard, a teacher of the Gentiles, whose school was heaven, and whose instructor and master was Jesus Christ himself.
<p/>There were no more images, so Don Quixote bade them cover them up again, and said to those who had brought them, <div class="bookquote">``I take it as a happy omen, brothers, to have seen what I have; for these saints and knights were of the same profession as myself, which is the calling of arms; only there is this difference between them and me, that they were saints, and fought with divine weapons, and I am a sinner and fight with human ones.
<p/>They won heaven by force of arms, for heaven suffereth violence; and I, so far, know not what I have won by dint of my sufferings; but if my Dulcinea del Toboso were to be released from hers, perhaps with mended fortunes and a mind restored to itself I might direct my steps in a better path than I am following at present.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>The men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the words of Don Quixote, though they did not understand one half of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) meant by them.
<p/>'' '' '' May God hear and sin be deaf,'' said Sancho to this. They finished their dinner, took their images on their backs, and bidding farewell to Don Quixote resumed their journey.
<p/>Sancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's knowledge, as much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had never known him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), for it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that there was no story or event in the world that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had not at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fingers' ends and fixed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) memory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``In truth, master mine, if this that has happened to us to-day is to be called an adventure, it has been one of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in the whole course of our travels; we have come out of it unbelaboured and undismayed, neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten the earth with our bodies, nor have we been left famishing; blessed be God that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has let me see such a thing with my own eyes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Thou sayest well, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but remember all times are not alike nor do they always run the same way; and these things the vulgar commonly call omens, which are not based upon any natural reason, will by him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happy accidents merely.
<p/>One of these believers in omens will get up of a morning, leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) house, and meet a friar of the order of the blessed Saint Francis, and, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) had met a griffin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) will turn about and go home.
<p/>With another Mendoza the salt is spilt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mendoza</b></font>) table, and gloom is spilt over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mendoza</b></font>) heart, as if nature was obliged to give warning of coming misfortunes by means of such trivial things as these.
<p/>Scipio on coming to Africa stumbled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Scipio</b></font>) leaped on shore; his (<font color='blue'><b>Scipio</b></font>) soldiers took it as a bad omen; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scipio</b></font>), clasping the soil with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scipio</b></font>) arms, exclaimed, `Thou canst not escape me, Africa, for I hold thee tight between my arms.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>The wise man and the Christian should not trifle with what it may please heaven to do. Thus, Sancho, meeting those images has been to me a most happy occurrence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I wish your worship would tell me what is the reason that the Spaniards, when they are about to give battle, in calling on that Saint James the Moorslayer, say `Santiago and close Spain!'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can well believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; Is Spain, then, open, so that it is needful to close it; or what is the meaning of this form?''
<p/>``God, look you, gave that great knight of the Red Cross to Spain as her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) patron saint and protector, especially in those hard struggles the Spaniards had with the Moors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) as their defender in all their battles; and in these he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) has been many a time seen beating down, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughtering the Hagarene squadrons in the sight of all; of which fact I could give thee many examples recorded in truthful Spanish histories.
<p/>Sancho changed the subject, and said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``I marvel, senor, at the boldness of Altisidora, the duchess's handmaid; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) whom they call Love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>); they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is a little blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speaking sightless, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it and pierces it through and through with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arrows.
<p/>I have heard it said too that the arrows of Love are blunted and robbed of their points by maidenly modesty and reserve; but with this Altisidora it seems they are sharpened rather than blunted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bear in mind, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that love is influenced by no consideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and is of the same nature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings and the humble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession of a heart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it; and so without shame Altisidora declared her (<font color='blue'><b>kings</b></font>) passion, which excited in my mind embarrassment rather than commiseration.
<p/>I can only say for myself that the very smallest loving word of hers would have subdued me and made a slave of me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>Thou art very simple, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote; '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Notable cruelty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``unheard-of ingratitude! The devil! What a heart of marble, what bowels of brass, what a soul of mortar!
<p/>But I can't imagine what it is that this damsel saw in your worship that could have conquered and captivated her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) so.
<p/>What gallant figure was it, what bold bearing, what sprightly grace, what comeliness of feature, which of these things by itself, or what all together, could have made her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) fall in love with you?
<p/>For indeed and in truth many a time I stop to look at your worship from the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your head, and I see more to frighten one than to make one fall in love; moreover I have heard say that beauty is the first and main thing that excites love, and as your worship has none at all, I don't know what the poor creature fell in love with.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Recollect, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, ``there are two sorts of beauty, one of the mind, the other of the body; that of the mind displays and exhibits itself in intelligence, in modesty, in honourable conduct, in generosity, in good breeding; and all these qualities are possible and may exist in an ugly man; and when it is this sort of beauty and not that of the body that is the attraction, love is apt to spring up suddenly and violently.
<p/>I, Sancho, perceive clearly enough that I am not beautiful, but at the same time I know I am not hideous; and it is enough for an honest man not to be a monster to be an object of love, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possesses the endowments of mind I have mentioned.
<p/>While engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a wood that lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting anything of the kind, Don Quixote found himself caught in some nets of green cord stretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceive what it could be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to Sancho, ``Sancho, it strikes me this affair of these nets will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable.
<p/>May I die if the enchanters that persecute me are not trying to entangle me in them and delay my journey, by way of revenge for my obduracy towards Altisidora.
<p/>Well then let me tell them that if these nets, instead of being green cord, were made of the hardest diamonds, or stronger than that wherewith the jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed Venus and Mars, I would break them as easily as if they were made of rushes or cotton threads.
<p/>But just as he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was about to press forward and break through all, suddenly from among some trees two shepherdesses of surpassing beauty presented themselves to his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sight--or at least damsels dressed like shepherdesses, save that their jerkins and sayas were of fine brocade; that is to say, the sayas were rich farthingales of gold embroidered tabby.
<p/>Their hair, that in its golden brightness vied with the beams of the sun itself, fell loose upon their shoulders and was crowned with garlands twined with green laurel and red everlasting; and their years to all appearance were not under fifteen nor above eighteen.
<p/>Such was the spectacle that filled Sancho with amazement, fascinated Don Quixote, made the sun halt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) course to behold them, and held all four in a strange silence.
<p/>One of the shepherdesses, at length, was the first to speak and said to Don Quixote, ``Hold, sir knight, and do not break these nets; for they are not spread here to do you any harm, but only for our amusement; and as I know you will ask why they have been put up, and who we are, I will tell you in a few words.
<p/>In a village some two leagues from this, where there are many people of quality and rich gentlefolk, it was agreed upon by a number of friends and relations to come with their wives, sons and daughters, neighbours, friends and kinsmen, and make holiday in this spot, which is one of the pleasantest in the whole neighbourhood, setting up a new pastoral Arcadia among ourselves, we maidens dressing ourselves as shepherdesses and the youths as shepherds.
<p/>We have prepared two eclogues, one by the famous poet Garcilasso, the other by the most excellent Camoens, in its own Portuguese tongue, but we have not as yet acted them.
<p/>Yesterday was the first day of our coming here; we have a few of what they say are called field-tents pitched among the trees on the bank of an ample brook that fertilises all these meadows; last night we spread these nets in the trees here to snare the silly little birds that startled by the noise we make may fly into them.
<p/>If you please to be our guest, senor, you will be welcomed heartily and courteously, for here just now neither care nor sorrow shall enter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) peace and said no more, and Don Quixote made answer, <div class="bookquote">``Of a truth, fairest lady, Actaeon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) unexpectedly beheld Diana bathing in the stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck than I at the sight of your beauty.
<p/>I commend your mode of entertainment, and thank you for the kindness of your invitation; and if I can serve you, you may command me with full confidence of being obeyed, for my profession is none other than to show myself grateful, and ready to serve persons of all conditions, but especially persons of quality such as your appearance indicates; and if, instead of taking up, as they probably do, but a small space, these nets took up the whole surface of the globe, I would seek out new worlds through which to pass, so as not to break them; and that ye may give some degree of credence to this exaggerated language of mine, know that it is no less than Don Quixote of La Mancha that makes this declaration to you, if indeed it be that such a name has reached your ears.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! friend of my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>the shepherdess</b></font>)</div>instantly exclaimed the other shepherdess, <div class="bookquote">``what great good fortune has befallen us! Seest thou this gentleman we have before us?
<p/>Well then let me tell thee he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is the most valiant and the most devoted and the most courteous gentleman in all the world, unless a history of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) achievements that has been printed and I have read is telling lies and deceiving us.
<p/>I will lay a wager that this good fellow who is with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is one Sancho Panza his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) squire, whose drolleries none can equal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the shepherdess</b></font>)</div><p/>That's true,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I am that same droll and squire you speak of, and this gentleman is my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, the same that's in the history and that they talk about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, my friend,'' said the other, <div class="bookquote">``let us entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to stay; for it will give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure; I too have heard
<p/>just what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the drolleries of the other; and what is more, of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) they say that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is the most constant and loyal lover that was ever heard of, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lady is one Dulcinea del Toboso, to whom all over Spain the palm of beauty is awarded.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>But spare yourselves the trouble, ladies, of pressing me to stay, for the urgent calls of my profession do not allow me to take rest under any circumstances.
<p/>At this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a brother of one of the two shepherdesses, like them in shepherd costume, and as richly and gaily dressed as they were.
<p/>They told him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) that their companion was the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, and the other Sancho his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) squire, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew already from having read their history.
<p/>The gay shepherd offered him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) services and begged that he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) would accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) to their tents, and Don Quixote had to give way and comply.
<p/>And now the game was started, and the nets were filled with a variety of birds that deceived by the colour fell into the danger they were flying from.
<p/>Upwards of thirty persons, all gaily attired as shepherds and shepherdesses, assembled on the spot, and were at once informed who Don Quixote and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire were, whereat they were not a little delighted, as they knew of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) already through his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) history.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``And justly awarded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``unless, indeed, your unequalled beauty makes it a matter of doubt. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>They repaired to the tents, where they found tables laid out, and choicely, plentifully, and neatly furnished.
<p/>They treated Don Quixote as a person of distinction, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) the place of honour, and all observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and were full of astonishment at the spectacle.
<p/>At last the cloth being removed, Don Quixote with great composure lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) voice and said: <div class="bookquote">``One of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is--some will say pride--but I say ingratitude, going by the common saying that hell is full of ingrates.
<p/>This sin, so far as it has lain in my power, I have endeavoured to avoid ever since I have enjoyed the faculty of reason; and if I am unable to requite good deeds that have been done me by other deeds, I substitute the desire to do so; and if that be not enough I make them known publicly; for he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) who declares and makes known the good deeds done to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would repay them by others if it were in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) power, and for the most part those who receive are the inferiors of those who give.
<p/>Thus, God is superior to all because he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is the supreme giver, and the offerings of man fall short by an infinite distance of being a full return for the gifts of God; but gratitude in some degree makes up for this deficiency and shortcoming.
<p/>I therefore, grateful for the favour that has been extended to me here, and unable to make a return in the same measure, restricted as I am by the narrow limits of my power, offer what I can and what I have to offer in my own way; and so I declare that for two full days I will maintain in the middle of this highway leading to Saragossa, that these ladies disguised as shepherdesses, who are here present, are the fairest and most courteous maidens in the world, excepting only the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole mistress of my thoughts,
<p/>be it said without offence to those who hear me, ladies and gentlemen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>On hearing this Sancho, who had been listening with great attention, cried out in a loud voice,
<p/>``Is it possible there is anyone in the world who will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman?
<p/>Say, gentlemen shepherds, is there a village priest, be he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) ever so wise or learned, who could say what my master has said; or is there knight-errant, whatever renown he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) may have as a man of valour, that could offer what my master has offered now?
<p/>Don Quixote turned upon Sancho, and with a countenance glowing with anger said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Is it possible, Sancho, there is anyone in the whole world who will say thou art not a fool, with a lining to match, and I know not what trimmings of impertinence and roguery?

<p/>Hold thy peace; answer me not a word; saddle Rocinante if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be unsaddled; and let us go to put my offer into execution; for with the right that I have on my side thou mayest reckon as vanquished all who shall venture to question it;'' and in a great rage, and showing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger plainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat, leaving the company lost in wonder, and making them feel doubtful whether they ought to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a madman or a rational being.
<p/>In the end, though they sought to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from involving himself in such a challenge, assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) they admitted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gratitude as fully established, and needed no fresh proofs to be convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) valiant spirit, as those related in the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exploits were sufficient, still Don Quixote persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) resolve; and mounted on Rocinante, bracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) buckler on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arm and grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) posted himself in the middle of a high road that was not far from the green meadow.
<p/>Sancho followed on Dapple, together with all the members of the pastoral gathering, eager to see what would be the upshot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) vainglorious and extraordinary proposal.
<p/>Don Quixote, then, having, as has been said, planted himself in the middle of the road, made the welkin ring with words to this effect: ``Ho ye travellers and wayfarers, knights, squires, folk on foot or on horseback, who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the next two days!
<p/>Know that Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant, is posted here to maintain by arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in the nymphs that dwell in these meadows and groves surpass all upon earth, putting aside the lady of my heart, Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by any adventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) from better to better, so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on the road a crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their hands, all riding in a compact body and in great haste.
<p/>No sooner had those who were with Don Quixote seen them than they turned about and withdrew to some distance from the road, for they knew that if they stayed some harm might come to them; but Don Quixote with intrepid heart stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ground, and Sancho Panza shielded himself with Rocinante's hind-quarters.
<p/>The troop of lancers came up, and one of them who was in advance began shouting to Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``Get out of the way, you son of the devil, or these bulls will knock you to pieces!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Wherefore, let him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) who is of the opposite opinion come on, for here I await him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). '' <div class="bookquote">``Rabble! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I care nothing for bulls, be they the fiercest Jarama breeds on its banks.
<p/>Confess at once, scoundrels, that what I have declared is true; else ye have to deal with me in combat. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>The herdsman had no time to reply, nor Don Quixote to get out of the way even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wished; and so the drove of fierce bulls and tame bullocks, together with the crowd of herdsmen and others who were taking them to be penned up in a village where they were to be run the next day, passed over Don Quixote and over Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple, hurling them all to the earth and rolling them over on the ground.
<p/>They all got up, however, at length, and Don Quixote in great haste, stumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove, shouting out, <div class="bookquote">``Hold!
<p/>ye rascally rabble, a single knight awaits you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is not of the temper or opinion of those who say, `For a flying enemy make a bridge of silver.'
<p/>The retreating party in their haste, however, did not stop for that, or heed his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) menaces any more than last year's clouds.
<p/>Weariness brought Don Quixote to a halt, and more enraged than avenged he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sat down on the road to wait until Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple came up.
<p/>When they reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master and man mounted once more, and without going back to bid farewell to the mock or imitation Arcadia, and more in humiliation than contentment, they continued their journey.
<p/>Sancho was left crushed, Don Quixote scared, Dapple belaboured and Rocinante in no very sound condition. stay! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER LIX. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE THING, WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS
<p/>A clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved Don Quixote and Sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite behaviour of the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned Dapple and Rocinante loose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair, master and man, seated themselves.
<p/>Sancho had recourse to the larder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) alforjas and took out of them what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) called the prog; Don Quixote rinsed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mouth and bathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face, by which cooling process his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) flagging energies were revived.
<p/>Sancho did not venture to touch a morsel of what was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), but waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master to act as taster.
<p/>Seeing, however, that, absorbed in thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was forgetting to carry the bread to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said never a word, and trampling every sort of good breeding under foot, began to stow away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) paunch the bread and cheese that came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Eat, Sancho my friend,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``support life, which is of more consequence to thee than to me, and leave me to die under the pain of my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes.
<p/>I was born, Sancho, to live dying, and thou to die eating; and to prove the truth of what I say, look at me, printed in histories, famed in arms, courteous in behaviour, honoured by princes, courted by maidens; and after all, when I looked forward to palms, triumphs, and crowns, won and earned by my valiant deeds, I have this morning seen myself trampled on, kicked, and crushed by the feet of unclean and filthy animals.
<p/>This thought blunts my teeth, paralyses my jaws, cramps my hands, and robs me of all appetite for food; so much so that I have a mind to let myself die of hunger, the cruelest death of all deaths.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>AN ADVENTURE, THAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE Out of pure vexation he (<font color='blue'><b>DON</b></font>) remained without eating, and out of pure politeness '' ''
<p/>So then,'' said Sancho, munching hard all the time, ``your worship does not agree with the proverb that says, `Let Martha die, but let her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) die with a full belly.'
<p/>I, at any rate, have no mind to kill myself; so far from that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, who stretches the leather with his (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) teeth until he (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) makes it reach as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>cobbler</b></font>) wants.
<p/>I'll stretch out my life by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it; and let me tell you, senor, there's no greater folly than to think of dying of despair as your worship does; take my advice, and after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this green grass-mattress, and you will see that when you awake you'll feel something better.
<p/>Don Quixote did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) recommended, for it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that Sancho's reasoning was more like a philosopher's than a blockhead's, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Sancho, if thou wilt do for me what I am going to tell thee my ease of mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not so great; and it is this; to go aside a little while I am sleeping in accordance with thy advice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, to give thyself three or four hundred lashes with Rocinante's reins, on account of the three thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for the disenchantment of Dulcinea; for it is a great pity that the poor lady should be left enchanted through thy carelessness and negligence.
<p/>There is a good deal to be said on that point,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``let us both go to sleep now, and after that, God has decreed what will happen.
<p/>Let me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in cold blood is a hard thing, especially if the stripes fall upon an ill-nourished and worse-fed body.
<p/>Let my lady Dulcinea have patience, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) is least expecting it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) will see me made a riddle of with whipping, and `until death it's all life;' I mean that I have still life in me, and the desire to make good what I have promised.
<p/>Don Quixote thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and ate a little, and Sancho a good deal, and then they both lay down to sleep, leaving those two inseparable friends and comrades, Rocinante and Dapple, to their own devices and to feed unrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was furnished.
<p/>They woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumed their journey, pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight, apparently a league off.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' I say an inn, because Don Quixote called it so, contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) usual practice of calling all inns castles.
<p/>They reached it, and asked the landlord if they could put up there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said yes, with as much comfort and as good fare as they could find in Saragossa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took the beasts to the stable, fed them, and came back to see what orders Don Quixote, who was seated on a bench at the door, had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), giving special thanks to heaven that this inn had not been taken for a castle by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master.
<p/>Supper-time came, and they repaired to their room, and Sancho asked the landlord what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had to give them for supper.
<p/>To this the landlord replied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mouth should be the measure; he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had only to ask what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would; for that inn was provided with the birds of the air and the fowls of the earth and the fish of the sea.
<p/>There's no need of all that,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``if they'll roast us a couple of chickens we'll be satisfied, for my master is delicate and eats little, and I'm not over and above gluttonous.
<p/>They dismounted, and Sancho stowed away his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) larder in a room of which the landlord gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the key. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>The landlord replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had no chickens, for the kites had stolen them. '' Well then,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``let senor landlord tell them to roast a pullet, so that it is a tender one.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By God,''  (<font color='red'><b>guest</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, ``my guest's wits must be precious dull; I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) I have neither pullets nor hens, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) wants me to have eggs!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pullet!

<p/>Here ended Sancho's conversation with the landlord, Sancho not caring to carry it any farther by answering him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had already asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) what calling or what profession it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was of.

<p/>It seems that in another room, which was next to Don Quixote's, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) overheard these words, ``As you live, Senor Don Jeronimo, while they are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of `Don Quixote of La Mancha.'
<p/>The instant Don Quixote heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) started to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet and listened with open ears to catch what they said about him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and heard the Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, <div class="bookquote">``Why would you have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone who has read the First Part of the history of `Don Quixote of La Mancha' to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Jeronimo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who was addressed as Don Juan, ``we shall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad
<p/>What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote as now cured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) love for Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) voice and said, <div class="bookquote">``Whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) may be who says that Don Quixote of La Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with equal arms that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) says is very far from the truth; for neither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) motto is constancy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) profession to maintain the same with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) life and never wrong it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>but it has something good in it. '' '' '' Who is this that answers us?'' said they in the next room.
<p/>Who should it be,'' said Sancho, ``but Don Quixote of La Mancha himself, who will make good all he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has said and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) will say; for pledges don't trouble a good payer.
<p/>Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arms round Don Quixote's neck, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Your appearance cannot leave any question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your appearance; unquestionably, senor, you are the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in defiance of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught your achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you has done;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and with this he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) put a book which his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) companion carried into the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eye over it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) presently returned it saying, <div class="bookquote">``In the little I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve to be censured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Faith, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, ``this new author does not handle you with the decency that displays itself in your person; he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) makes you out a heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very different being from the Sancho described in the First Part of your master's history.

<p/>The two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have supper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn fit for one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sort.
<p/>Sancho stayed behind with the stew. and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head of the table, and the landlord sat down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was no less fond of cow-heel and calves' feet than Sancho was.
<p/>While at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) married,
<p/>had she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) been brought to bed, or was she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) with child, or did she (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) in maidenhood, still preserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) modesty and delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of Senor Don Quixote?
<p/>To this he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Dulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion more firmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) proceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment of Dulcinea, and of what had happened him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in the cave of Montesinos, together with what the sage Merlin had prescribed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Toboso</b></font>) disenchantment, namely the scourging of Sancho.
<p/>Exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from hearing Don Quixote recount the strange incidents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) history; and if they were amazed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) absurdities they were equally amazed by the elegant style in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) delivered them.
<p/>On the one hand they regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as a man of wit and sense, and on the other he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) seemed to them a maundering blockhead, and they could not make up their minds whereabouts between wisdom and folly they ought to place him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Sancho having finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) supper, and left the landlord in the X condition, repaired to the room where his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master was, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came in said, <div class="bookquote">``May I die, sirs,

<p/>A considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort, and though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the book to see what it was all about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was not to be prevailed upon, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by any chance it should come to its author's ears that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) had it in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) to flatter himself with the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) had read it; for our thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep themselves aloof from what is obscene and filthy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Juan/Juan</b></font>)</div>They asked him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) whither he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) meant to direct his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) steps. He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) replied, to Saragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that city every year.
<p/>Don Juan told him (<font color='blue'><b>Juan</b></font>) that the new history described how Don Quixote, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) be who he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might, took part there in a tilting at the ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume, though rich in sillinesses.
<p/>For that very reason,'' said Don Quixote, ``I will not set foot in Saragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the lie of this new history writer, and people will see that I am not the Don Quixote he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) speaks of.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will do quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Jeronimo</b></font>)</div>said Don Jeronimo; <div class="bookquote">``and there are other jousts at Barcelona in which Senor Don Quixote may display his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) prowess.

<p/>With this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired to their room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the medley he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) made of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) good sense and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) craziness; and they felt thoroughly convinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author described, were the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' And me too,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``maybe I'll be good for something. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Don Quixote rose betimes, and bade adieu to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hosts by knocking at the partition of the other room.
<p/>Sancho paid the landlord magnificently, and recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) either to say less about the providing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) inn or to keep it better provided.
<p/>It was a fresh morning giving promise of a cool day as Don Quixote quitted the inn, first of all taking care to ascertain the most direct road to Barcelona without touching upon Saragossa; so anxious was he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to make out this new historian, who they said abused him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) so, to be a liar.
<p/>CHAPTER LX. OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON HIS (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) WAY TO BARCELONA Well, as it fell out, nothing worthy of being recorded happened him (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) for six days, at the end of which
<p/>, having turned aside out of the road, he (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) was overtaken by night in a thicket of oak or cork trees; for on this point Cide Hamete is not as precise as he (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) usually is on other matters.
<p/>Master and man dismounted from their beasts, and as soon as they had settled themselves at the foot of the trees, Sancho, who had had a good noontide meal that day, let himself, without more ado, pass the gates of sleep.
<p/>But Don Quixote, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thoughts, far more than hunger, kept awake, could not close an eye, and roamed in fancy to and fro through all sorts of places.
<p/>At one moment it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was in the cave of Montesinos and saw Dulcinea, transformed into a country wench, skipping and mounting upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) she-ass; again that the words of the sage Merlin were sounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) ears, setting forth the conditions to be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) lost all patience when he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) considered the laziness and want of charity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) squire Sancho; for to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) belief he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had only given himself five lashes, a number paltry and disproportioned to the vast number required.
<p/>At this thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt such vexation and anger that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) reasoned the matter thus: ``If Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot, saying, `To cut comes to the same thing as to untie,' and yet did not fail to become lord paramount of all Asia, neither more nor less could happen now in Dulcinea's disenchantment if I scourge Sancho against his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) will; for, if it is the condition of the remedy that Sancho shall receive three thousand and odd lashes, what does it matter to me whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) inflicts them himself, or some one else inflicts them, when the essential point is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) receives them, let them come from whatever quarter they may?
<p/>With this idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) went over to Sancho, having first taken Rocinante's reins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with them, and began to untie the points
<p/>-LRB-the common belief is he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had but one in front-RRB- by which his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) breeches were held up; but the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) Sancho woke up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) full senses and cried out, <div class="bookquote">``What is this?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Who is touching me and untrussing me?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and I come to make good thy shortcomings and relieve my own distresses
<p/>; I come to whip thee, Sancho, and wipe off some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken. Dulcinea is perishing,
<p/>, I am dying of hope deferred; therefore untruss thyself with a good will, for mine it is, here, in this retired spot, to give thee at least two thousand lashes.
<p/>thou art living on regardless ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``let your worship keep quiet, or else by the living God
<p/>the deaf shall hear us; the lashes I pledged myself to must be voluntary and not forced upon me, and just now I have no fancy to whip myself
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of flesh;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) strove and struggled to untie him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Seeing this Sancho got up, and grappling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gripped him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arms, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a trip with the heel stretched him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on the ground on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) back, and pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) right knee on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) chest held his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could neither move nor breathe.
<p/>; it is enough if I give you my word to flog and flap myself when I have a mind.'' ''
<p/>How now, traitor! '' exclaimed Don Quixote. '' Dost thou revolt against thy master and natural lord? Dost thou rise against him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) who gives thee his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) bread?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I neither put down king, nor set up king,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``I only stand up for myself who am my own lord; if your worship promises me to be quiet, and not to offer to whip me now, I'll let you go free and unhindered; if not-- Traitor and Dona Sancha's foe, Thou diest on the spot.
<p/>Don Quixote gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) promise, and swore by the life of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thoughts not to touch so much as a hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) garments, and to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) entirely free and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own discretion to whip himself whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pleased.
<p/>Sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was about to place himself leaning against another tree he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) felt something touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head, and putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hands encountered somebody's two feet with shoes and stockings on them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) trembled with fear and made for another tree, where the very same thing happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fell a-shouting, calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Don Quixote did so, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was afraid of. Sancho replied that all the trees were full of men's feet and legs.
<p/>Don Quixote felt them, and guessed at once what it was, and said to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Thou hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and legs that thou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws and freebooters that have been hanged on these trees; for the authorities in these parts are wont to hang them up by twenties and thirties when they catch them; whereby I conjecture that I must be near Barcelona;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and it was, in fact, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) supposed; with the first light they looked up and saw that the fruit hanging on those trees were freebooters' bodies.
<p/>And now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, their hearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who all of a sudden surrounded them, and in the Catalan tongue bade them stand and wait until their captain came up.
<p/>Don Quixote was on foot with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) horse unbridled and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance leaning against a tree, and in short completely defenceless; he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought it best therefore to fold his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arms and bow his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity.
<p/>The robbers made haste to search Dapple, and did not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a single thing of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) carried in the alforjas and in the valise; and lucky it was for Sancho that the duke's crowns and those he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) brought from home were in a girdle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wore round him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but for all that these good folk would have stripped him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and even looked to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had hidden between the skin and flesh, but for the arrival at that moment of their captain, who was about thirty-four years of age apparently, strongly built, above the middle height, of stern aspect and swarthy complexion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was mounted upon a powerful horse, and had on a coat of mail, with four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) waist.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) squires -LRB-for so they call those who follow that trade-RRB- were about to rifle Sancho Panza, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed, so the girdle escaped.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) wondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shield on the ground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Be not so cast down, good man, for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but into Roque Guinart's, which are more merciful than cruel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>O valiant Roque, whose fame is bounded by no limits on earth, but that my carelessness should have been so great that thy soldiers should have caught me unbridled, when it is my duty, according to the rule of knight-errantry which I profess, to be always on the alert and at all times my own sentinel; for let me tell thee, great Roque, had they found me on my horse, with my lance and shield, it would not have been very easy for them to reduce me to submission, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,
<p/>'' The cause of my dejection,'' returned Don Quixote, ``is not that I have fallen into thy hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who hath filled the whole world with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) achievements.
<p/>Roque Guinart at once perceived that Don Quixote's weakness was more akin to madness than to swagger; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had sometimes heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spoken of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) never regarded the things attributed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as true, nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) persuade himself that such a humour could become dominant in the heart of man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was extremely glad, therefore, to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and test at close quarters what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at a distance; so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ``Despair not, valiant knight, nor regard as an untoward fate the position in which thou findest thyself; it may be that by these slips thy crooked fortune will make itself straight; for heaven by strange circuitous ways, mysterious and incomprehensible to man, raises up the fallen and makes rich the poor.
<p/>Don Quixote was about to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), when they heard behind them a noise as of a troop of horses; there was, however, but one, riding on which at a furious pace came a youth, apparently about twenty years of age, clad in green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock, with a hat looped up in the Walloon fashion, tight-fitting polished boots, gilt spurs, dagger and sword, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand a musketoon, and a pair of pistols at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) waist.
<p/>Roque turned round at the noise and perceived this comely figure, which drawing near thus addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I came in quest of thee, valiant Roque, to find in thee if not a remedy at least relief in my misfortune; and not to keep thee in suspense, for I see thou dost not recognise me, I will tell thee who I am; I am Claudia Jeronima, the daughter of Simon Forte, thy good friend, and special enemy of Clauquel Torrellas, who is thine also as being of the faction opposed to thee.
<p/>Thou knowest that this Torrellas has a son who is called, or at least was not two hours since, Don Vicente Torrellas.
<p/>Well, to cut short the tale of my misfortune, I will tell thee in a few words what this youth has brought upon me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) saw me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) paid court to me, I listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>), and, unknown to my father, I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); for there is no woman,
<p/>however secluded she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may live or close she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be kept, who will not have opportunities and to spare for following her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) headlong impulses.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' In a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pledged himself to be mine, and I promised to be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), without carrying matters any further.
<p/>Yesterday I learned that, forgetful of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pledge to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was about to marry another, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to go this morning to plight his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) troth, intelligence which overwhelmed and exasperated me; my father not being at home
<p/>I was able to adopt this costume you see, and urging my horse to speed I overtook Don Vicente about a league from this, and without waiting to utter reproaches or hear excuses I fired this musket at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>), and these two pistols besides, and to the best of my belief I must have lodged more than two bullets in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) body, opening doors to let my honour go free, enveloped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) blood.
<p/>I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) there in the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) servants, who did not dare and were not able to interfere in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) defence, and I come to seek from thee a safe-conduct into France, where I have relatives with whom I can live; and also to implore thee to protect my father, so that Don Vicente's numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak their lawless vengeance upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>).
<p/>Roque, filled with admiration at the gallant bearing, high spirit, comely figure, and adventure of the fair Claudia, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>), ``Come, senora, let us go and see if thy enemy is dead; and then we will consider what will be best for thee.
<p/>Don Quixote, who had been listening to what Claudia said and Roque Guinart said in reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>), exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Nobody need trouble himself with the defence of this lady, for I take it upon myself.
<p/>Give me my horse and arms, and wait for me here; I will go in quest of this knight, and dead or alive I will make him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) keep his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) word plighted to so great beauty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody need have any doubt about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for my master has a very happy knack of matchmaking; it's not many days since he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) forced another man to marry, who in the same way backed out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) promise to another maiden; and if it had not been for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) persecutors the enchanters changing the man's proper shape into a lacquey's the said maiden would not be one this minute.
<p/>Roque, who was paying more attention to the fair Claudia's adventure than to the words of master or man, did not hear them; and ordering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) squires to restore to Sancho everything they had stripped Dapple of, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directed them to return to the place where they had been quartered during the night, and then set off with Claudia at full speed in search of the wounded or slain Don Vicente.
<p/>They reached the spot where Claudia met him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>), but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood; looking all round, however, they descried some people on the slope of a hill above them, and concluded, as indeed it proved to be, that it was Don Vicente, whom either dead or alive his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) servants were removing to attend to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) wounds or to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' They made haste to overtake them, which, as the party moved slowly, they were able to do with ease.
<p/>They found Don Vicente in the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) servants, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) was entreating in a broken feeble voice to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) there to die, as the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) wounds would not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) to go any farther.
<p/>Claudia and Roque threw themselves off their horses and advanced towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>); the servants were overawed by the appearance of Roque, and Claudia was moved by the sight of Don Vicente, and going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) half tenderly half sternly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) hand and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>), ``Hadst thou given me this according to our compact thou hadst never come to this pass.
<p/>The wounded gentleman opened his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) all but closed eyes, and recognising Claudia said, ``I see clearly, fair and mistaken lady, that it is thou that hast slain me, a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings towards thee, for never did I mean to, nor could I, wrong thee in thought or deed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not true, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Claudia/Claudia Jeronima</b></font>)</div>said Claudia, <div class="bookquote">``that thou wert going this morning to marry Leonora the daughter of the rich Balvastro?''

<p/>Claudia wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) own heart was so wrung that she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) lay fainting on the bleeding breast of Don Vicente, whom a death spasm seized the same instant.
<p/>Roque was in perplexity and knew not what to do; the servants ran to fetch water to sprinkle their faces, and brought some and bathed them with it.
<p/>Claudia recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) fainting fit, but not so Don Vicente from the paroxysm that had overtaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) life had come to an end.
<p/>On perceiving this, Claudia, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) had convinced herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) beloved husband was no more, rent the air with her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) sighs and made the heavens ring with her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) lamentations; she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) hair and scattered it to the winds, she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an afflicted heart.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So vehement and so piteous were the lamentations of Claudia that they drew tears from Roque's eyes, unused as they were to shed them on any occasion.
<p/>The servants wept, Claudia swooned away again and again, and the whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune.
<p/>In the end Roque Guinart directed Don Vicente's servants to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) body to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) father's village, which was close by, for burial.
<p/>Claudia told him (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was abbess, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) intended to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) life with a better and everlasting spouse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) applauded her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) pious resolution, and offered to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) whithersoever she (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) wished, and to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Claudia</b></font>) father against the kinsmen of Don Vicente and all the world, should they seek to injure him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>).

<p/>The servants of Don Vicente carried away his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicente</b></font>) body, and Roque returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) comrades, and so ended the love of Claudia Jeronima; but what wonder, when it was the insuperable and cruel might of jealousy that wove the web of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jeronima</b></font>) sad story?
<p/>Roque Guinart found his (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) squires at the place to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) had ordered them, and Don Quixote on Rocinante in the midst of them delivering a harangue to them in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) urged them to give up a mode of life so full of peril, as well to the soul as to the body; but as most of them were Gascons, rough lawless fellows, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) speech did not make much impression on them.
<p/>Roque on coming up asked Sancho if his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) men had returned and restored to him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) the treasures and jewels they had stripped off Dapple.
<p/>Claudia would not on any account Sancho said they had, but that three kerchiefs that were worth three cities were missing.
<p/>What are you talking about, man?'' said one of the bystanders; ``I have got them, and they are not worth three reals.

<p/>Roque Guinart ordered them to be restored at once; and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) men fall in in line he (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) directed all the clothing, jewellery, and money that they had taken since the last distribution to be produced; and making a hasty valuation, and reducing what could not be divided into money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) made shares for the whole band so equitably and carefully, that in no case did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) exceed or fall short of strict distributive justice.
<p/>When this had been done, and all left satisfied, Roque observed to Don Quixote, ``If this scrupulous exactness were not observed with these fellows there would be no living with them.
<p/>Upon this Sancho remarked, ``From what I have seen here, justice is such a good thing that there is no doing without it, even among the thieves themselves.
<p/>One of the squires heard this, and raising the butt-end of his (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) harquebuss would no doubt have broken Sancho's head with it had not Roque Guinart called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Sancho was frightened out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wits, and vowed not to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lips so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was in the company of these people.
<p/>At this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads, to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief, came up and said, ``Senor, there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to Barcelona.
<p/>To which Roque replied, <div class="bookquote">``Hast thou made out whether they are of the sort that are after us, or of the sort we are after?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Roque/Roque Guinart</b></font>)</div><p/>Well then, away with you all,'' said Roque, ``and bring them here to me at once without letting one of them escape.
<p/>They obeyed, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and Roque, left by themselves, waited to see what the squires brought, and while they were waiting Roque said to Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``It must seem a strange sort of life to Senor Don Quixote, this of ours, strange adventures, strange incidents, and all full of danger; and I do not wonder that it should seem so, for in truth I must own there is no mode of life more restless or anxious than ours.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' '' The sort we are after,'' said the squire. '' '' What led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance, which is strong enough to disturb the quietest hearts.
<p/>I am by nature tender-hearted and kindly, but, as I said, the desire to revenge myself for a wrong that was done me so overturns all my better impulses that I keep on in this way of life in spite of what conscience tells me; and as one depth calls to another, and one sin to another sin,
<p/>: it pleases God, however, that, though I see myself in this maze of entanglements, I do not lose all hope of escaping from it and reaching a safe port.
<p/>Don Quixote was amazed to hear Roque utter such excellent and just sentiments, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not think that among those who followed such trades as robbing, murdering, and waylaying, there could be anyone capable of a virtuous thought, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said in reply, <div class="bookquote">``Senor Roque, the beginning of health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick man's willingness to take the medicines which the physician prescribes; you are sick, you know what ails you, and heaven, or more properly speaking God, who is our physician, will administer medicines that will cure you, and cure gradually, and not of a sudden or by a miracle; besides, sinners of discernment are nearer amendment than those who are fools; and as your worship has shown good sense in your remarks, all you have to do is to keep up a good heart and trust that the weakness of your conscience will be strengthened.
<p/>And if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation, come with me, and I will show you how to become a knight-errant, a calling wherein
<p/>so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice.
<p/>revenges have linked themselves together, and I have taken upon myself not only my own but those of others ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Roque laughed at Don Quixote's exhortation, and changing the conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) related the tragic affair of Claudia Jeronima, at which Sancho was extremely grieved; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had not found the young woman's beauty, boldness, and spirit at all amiss.
<p/>And now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach full of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on them, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them.
<p/>The squires made a ring round them, both victors and vanquished maintaining profound silence, waiting for the great Roque Guinart to speak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) asked the gentlemen who they were, whither they were going, and what money they carried with them; <div class="bookquote">``Senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>replied one of them, ``we are two captains of Spanish infantry; our companies are at Naples, and we are on our way to embark in four galleys which they say are at Barcelona under orders for Sicily; and we have about two or three hundred crowns, with which we are, according to our notions, rich and contented, for a soldier's poverty does not allow a more extensive hoard.
<p/>Roque asked the pilgrims the same questions he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) had put to the captains, and was answered that they were going to take ship for Rome, and that between them they might have about sixty reals.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) asked also who was in the coach, whither they were bound and what money they had, and one of the men on horseback replied, <div class="bookquote">``The persons in the coach are my lady Dona Guiomar de Quinones, wife of the regent of the Vicaria at Naples, her (<font color='blue'><b>Quinones</b></font>) little daughter, a handmaid and a duenna; we six servants are in attendance upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Quinones</b></font>), and the money amounts to six hundred crowns.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>So then,'' said Roque Guinart, ``we have got here nine hundred crowns and sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see how much there falls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician.
<p/>As soon as the robbers heard this they raised a shout of ``Long life to Roque Guinart, in spite of the lladres that seek his (<font color='blue'><b>Guinart</b></font>) ruin!
<p/>The captains showed plainly the concern they felt, the regent's lady was downcast, and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated.
<p/>Roque kept them in suspense in this way for a while; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) had no desire to prolong their distress, which might be seen a bowshot off, and turning to the captains he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Sirs, will your worships be pleased of your courtesy to lend me sixty crowns, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ladyship the regent's wife eighty, to satisfy this band that follows me, for `it is by his (<font color='blue'><b>regent</b></font>) singing the abbot gets his (<font color='blue'><b>regent</b></font>) dinner;' and then you may at once proceed on your journey, free and unhindered, with a safe-conduct which I shall give you, so that if you come across any other bands of mine that I have scattered in these parts, they may do you no harm
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' ; for I have no intention of doing injury to soldiers, or to any woman, especially one of quality.
<p/>Profuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with which the captains thanked Roque for his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) courtesy and generosity; for such they regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) leaving them their own money.
<p/>Senora Dona Guiomar de Quinones wanted to throw herself out of the coach to kiss the feet and hands of the great Roque, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) would not suffer it on any account; so far from that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Dona</b></font>) pardon for the wrong he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Dona</b></font>) under pressure of the inexorable necessities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) unfortunate calling.
<p/>The regent's lady ordered one of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) servants to give the eighty crowns that had been assessed as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) share at once, for the captains had already paid down their sixty.
<p/>The pilgrims were about to give up the whole of their little hoard, but Roque bade them keep quiet, and turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) men he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Of these crowns two fall to each man and twenty remain over; let ten be given to these pilgrims, and the other ten to this worthy squire that he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) may be able to speak favourably of this adventure;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then having writing materials, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) always went provided, brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) gave them in writing a safe-conduct to the leaders of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) bands; and bidding them farewell let them go free and filled with admiration at his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) magnanimity, his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) generous disposition, and his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) unusual conduct, and inclined to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) as an Alexander the Great rather than a notorious robber.
<p/>One of the squires observed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) mixture of Gascon and Catalan, ``This captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wants to be so generous another time, let it be with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) own property and not ours.
<p/>The unlucky wight did not speak so low but that Roque overheard him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>), and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) sword almost split his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) head in two, saying, <div class="bookquote">``That is the way I punish impudent saucy fellows.
<p/>They were all taken aback, and not one of them dared to utter a word, such deference did they pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>).
<p/>Roque then withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) at Barcelona, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) that the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the knight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), the drollest and wisest man in the world; and that in four days from that date, that is to say, on Saint John the Baptist's Day, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was going to deposit him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in full armour mounted on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) horse Rocinante, together with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) squire Sancho on an ass, in the middle of the strand of the city; and bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) give notice of this to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) friends the Niarros, that they might divert themselves with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wished, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) enemies the Cadells could be deprived of this pleasure; but that was impossible, because the crazes and shrewd sayings of Don Quixote and the humours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire Sancho Panza could not help giving general pleasure to all the world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) despatched the letter by one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squires, who, exchanging the costume of a highwayman for that of a peasant, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) way into Barcelona and gave it to the person to whom it was directed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' CHAPTER LXI. OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON ENTERING BARCELONA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS THAT PARTAKE OF THE TRUE
<p/>RATHER THAN OF THE INGENIOUS Don Quixote passed three days and three nights with Roque, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) passed three hundred years he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) would have found enough to observe and wonder at in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) mode of life.
<p/>At daybreak they were in one spot, at dinner-time in another; sometimes they fled without knowing from whom, at other times they lay in wait, not knowing for what.
<p/>There was nothing but sending out spies and scouts, posting sentinels and blowing the matches of harquebusses, though they carried but few, for almost all used flintlocks.
<p/>Roque passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) nights in some place or other apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) men, that they might not know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) was, for the many proclamations the viceroy of Barcelona had issued against his (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) life kept him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) in fear and uneasiness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) did not venture to trust anyone, afraid that even his (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) own men would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) or deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) up to the authorities; of a truth, a weary miserable life!
<p/>At length, by unfrequented roads, short cuts, and secret paths, Roque, Don Quixote, and Sancho, together with six squires, set out for Barcelona.
<p/>They reached the strand on Saint John's Eve during the night; and Roque, after embracing Don Quixote and Sancho -LRB-to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) presented the ten crowns he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had promised but had not until then given-RRB-, left them with many expressions of good-will on both sides.
<p/>Roque went back, while Don Quixote remained on horseback, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was, waiting for day, and it was not long before the countenance of the fair Aurora began to show itself at the balconies of the east, gladdening the grass and flowers, if not the ear, though to gladden that too there came at the same moment a sound of clarions and drums, and a din of bells, and a tramp, tramp, and cries of <div class="bookquote">``Clear the way there!''  (<font color='red'><b>tramp</b></font>)</div>of some runners, that seemed to issue from the city.
<p/>The dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader than a buckler began to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon; Don Quixote and Sancho gazed all round them; they beheld the sea, a sight until then unseen by them; it struck them as exceedingly spacious and broad, much more so than the lakes of Ruidera which they had seen in La Mancha.
<p/>They saw the galleys along the beach, which, lowering their awnings, displayed themselves decked with streamers and pennons that trembled in the breeze and kissed and swept the water, while on board the bugles, trumpets, and clarions were sounding and filling the air far and near with melodious warlike notes.
<p/>Then they began to move and execute a kind of skirmish upon the calm water, while a vast number of horsemen on fine horses and in showy liveries, issuing from the city, engaged on their side in a somewhat similar movement.
<p/>The soldiers on board the galleys kept up a ceaseless fire, which they on the walls and forts of the city returned, and the heavy cannon rent the air with the tremendous noise they made, to which the gangway guns of the galleys replied.
<p/>The bright sea, the smiling earth, the clear air--though at times darkened by the smoke of the guns--all seemed to fill the whole multitude with unexpected delight.
<p/>Sancho could not make out how it was that those great masses that moved over the sea had so many feet.
<p/>And now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and outlandish cries and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed and wondering; and one of them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to whom Roque had sent word, addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) exclaimed, ``Welcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosure of all knight-errantry in its widest extent!
<p/>Welcome, I say, valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the apocryphal, that these latter days have offered us in lying histories, but the true, the legitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli, flower of historians, has described to us!
<p/>Don Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, but wheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting round Don Quixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, <div class="bookquote">``These gentlemen have plainly recognised us
<p/>They slept standing, breaking their slumbers to shift from place to place. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>; I will wager they have read our history, and even that newly printed one by the Aragonese.
<p/>The cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come with us, Senor Don Quixote, for we are all of us your servants and great friends of Roque Guinart's;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to which Don Quixote returned, <div class="bookquote">``If courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is daughter or very nearly akin to the great Roque's; carry me where you please; I will have no will but yours, especially if you deign to employ it in your service.
<p/>The cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing in around him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>), they set out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Roque</b></font>) for the city, to the music of the clarions and the drums.
<p/>As they were entering it, the wicked one, who is the author of all mischief, and the boys who are wickeder than the wicked one, contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressible urchins should force their way through the crowd, and lifting up, one of them Dapple's tail and the other Rocinante's, insert a bunch of furze under each.
<p/>The poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added to their anguish by pressing their tails tight, so much so that, cutting a multitude of capers, they flung their masters to the ground.
<p/>Don Quixote, covered with shame and out of countenance, ran to pluck the plume from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) poor jade's tail, while Sancho did the same for Dapple.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) conductors tried to punish the audacity of the boys, but there was no possibility of doing so, for they hid themselves among the hundreds of others that were following them.
<p/>Don Quixote and Sancho mounted once more, and with the same music and acclamations reached their conductor's house, which was large and stately, that of a rich gentleman, in short; and there for the present we will leave them, for such is Cide Hamete's pleasure.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER LXII. WHICH DEALS WITH THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED HEAD, TOGETHER WITH OTHER TRIVIAL MATTERS WHICH CANNOT BE
<p/>LEFT UNTOLD Don Quixote's host was one Don Antonio Moreno by name, a gentleman of wealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any fair and good-natured way; and having Don Quixote in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) house he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) set about devising modes of making him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mad points in some harmless fashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport is worth anything if it hurts another.
<p/>The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did was to make Don Quixote take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour, and lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), in that tight chamois suit we have already described and depicted more than once, out on a balcony overhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of the crowd and of the boys, who gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) as they would at a monkey.
<p/>The cavaliers in livery careered before him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) again as though it were for him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) alone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it, and Sancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had fallen upon another Camacho's wedding, another house like Don Diego de Miranda's, another castle like the duke's.
<p/>Some of Don Antonio's friends dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) that day, and all showed honour to Don Quixote and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) as a knight-errant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) becoming puffed up and exalted in consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction.
<p/>Such were the drolleries of Sancho that all the servants of the house, and all who heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), were kept hanging upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lips.
<p/>While at table Don Antonio said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``We hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fond of manjar blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you keep them in your bosom for the next day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, senor, that's not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``for I am more cleanly than greedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows well that we two are used to live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts.
<p/>To be sure, if it so happens that they offer me a heifer, I run with a halter; I mean, I eat what I'm given, and make use of opportunities as I find them; but whoever says that I'm an out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let me tell him (<font color='blue'><b>eater</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>eater</b></font>) is wrong; and I'd put it in a different way if I did not respect the honourable beards that are at the table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``Sancho's moderation and cleanliness in eating might be inscribed and graved on plates of brass, to be kept in eternal remembrance in ages to come.
<p/>It is true that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is hungry there is a certain appearance of voracity about him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eats at a great pace and chews with both jaws; but cleanliness he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) is always mindful of; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was governor he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) learned how to eat daintily, so much so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork.
<p/>I governed it to perfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; and learned to look down upon all the governments in the world; I got out of it by taking to flight, and fell into a pit where I gave myself up for dead, and out of which I escaped alive by a miracle.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>said Don Antonio, <div class="bookquote">``has Sancho been a governor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``and of an island called Barataria. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Don Quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair of Sancho's government, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) greatly amused his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hearers.
<p/>On the cloth being removed Don Antonio, taking Don Quixote by the hand, passed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) into a distant room in which there was nothing in the way of furniture except a table, apparently of jasper, resting on a pedestal of the same, upon which was set up, after the fashion of the busts of the Roman emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze.
<p/>Don Antonio traversed the whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked round the table several times, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Senor Don Quixote, that I am satisfied that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, I will tell you of one of the rarest adventures, or more properly speaking strange things, that can be imagined, on condition that you will keep what I say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I swear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and for greater security I will put a flag-stone over it; for I would have you know, Senor Don Antonio
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) had by this time learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) name-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``that you are addressing one who, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) has ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may safely transfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely upon it that you have consigned it to the depths of silence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In reliance upon that promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>said Don Antonio, ``I will astonish you with what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself of some of the vexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets, for they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody.
<p/>Don Quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of such precautions; whereupon Don Antonio taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) hand passed it over the bronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it stood, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``This head, Senor Don Quixote, has been made and fabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever saw, a Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotillo of whom such marvellous stories are told.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) was here in my house, and for a consideration of a thousand crowns that I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) constructed this head, which has the property and virtue of answering whatever questions are put to its ear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) observed the points of the compass, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) traced figures, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) studied the stars, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) watched favourable moments, and at length brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, for on Fridays
<p/>In the interval your worship may consider what you would like to ask it; and I know by experience that in all its answers it tells the truth.
<p/>Don Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and was inclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) had to wait to test the matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) did not choose to say anything except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) for having revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) so mighty a secret.
<p/>They then quitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and they repaired to the chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>it is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the next day. '' In the meantime Sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and accidents that had happened his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master.
<p/>That afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), that at that season would have made ice itself sweat.
<p/>Orders were left with the servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) leave the house. Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace and handsomely caparisoned.
<p/>They put the surcoat on him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and on the back, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote in large letters, ``This is Don Quixote of La Mancha.
<p/>As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and as they read out, <div class="bookquote">``This is Don Quixote of La Mancha,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), called him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) name, and recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and turning to Don Antonio, who rode at his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) observed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Great are the privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) who professes it known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, Senor Don Quixote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>returned Don Antonio; ``for as fire cannot be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above all others.
<p/>It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the acclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the inscription on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back, cried out in a loud voice, <div class="bookquote">``The devil take thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha!
<p/>Thou art mad; and if thou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it would not be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of all who have anything to do with thee or say to thee.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' What! art thou here, and not dead of the countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Why, look at these gentlemen bearing thee company!
<p/>Get thee home, blockhead, and see after thy affairs, and thy wife and children, and give over these fooleries that are sapping thy brains and skimming away thy wits.''
<p/>Senor Don Quixote is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) full senses, and we who bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) company are not fools; virtue is to be honoured wherever it may be found; go, and bad luck to you, and don't meddle where you are not wanted.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By God, your worship is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div>replied the Castilian; ``for to advise this good man is to kick against the pricks; still for all that it fills me with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead has in everything should dribble away by the channel of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knight-errantry; but may the bad luck your worship talks of follow me and all my descendants, if, from this day forth, though I should live longer than Methuselah, I ever give advice to anybody even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks me for it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go your own way, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>said Don Antonio, <div class="bookquote">``and don't offer advice to those who don't ask you for it. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div><p/>The advice-giver took himself off, and they continued their stroll; but so great was the press of the boys and people to read the placard, that Don Antonio was forced to remove it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) were taking off something else.
<p/>Night came and they went home, and there was a ladies' dancing party, for Don Antonio's wife, a lady of rank and gaiety, beauty and wit, had invited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) guest and amuse themselves with his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) strange delusions.
<p/>Among the ladies were two of a mischievous and frolicsome turn, and, though perfectly modest, somewhat free in playing tricks for harmless diversion's sake.
<p/>These two were so indefatigable in taking Don Quixote out to dance that they tired him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) down, not only in body but in spirit.
<p/>It was a sight to see the figure Don Quixote made, long, lank, lean, and yellow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) garments clinging tight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ungainly, and above all anything but agile.
<p/>The gay ladies made secret love to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) part secretly repelled them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) voice and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Fugite, partes adversae!
<p/>Leave me in peace, unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) who is queen of mine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffers none but hers to lead me captive and subdue me;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sat down on the floor in the middle of the room, tired out and broken down by all this exertion in the dance.
<p/>Don Antonio directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) to be taken up bodily and carried to bed, and the first that laid hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) was Sancho, saying as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did so, <div class="bookquote">``In an evil hour you took to dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty men of valour are dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering?
<p/>Several of them came, they supped sumptuously, the dance began at about ten o'clock. If you do, I can tell you you are mistaken; there's
<p/>many a man would rather undertake to kill a giant than cut a caper. If it had been the shoe-fling you were at
<p/>I could take your place, for I can do the shoe-fling like a gerfalcon; but I'm no good at dancing. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sancho set the whole ball-room laughing, and then put his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master to bed, covering him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) up well so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might sweat out any chill caught after his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) dancing.
<p/>The next day Don Antonio thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) might as well make trial of the enchanted head, and with Don Quixote, Sancho, and two others, friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), besides the two ladies that had tired out Don Quixote at the ball, who had remained for the night with Don Antonio's wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) locked himself up in the chamber where the head was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) explained to them the property it possessed and entrusted the secret to them, telling them that now for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) was going to try the virtue of the enchanted head; but except Don Antonio's two friends no one else was privy to the mystery of the enchantment, and if Don Antonio had not first revealed it to them they would have been inevitably reduced to the same state of amazement as the rest, so artfully and skilfully was it contrived.
<p/>The first to approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, and in a low voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) said to it, <div class="bookquote">``Head, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at this moment thinking of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The head, without any movement of the lips, answered in a clear and distinct voice, so as to be heard by all, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot judge of thoughts.
<p/>All were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw that there was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that could have answered.
<p/>How many of us are here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>asked Don Antonio once more; and it was answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) in the same way softly, ``Thou and thy wife, with two friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha, and a squire of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), Sancho Panza by name.
<p/>Now there was fresh astonishment; now everyone's hair was standing on end with awe; and Don Antonio retiring from the head exclaimed,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This suffices to show me that I have not been deceived by him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) who sold thee to me, O sage head, talking head, answering head, wonderful head!
<p/>With these and other observations ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>'' '' Let some one else go and put what question he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) likes to it.
<p/>And as women are commonly impulsive and inquisitive, the first to come forward was one of the two friends of Don Antonio's wife, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) question was, <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Head, what shall I do to be very beautiful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Antonio wife</b></font>)</div>and the answer she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) got was, <div class="bookquote">``Be very modest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) companion then came up and said, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know, Head, whether my husband loves me or not;''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>the answer given to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was, <div class="bookquote">``Think how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) uses thee, and thou mayest guess;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and the married lady went off saying, <div class="bookquote">``That answer did not need a question; for of course the treatment one receives shows the disposition of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) from whom it is received.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I question thee no further,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the fair querist. '' Then one of Don Antonio's two friends advanced and asked it, <div class="bookquote">``Who am I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Antonio friends</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Thou knowest,'' was the answer. '' That is not what I ask thee,'' said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``but to tell me if thou knowest me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know thee, thou art Don Pedro Noriz,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was the reply. '' I do not seek to know more,'' said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``for this is enough to convince me,
<p/>O Head, that thou knowest everything;''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) retired the other friend came forward and asked it, <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Head, what are the wishes of my eldest son?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said already,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer, <div class="bookquote">``that I cannot judge of wishes; however, I can tell thee the wish of thy son is to bury thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That's `what I see with my eyes I point out with my finger,''' said the gentleman, ``so I ask no more.
<p/>Don Antonio's wife came up and said, <div class="bookquote">``I know not what to ask thee, Head; I would only seek to know of thee if I shall have many years of enjoyment of my good husband;''  (<font color='red'><b>Antonio wife</b></font>)</div>and the answer she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) received was, ``Thou shalt, for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) vigour and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) temperate habits promise many years of life, which by their intemperance others so often cut short.
<p/>Then Don Quixote came forward and said, <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, thou that answerest, was that which I describe as having happened to me in the cave of Montesinos the truth or a dream?
<p/>As to the question of the cave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>was the reply, <div class="bookquote">``there is much to be said; there is something of both in it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho</b></font>)</div>'' Will Sancho's whipping be accomplished without fail? Will the disenchantment of Dulcinea be brought about? '' '' Sancho's whipping will proceed leisurely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I seek to know no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``let me but see Dulcinea disenchanted, and I will consider that all the good fortune I could wish for has come upon me all at once.
<p/>The disenchantment of Dulcinea will attain its due consummation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' The last questioner was Sancho, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) questions were, ``Head, shall I by any chance have another government?
<p/>Shall I ever escape from the hard life of a squire? Shall I get back to see my wife and children?
<p/>To which the answer came, <div class="bookquote">``Thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thou returnest to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing to serve thou shalt cease to be a squire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Good, by God!'' said Sancho Panza; <div class="bookquote">``I could have told myself that; the prophet Perogrullo could have said no more.
<p/>What answer wouldst thou have, beast?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``is it not enough that the replies this head has given suit the questions put to it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' Yes, it is enough,'' said Sancho; ``but I should have liked it to have made itself plainer and told me more.
<p/>The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with which all were filled, except Don Antonio's two friends who were in the secret.
<p/>This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, not to keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strange magical mystery in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) says, therefore, that on the model of another head, the work of an image maker, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) had seen at Madrid, Don Antonio made this one at home for his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) own amusement and to astonish ignorant people; and its mechanism was as follows.
<p/>The table was of wood painted and varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal on which it stood was of the same material, with four eagles' claws projecting from it to support the weight more steadily.
<p/>The head, which resembled a bust or figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured like bronze, was hollow throughout, as was the table, into which it was fitted so exactly that no trace of the joining was visible.
<p/>The pedestal of the table was also hollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the head, and the whole was in communication with another room underneath the chamber in which the head stood.
<p/>Through the entire cavity in the pedestal, table, throat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed a tube of tin carefully adjusted and concealed from sight.
<p/>In the room below corresponding to the one above was placed the person who was to answer, with his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) mouth to the tube, and the voice, as in an ear-trumpet, passed from above downwards, and from below upwards, the words coming clearly and distinctly; it was impossible, thus, to detect the trick.
<p/>A nephew of Don Antonio's, a smart sharp-witted student, was the answerer, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) had been told beforehand by his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) uncle who the persons were that would come with him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) that day into the chamber where the head was, it was an easy matter for him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) to answer the first question at once and correctly; the others he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) answered by guess-work, and, being clever, cleverly.
<p/>Cide Hamete adds that this marvellous contrivance stood for some ten or twelve days; but that, as it became noised abroad through the city that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) house an enchanted head that answered all who asked questions of it, Don Antonio, fearing it might come to the ears of the watchful sentinels of our faith, explained the matter to the inquisitors, who commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) to break it up and have done with it, lest the ignorant vulgar should be scandalised.
<p/>the head was still held to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering questions, though more to Don Quixote's satisfaction than Sancho's.
<p/>The gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don Antonio and also to do the honours to Don Quixote, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) an opportunity of displaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) folly, made arrangements for a tilting at the ring in six days from that time, which, however, for reason that will be mentioned hereafter, did not take place.
<p/>Don Quixote took a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feared that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went on horseback the boys would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) set out for a walk.
<p/>Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets Don Quixote lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) eyes and saw written in very large letters over a door, <div class="bookquote">``Books printed here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was vastly pleased, for until then he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had never seen a printing office, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was curious to know what it was like.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) entered with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) following, and saw them drawing sheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type here, revising there; in short all the work that is to be seen in great printing offices.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went up to one case and asked what they were about there; the workmen told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) watched them with wonder, and passed on.
<p/>'' By Don Quixote, however, and by Sancho He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) approached one man, among others, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>The workman replied, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, this gentleman here''  (<font color='red'><b>The workman</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to a man of prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``has translated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am setting it up in type for the press.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>What is the title of the book?'' asked Don Quixote; to which the author replied, <div class="bookquote">``Senor, in Italian the book is called Le Bagatelle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div><p/>Le Bagatelle,'' said the author, ``is as though we should say in Spanish Los Juguetes; but though the book is humble in name it has good solid matter in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``have some little smattering of Italian, and I plume myself on singing some of Ariosto's stanzas; but tell me, senor--I do not say this to test your ability, but merely out of curiosity--have you ever met with the word pignatta in your book?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' And what does Le Bagatelle import in our Spanish?'' asked Don Quixote. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, often,''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>said the author.
<p/>'' And how do you render that in Spanish?'' <div class="bookquote">``How should I render it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>returned the author, <div class="bookquote">``but by olla?''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Body o' me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``what a proficient you are in the Italian language!
<p/>I would lay a good wager that where they say in Italian piace you say in Spanish place, and where they say piu you say mas, and you translate su by arriba and giu by abajo.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would venture to swear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``that your worship is not known in the world, which always begrudges their reward to rare wits and praiseworthy labours.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I translate them so of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>said the author, <div class="bookquote">``for those are their proper equivalents. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>What talents lie wasted there!
<p/>Still it seems to me that translation from one language into another, if it be not from the queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking at Flemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are visible, they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they do not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side; and translation from easy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command of words, any more than transcribing or copying out one document from another.
<p/>But I do not mean by this to draw the inference that no credit is to be allowed for the work of translating, for a man may employ himself in ways worse and less profitable to himself.
<p/>This estimate does not include two famous translators, Doctor Cristobal de Figueroa, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Figueroa</b></font>) Pastor Fido, and Don Juan de Jauregui, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) Aminta, wherein by their felicity they leave it in doubt which is the translation and which the original.
<p/>But tell me, are you printing this book at your own risk, or have you sold the <div class="bookquote">``I print at my own risk,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said the author, ``and I expect to make a thousand ducats at least by this first edition, which is to be of two thousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six reals apiece.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fine calculation you are making!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``it is plain you don't know the ins and outs of the printers, and how they play into one another's hands.
<p/>I promise you when you find yourself saddled with two thousand copies you will feel so sore that it will astonish you, particularly if the book is a little out of the common and not in any way highly spiced.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>What genius thrust away into corners! What worth left neglected! '' <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>said the author, ``would your worship, then, have me give it to a is doing me a favour?
<p/>I do not print my books to win fame in the world, for I am known in it already by my works; I want to make money, without which reputation is not worth a rap.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God send your worship good luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) moved on to another case, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw them correcting a sheet of a book with the title of <div class="bookquote">``Light of the Soul;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>noticing it he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) observed, ``Books like this, though there are many of the kind, are the ones that deserve to be printed, for many are the sinners in these days, and lights unnumbered are needed for all that are in darkness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) passed on, and saw they were also correcting another book, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked its title they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) it was called, <div class="bookquote">``The Second Part of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>by one of Tordesillas.
<p/>I have heard of this book already,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and verily and on my conscience I thought it had been by this time burned to ashes as a meddlesome intruder; but its Martinmas will come to it as it does to every pig; for fictions have the more merit and charm about them the more nearly they approach the truth or what looks like it; and true stories, the truer they are the better they are;''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>and so saying he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) walked out of the printing office with a certain amount of displeasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>) looks.
<p/>That same day Don Antonio arranged to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) to see the galleys that lay at the beach, whereat Sancho was in high delight, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had never seen any all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) life.
<p/>Don Antonio sent word to the commandant of the galleys that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) intended to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) guest, the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, of whom the commandant and all the citizens had already heard, that afternoon to see them; and what happened on board of them will be told in the next chapter.
<p/>THROUGH THE VISIT TO THE GALLEYS, AND THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF THE FAIR MORISCO Profound were Don Quixote's reflections on the reply of the enchanted head, not one of them, however, hitting on the secret of the trick, but all concentrated on the promise, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) regarded as a certainty, of Dulcinea's disenchantment.
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) turned over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mind again and again with great satisfaction, fully persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would shortly see its fulfillment; and as for Sancho, though, as has been said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hated being a governor, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had a longing to be giving orders and finding himself obeyed once more; this is the misfortune that being in authority, even in jest, brings with it.
<p/>To resume; that afternoon their host Don Antonio Moreno and his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>) two friends, with Don Quixote and Sancho, went to the galleys.
<p/>The commandant had been already made aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>commandant</b></font>) good fortune in seeing two such famous persons as Don Quixote and Sancho, and the instant they came to the shore all the galleys struck their awnings and the clarions rang out.
<p/>A skiff covered with rich carpets and cushions of crimson velvet was immediately lowered into the water, and as Don Quixote stepped on board of it, the leading galley fired her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gangway gun, and the other galleys did the same; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mounted the starboard ladder the whole crew saluted him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) -LRB-as is the custom when a personage of distinction comes on board a galley-RRB- by exclaiming <div class="bookquote">``Hu, hu, hu,''  (<font color='red'><b>a personage</b></font>)</div>three times.
<p/>The general, for so we shall call him (<font color='blue'><b>Hu</b></font>), a Valencian gentleman of rank, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hu</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hu</b></font>) hand and embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Hu</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``I shall mark this day with a white stone as one of the happiest I can expect to enjoy in my lifetime, since I have seen Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, pattern and image wherein we see contained and condensed all that is worthy in knight-errantry.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' CHAPTER LXIII. OF THE MISHAP THAT BEFELL SANCHO PANZA '' Don Quixote delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception, replied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in words no less courteous.
<p/>All then proceeded to the poop, which was very handsomely decorated, and seated themselves on the bulwark benches; the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all hands to strip, which they did in an instant.
<p/>Sancho, seeing such a number of men stripped to the skin, was taken aback, and still more when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw them spread the awning so briskly that it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) as if all the devils were at work at it; but all this was cakes and fancy bread to what I am going to tell now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), previously instructed in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was to do, laid hold of Sancho, hoisting him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arms, and the whole crew, who were standing ready, beginning on the right, proceeded to pass him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on, whirling him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) along from hand to hand and from bench to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poor Sancho's eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) made quite sure that the devils themselves were flying away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); nor did they leave off with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) until they had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) back along the left side and deposited him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) on the poop; and the poor fellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat, and unable to comprehend what it was that had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>Don Quixote when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw Sancho's flight without wings asked the general if this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board the galleys for the first time; for, if so, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had no intention of adopting them as a profession, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had no mind to perform such feats of agility, and if anyone offered to lay hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to whirl him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) vowed to God he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would kick his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) soul out; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said this he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stood up and clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sword.
<p/>Sancho was seated on the captain's stage, close to the aftermost rower on the right-hand side. At this instant they struck the awning and lowered the yard with a prodigious rattle.
<p/>Sancho thought heaven was coming off its hinges and going to fall on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head, and full of terror he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ducked it and buried it between his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees; nor were Don Quixote's knees altogether under control, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) too shook a little, squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shoulders together and lost colour.
<p/>The crew then hoisted the yard with the same rapidity and clatter as when they lowered it, all the while keeping silence as though they had neither voice nor breath.
<p/>The boatswain gave the signal to weigh anchor, and leaping upon the middle of the gangway began to lay on to the shoulders of the crew with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) courbash or whip, and to haul out gradually to sea.
<p/>When Sancho saw so many red feet -LRB-for such he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) took the oars to be-RRB- moving all together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to himself, ``It's these that are the real chanted things, and not the ones
<p/>What can those wretches have done to be so whipped; and how does that one man who goes along there whistling dare to whip
<p/>Don Quixote, observing how attentively Sancho regarded what was going on, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Sancho my friend, how quickly and cheaply might you finish off the disenchantment of Dulcinea, if you would strip to the waist and take your place among those gentlemen!
<p/>my master talks of. so many? I declare this is hell, or at least purgatory! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Amid the pain and sufferings of so many you would not feel your own much; and moreover perhaps the sage
<p/>Merlin would allow each of these lashes, being laid on with a good hand, to count for ten of those which you must give yourself at last.
<p/>The general was about to ask what these lashes were, and what was Dulcinea's disenchantment, when a sailor exclaimed, ``Monjui signals that there is an oared vessel off the coast to the west.
<p/>On hearing this the general sprang upon the gangway crying, <div class="bookquote">``Now then, my sons, don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) give us the slip!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It must be some Algerine corsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us. '' The three others immediately came alongside the chief galley to receive their orders.
<p/>The general ordered two to put out to sea while he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) with the other kept in shore, so that in this way the vessel could not escape them.
<p/>The two that had put out to sea, after a couple of miles sighted a vessel which, so far as they could make out, they judged to be one of fourteen or fifteen banks, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) proved.
<p/>As soon as the vessel discovered the galleys she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) went about with the object and in the hope of making her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) escape by her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) speed; but the attempt failed, for the chief galley was one of the fastest vessels afloat, and overhauled her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) so rapidly that they on board
<p/>the brigantine saw clearly there was no possibility of escaping, and the rais therefore would have had them drop their oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captain in command of our galleys to anger.
<p/>But chance, directing things otherwise, so ordered it that just as the chief galley came close enough for those on board the vessel to hear the shouts from her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) calling on them to surrender, two Toraquis, that is to say two Turks, both drunken, that with a dozen more were on board the brigantine, discharged their muskets, killing two of the soldiers that lined the sides of our vessel.
<p/>Seeing this the general swore he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) would not leave one of those he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) found on board the vessel alive, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) bore down furiously upon her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) slipped away from him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) underneath the oars.
<p/>The galley shot a good way ahead; those on board the vessel saw their case was desperate, and while the galley was coming about they made sail, and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off; but their activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm, for the galley coming up with them in
<p/>The crews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously that they seemed to fly. a little more than half a mile threw her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) oars over them and took the whole of them alive.
<p/>The other two galleys now joined company and all four returned with the prize to the beach, where a vast multitude stood waiting for them, eager to see what they brought back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>crews</b></font>) ordered the skiff to push off to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>crews</b></font>), and the yard to be lowered for the purpose of hanging forthwith the rais and the rest of the men taken on board the vessel, about six-and-thirty in number, all smart fellows and most of them Turkish musketeers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>crews</b></font>) asked which was the rais of the brigantine, and was answered in Spanish by one of the prisoners -LRB-who afterwards proved to be a Spanish renegade-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``This young man, senor that you see here is our rais,''  (<font color='red'><b>a renegade rais</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed to one of the handsomest and most gallant-looking youths that could be imagined.
<p/>The general anchored close in, and perceived that the viceroy of the city was on the shore. He (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) did not seem to be twenty years of age.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the general, <div class="bookquote">``what led thee to kill my soldiers, when thou sawest it was impossible for thee to escape?
<p/>Is that the way to behave to chief galleys? Knowest thou not that rashness is not valour? Faint prospects of success should make men bold, but not rash.
<p/>The rais was about to reply, but the general could not at that moment listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) had to hasten to receive the viceroy, who was now coming on board the galley, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) attendants and some of the people.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the viceroy</b></font>)</div>'' You have had a good chase, senor general,'' said the viceroy. '' Your excellency shall soon see how good, by the game strung up to this yard,'' replied the general.
<p/>Because,'' said the general, <div class="bookquote">``against all law, reason, and usages of war they have killed on my hands two of the best soldiers on board these galleys, and I have sworn to hang every man that I have taken, but above all this youth who is the rais of the brigantine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands already bound and the rope round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck, ready for death.
<p/>The viceroy looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>), and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) so well-favoured, so graceful, and so submissive, he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) felt a desire to spare his (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) life, the comeliness of the youth furnishing him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) at once with a letter of recommendation.
<p/>'' How so?'' returned the viceroy. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) therefore questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, rais, art thou Turk, Moor, or renegade?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>To which the youth replied, also in Spanish, <div class="bookquote">``I am neither Turk, nor Moor, nor renegade. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth Turk renegade</b></font>)</div>'' What art thou, then?'' said the viceroy.
<p/>'' A Christian woman,'' replied the youth. '' A woman and a Christian, in such a dress and in such circumstances!
<p/>Suspend the execution of the sentence,'' said the youth; <div class="bookquote">``your vengeance will not lose much by waiting while I tell you the story of my life.
<p/>What heart could be so hard as not to be softened by these words, at any rate so far as to listen to what the unhappy youth had to say?
<p/>It is more marvellous than credible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>said the viceroy. '' '' The general bade him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) say what he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) pleased, but not to expect pardon for his (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) flagrant offence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Born of Morisco parents, I am of that nation, more unhappy than wise, upon which of late a sea of woes has poured down.
<p/>In the course of our misfortune I was carried to Barbary by two uncles of mine, for it was in vain that I declared I was a Christian, as in fact I am, and not a mere pretended one, or outwardly, but a true Catholic Christian.
<p/>It availed me nothing with those charged with our sad expatriation to protest this, nor would my uncles believe it; on the contrary, they treated it as an untruth and a subterfuge set up to enable me to remain behind in the land of my birth; and so, more by force than of my own will, they took me with them.
<p/>I had a Christian mother, and a father who was a man of sound sense and a Christian too; I imbibed the Catholic faith with my mother's milk,
<p/>With this permission the youth began in these words. I was well brought up, and neither in word nor in deed did I, I think, show any sign of being a Morisco.
<p/>To accompany these virtues, for such I hold them, my beauty, if I possess any, grew with my growth; and great as was the seclusion in which I lived it was not so great
<p/>but that a young gentleman, Don Gaspar Gregorio by name, eldest son of a gentleman who is lord of a village near ours, contrived to find opportunities of seeing me.
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) saw me, how we met, how his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) heart was lost to me, and mine not kept from him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), would take too long to tell, especially at a moment when I am in dread of the cruel cord that threatens me interposing between tongue and throat; I will only say, therefore, that Don Gregorio chose to accompany me in our banishment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) joined company with the Moriscoes who were going forth from other villages, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) knew their language very well, and on the voyage he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) struck up a friendship with my two uncles who were carrying me with them; for my father, like a wise and far-sighted man, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard the first edict for our expulsion, quitted the village and departed in quest of some refuge for us abroad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left hidden and buried, at a spot of which I alone have knowledge, a large quantity of pearls and precious stones of great value, together with a sum of money in gold cruzadoes and doubloons.
<p/>I obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and with my uncles, as I have said, and others of our kindred and neighbours, passed over to Barbary, and the place where we took up our abode was Algiers, much the same as if we had taken it up in hell itself.
<p/>The king heard of my beauty, and report told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) of my wealth, which was in some degree fortunate for me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) summoned me before him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and asked me what part of Spain I came from, and what money and jewels I had.
<p/>I mentioned the place, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) the jewels and money were buried there; but that they might easily be recovered if I myself went back for them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) charged me on no account to touch the treasure, if by any chance they expelled us before his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) return. All this I told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), in dread lest my beauty and not his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own covetousness should influence him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was engaged in conversation with me, they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) word that in company with me was one of the handsomest and most graceful youths that could be imagined.
<p/>I was troubled when I thought of the danger he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was in, for among those barbarous Turks a fair youth is more esteemed than a woman, be she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ever so beautiful.
<p/>The king immediately ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to be brought before him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might see him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and asked me if what they said about the youth was true.
<p/>I then, almost as if inspired by heaven, told him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) it was, but that I would have him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to know it was not a man, but a woman like myself, and I entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to allow me to go and dress her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the attire proper to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), so that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty might be seen to perfection, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might present herself before him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) with less embarrassment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bade me go by all means, and said that the next day we should discuss the plan to be adopted for my return to Spain to carry away the hidden treasure.
<p/>I knew at once that they were speaking of Don Gaspar Gregorio, whose comeliness surpasses the most highly vaunted beauty. I saw Don Gaspar, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspar</b></font>) the danger he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspar</b></font>) was in
<p/>if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspar</b></font>) let it be seen he (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspar</b></font>) was a man, I dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspar</b></font>) as a Moorish woman, and that same afternoon I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gaspar</b></font>) before the king, who was charmed when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and resolved to keep the damsel and make a present of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) to the Grand Signor; and to avoid the risk she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) might run among the women of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) seraglio, and distrustful of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) to be placed in the house of some Moorish ladies of rank who would protect and attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>); and thither he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) was taken at once.
<p/>What we both suffered -LRB-for I cannot deny that I love him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)-RRB- may be left to the imagination of those who are separated if they love one another dearly.
<p/>The king then arranged that I should return to Spain in this brigantine, and that two Turks, those who killed your soldiers, should accompany me.
<p/>There also came with me this Spanish renegade'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and here she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) pointed to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) who had first spoken--<div class="bookquote">``whom I know to be secretly a Christian, and to be more desirous of being left in Spain than of returning to Barbary.
<p/>The two Turks, greedy and insolent, instead of obeying the orders we had to land me and this renegade in Christian dress -LRB-with which we came provided-RRB- on the first Spanish ground we came to, chose to run along the coast and make some prize if they could, fearing that if they put us ashore first, we might, in case of some accident befalling us, make it known that the brigantine was at sea, and thus, if there happened to be any galleys on the coast, they might be taken.
<p/>We sighted this shore last night, and knowing nothing of these galleys, we were discovered, and the result was what you have seen.
<p/>To sum up, there is Don Gregorio in woman's dress, among women, in imminent danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) life; and here am I, with hands bound, in expectation, or rather in dread, of losing my life, of which I am already weary.
<p/>Here, sirs, ends my sad story, as true as it is unhappy; all I ask of you is to allow me to die like a Christian, for, as I have already said, I am not to be charged with the offence of which those of my nation are guilty;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood silent, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes filled with moving tears, accompanied by plenty from the bystanders.
<p/>The viceroy, touched with compassion, went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) without speaking and untied the cord that bound the hands of the Moorish girl.
<p/>But all the while the Morisco Christian was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strange story, an elderly pilgrim, who had come on board of the galley at the same time as the viceroy, kept his (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and the instant she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ceased speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) threw himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet, and embracing them said in a voice broken by sobs and sighs, <div class="bookquote">``O Ana Felix, my unhappy daughter, I am thy father Ricote, come back to look for thee, unable to live without thee, my soul that thou art!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), Sancho opened his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been holding down, brooding over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unlucky excursion; and looking at the pilgrim he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) recognised in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that same Ricote he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) met the day he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) government, and felt satisfied that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) being now unbound embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, mingling her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tears with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) addressing the general and the viceroy said, ``This, sirs, is my daughter, more unhappy in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) adventures than in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) name.
<p/>The rest of the crew of the brigantine are Moors and Turks, who merely serve as rowers. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is Ana Felix, surnamed Ricote, celebrated as much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) own beauty as for my wealth.
<p/>I quitted my native land in search of some shelter or refuge for us abroad, and having found one in Germany
<p/>I returned in this pilgrim's dress, in the company of some other German pilgrims, to seek my daughter and take up a large quantity of treasure I had left buried.
<p/>My daughter I did not find, the treasure I found and have with me; and now, in this strange roundabout way you have seen, I find the treasure that more than all makes me rich, my beloved daughter.
<p/>If our innocence and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tears and mine can with strict justice open the door to clemency, extend it to us, for we never had any intention of injuring you, nor do we sympathise with the aims of our people, who have been justly banished.
<p/>I know too that what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says about Ana Felix being his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) daughter is true; but as to those other particulars about going and coming, and having good or bad intentions, I say nothing.
<p/>While all present stood amazed at this strange occurrence the general said, <div class="bookquote">``At any rate your tears will not allow me to keep my oath; live, fair Ana Felix, all the years that heaven has allotted you; but these rash insolent fellows must pay the penalty of the crime they have committed;''  (<font color='red'><b>the general</b></font>)</div>and with that he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) gave orders to have the two Turks who had killed his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) two soldiers hanged at once at the yard-arm.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I know Ricote well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho at this, <div class="bookquote">``and ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>The viceroy, however, begged him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) earnestly not to hang them, as their behaviour savoured rather of madness than of bravado.
<p/>They then tried to devise some scheme for rescuing Don Gaspar Gregorio from the danger in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) had been left.
<p/>Ricote offered for that object more than two thousand ducats that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) had in pearls and gems; they proposed several plans, but none so good as that suggested by the renegade already mentioned, who offered to return to Algiers in a small vessel of about six banks, manned by Christian rowers, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) knew where, how, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could and should land, nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) ignorant of the house in which Don Gaspar was staying.
<p/>The general and the viceroy had some hesitation about placing confidence in the renegade and entrusting him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) with the Christians who were to row, but Ana Felix said she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) could answer for him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father offered to go and pay the ransom of the Christians if by any chance they should not be forthcoming.
<p/>This, then, being agreed upon, the viceroy landed, and Don Antonio Moreno took the fair Morisco and her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>), the viceroy charging him (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>) to give them the best reception and welcome in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>) power, while on his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>) own part he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>) offered all that house contained for their entertainment; so great was the good-will and kindliness the beauty of Ana Felix had infused into his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>) heart.
<p/>The general yielded to the viceroy's request, for revenge is not easily taken in cold blood. CHAPTER LXIV. TREATING OF THE ADVENTURE WHICH GAVE
<p/>DON QUIXOTE MORE UNHAPPINESS THAN ALL THAT HAD HITHERTO BEFALLEN HIM The wife of Don Antonio Moreno, so the history says, was extremely happy to see Ana Felix in her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) welcomed her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) with great kindness, charmed as well by her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) beauty as by her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) intelligence; for in both respects the fair Morisco was richly endowed, and all the people of the city flocked to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) as though they had been summoned by the ringing of the bells.
<p/>Don Quixote told Don Antonio that the plan adopted for releasing Don Gregorio was not a good one, for its risks were greater than its advantages, and that it would be better to land himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) arms and horse in Barbary; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) would carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) off in spite of the whole Moorish host, as Don Gaiferos carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) wife Melisendra.
<p/>Remember, your worship,'' observed Sancho on hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) say so, <div class="bookquote">``Senor Don Gaiferos carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaiferos</b></font>) wife from the mainland, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to France by land; but in this case, if by chance we carry off Don Gregorio, we have no way of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) to Spain, for there's the sea between.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>There's a remedy for everything except death,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``if they bring the vessel close to the shore we shall be able to get on board though all the world strive to prevent us.
<p/>Your worship hits it off mighty well and mighty easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``but `it's a long step from saying to doing;' and I hold to the renegade, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seems to me an honest good-hearted fellow.
<p/>Don Antonio then said that if the renegade did not prove successful, the expedient of the great Don Quixote's expedition to Barbary should be adopted.
<p/>Two days afterwards the renegade put to sea in a light vessel of six oars a-side manned by a stout crew, and two days later the galleys made sail eastward, the general having begged the viceroy to let him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) know all about the release of Don Gregorio and about Ana Felix, and the viceroy promised to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) requested.
<p/>One morning as Don Quixote went out for a stroll along the beach, arrayed in full armour -LRB-for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) often said, that was <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) only gear, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) only rest the fray,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) never was without it for a moment-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw coming towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) a knight, also in full armour, with a shining moon painted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shield, who, on approaching sufficiently near to be heard, said in a loud voice, addressing himself to Don Quixote, ``Illustrious knight, and never sufficiently extolled Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am the Knight of the White Moon, whose unheard-of achievements will perhaps have recalled him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) to thy memory.
<p/>I come to do battle with thee and prove the might of thy arm, to the end that I make thee acknowledge and confess that my lady, let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) be who she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may, is incomparably fairer than thy Dulcinea del Toboso.
<p/>If thou dost acknowledge this fairly and openly, thou shalt escape death and save me the trouble of inflicting it upon thee; if thou fightest
<p/>and I vanquish thee, I demand no other satisfaction than that, laying aside arms and abstaining from going in quest of adventures, thou withdraw and betake thyself to thine own village for the space of a year, and live there without putting hand to sword, in peace and quiet and beneficial repose, the same being needful for the increase of thy substance and the salvation of thy soul; and if thou dost vanquish me, my head shall be at thy disposal, my arms and horse thy spoils, and the renown of my deeds transferred and added to thine.
<p/>Consider which will be thy best course, and give me thy answer speedily, for this day is all the time I have for the despatch of this business.
<p/>Don Quixote was amazed and astonished, as well at the Knight of the White Moon's arrogance, as at his (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) reason for delivering the defiance, and with calm dignity he (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Knight of the White Moon, of whose achievements I have never heard until now, I will venture to swear you have never seen the illustrious Dulcinea
<p/>I know you would have taken care not to venture yourself upon this issue, because the sight would have removed all doubt from your mind that there ever has been or can be a beauty to be compared with hers; and so, not saying you lie, but merely that you are not correct in what you state, I accept your challenge, with the conditions you have proposed, and at once, that the day you have fixed may not expire; and from your conditions I except only that of the renown of your achievements being transferred to me, for I know not of what sort they are nor what they may amount to; I am satisfied with my own, such as they be.
<p/>Take, therefore, the side of the field you choose, and I will do the same; and to whom God shall give it may
<p/>The Knight of the White Moon had been seen from the city, and it was told the viceroy how he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) was in conversation with Don Quixote.
<p/>The viceroy, fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by Don Antonio Moreno or some other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the beach accompanied by Don Antonio and several other gentlemen, just as Don Quixote was wheeling Rocinante round in order to take up the necessary distance.
<p/>The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them were evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them, asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a sudden in this way.
<p/>The Knight of the White Moon replied that it was a question of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) had said to Don Quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sides had been accepted.
<p/>The viceroy went over to Don Antonio, and asked in a low voice did he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) know who the Knight of the White Moon was, or was it some joke they were playing on Don Quixote.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' '' ; for had you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) Saint Peter add his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) blessing. '' Don Antonio replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) neither knew who he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) was nor whether the defiance was in joke or in earnest.
<p/>This answer left the viceroy in a state of perplexity, not knowing whether he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) ought to let the combat go on or not; but unable to persuade himself that it was anything but a joke he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) fell back, saying, ``If there be no other way out of it, gallant knights, except to confess or die, and Don Quixote is inflexible, and your worship of the White Moon still more so, in God's hand be it, and fall on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) of the White Moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosen words for the permission he (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) gave them, and so did Don Quixote, who then, commending himself with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heart to heaven and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) Dulcinea, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), proceeded to take a little more distance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) antagonist was doing the same; then, without blast of trumpet or other warlike instrument to give them the signal to charge, both at the same instant wheeled their horses; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of the White Moon, being the swifter, met Don Quixote after having traversed two-thirds of the course, and there encountered him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with such violence that, without touching him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lance -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) held it high, to all appearance purposely-RRB-
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sprang upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) at once, and placing the lance over his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) visor said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), ``You are vanquished, sir knight, nay dead unless you admit the conditions of our defiance.
<p/>Don Quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) visor said in a weak feeble voice as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) were speaking out of a tomb, <div class="bookquote">``Dulcinea del Toboso is the fairest woman in the world, and I the most unfortunate knight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by my feebleness; drive your lance home, sir knight, and take my life, since you have taken away my honour.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That will I not, in sooth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of the White Moon; <div class="bookquote">``live the fame of the lady Dulcinea's beauty undimmed as ever; all I require is that the great Don Quixote retire to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own home for a year, or for so long a time as shall by me be enjoined upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), as we agreed before engaging in this combat.
<p/>The viceroy, Don Antonio, and several others who were present heard all this, and heard too how Don Quixote replied that so long as nothing in prejudice of Dulcinea was demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would observe all the rest like a true and loyal knight.
<p/>The engagement given, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) of the White Moon wheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with a movement of the head, rode away into the city at a half gallop.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div>, he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) hurled Don Quixote and Rocinante to the earth, a perilous fall. '' '' The viceroy bade Don Antonio hasten after him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>), and by some means or other find out who he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) was.
<p/>They raised Don Quixote up and uncovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) face, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pale and bathed with sweat. Rocinante from the mere hard measure he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had received lay unable to stir for the present.
<p/>Sancho, wholly dejected and woebegone, knew not what to say or do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fancied that all was a dream, that the whole business was a piece of enchantment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) saw the light of the glory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) achievements obscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) swept away like smoke before the wind; Rocinante, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) feared, was crippled for life, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master's bones out of joint; for if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) were only shaken out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) madness it would be no small luck.
<p/>In the end they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) into the city in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and thither the viceroy himself returned, eager to ascertain who this Knight of the White Moon was who had left Don Quixote in such a sad plight.
<p/>Here was his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master defeated, and bound not to take up arms for a year. CHAPTER LXV. WHEREIN IS MADE KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE WHITE MOON WAS;
<p/>LIKEWISE DON GREGORIO'S RELEASE, AND OTHER EVENTS Don Antonia Moreno followed the Knight of the White Moon, and a number of boys followed him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) too, nay pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), until they had him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) fairly housed in a hostel in the heart of the city.
<p/>Don Antonio, eager to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) acquaintance, entered also; a squire came out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) and remove his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) armour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) shut himself into a lower room, still attended by Don Antonio, whose bread would not bake until he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) had found out who he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) of the White Moon, seeing then that the gentleman would not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), said, ``I know very well, senor, what you have come for; it is to find out who I am; and as there is no reason why I should conceal it from you, while my servant here is taking off my armour I will tell you the true state of the case, without leaving out anything.
<p/>I am of the same village as Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze and folly make all of us who know him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feel pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and I am one of those who have felt it most; and persuaded that his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chance of recovery lay in quiet and keeping at home and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own house
<p/>You must know, senor, that I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. , I hit upon a device for keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) there.
<p/>Three months ago, therefore, I went out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) as a knight-errant, under the assumed name of the Knight of the Mirrors, intending to engage him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) in combat and overcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) without hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>), making it the condition of our combat that the vanquished should be at the disposal of the victor.
<p/>What I meant to demand of him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) -LRB-for I regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) as vanquished already-RRB- was that he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) should return to his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) own village, and not leave it for a whole year, by which time he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) might be cured.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) way, and I came back conquered, covered with shame, and sorely bruised by my fall, which was a particularly dangerous one.
<p/>But fate ordered it otherwise, for he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) vanquished me and unhorsed me, and so my plan failed. But this did not quench my desire to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) again and overcome him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>), as you have seen to-day.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) is so scrupulous in his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) observance of the laws of knight-errantry, he (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) will, no doubt, in order to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>) word, obey the injunction I have laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>victor</b></font>).
<p/>I implore of you not to betray me, or tell Don Quixote who I am; so that my honest endeavours may be successful, and that a man of excellent wits--were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only rid of the fooleries of chivalry--may get them back again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>said Don Antonio, <div class="bookquote">``may God forgive you the wrong you have done the whole world in trying to bring the most amusing madman in it back to his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) senses.
<p/>This, senor, is how the matter stands, and I have nothing more to tell you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>Do you not see, senor, that the gain by Don Quixote's sanity can never equal the enjoyment his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) crazes give?
<p/>But my belief is that all the senor bachelor's pains will be of no avail to bring a man so hopelessly cracked to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses again; and if it were not uncharitable, I would say may Don Quixote never be cured, for by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) recovery we lose not only his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own drolleries, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire Sancho Panza's too, any one of which is enough to turn melancholy itself into merriment.
<p/>However, I'll hold my peace and say nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), and we'll see whether I am right in my suspicion that Senor Carrasco's efforts will be fruitless.
<p/>The bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) hoped for a happy result from it; and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) services at Don Antonio's commands he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>); and having had his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) armour packed at once upon a mule, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) rode away from the city the same day on the horse he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) rode to battle, and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) own country without meeting any adventure calling for record in this veracious history.
<p/>Don Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>), and the viceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote's retirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) mad doings.
<p/>Six days did Don Quixote keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and out of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) defeat.
<p/>Sancho strove to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and among other things he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Hold up your head, senor, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to heaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come off with a broken rib; and, as you know that `where they give they take,' and that `there are not always fletches where there are pegs,' a fig for the doctor, for there's no need of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to cure this ailment.
<p/>Let us go home, and give over going about in search of adventures in strange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am the greater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage.
<p/>With the government I gave up all wish to be a governor again, but I did not give up all longing to be a count; and that will never come to pass if your worship gives up becoming a king by renouncing the calling of chivalry; and so my hopes are going to turn into smoke.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>; I shall soon return to my honoured calling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and a county to bestow on thee.''
<p/>May God hear it and sin be deaf,'' said Sancho; ``I have always heard say that 'a good hope is better than a bad holding.
<p/>As they were talking Don Antonio came in looking extremely pleased and exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Reward me for my good news, Senor Don Quixote!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Peace, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``thou seest my suspension and retirement is not to exceed a year ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' Don Gregorio and the renegade who went for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) have come ashore--ashore
<p/>Don Quixote cheered up a little and said, <div class="bookquote">``Of a truth I am almost ready to say I should have been glad had it turned out just the other way, for it would have obliged me to cross over to Barbary, where by the might of my arm I should have restored to liberty, not only Don Gregorio, but all the Christian captives there are in Barbary.
<p/>do I say? They are by this time in the viceroy's house, and will be here immediately. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>But what am I saying, miserable being that I am?
<p/>Am I not he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) that has been conquered? Am I not he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) that has been overthrown? Am I not he (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) who must not take up arms for a year?
<p/>Then what am I making professions for; what am I bragging about; when it is fitter for me to handle the distaff than the sword?''
<p/>No more of that, senor,'' said Sancho; ''`let the hen live, even though it be with her (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) pip;' `to-day for thee and to-morrow for me;' in these affairs of encounters and whacks one must not mind them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that falls to-day may get up to-morrow; unless indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) chooses to lie in bed, I mean gives way to weakness and does not pluck up fresh spirit for fresh battles; let your worship get up now to receive Don Gregorio; for the household seems to be in a bustle, and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) has come by this time;'' and so it proved, for as soon as Don Gregorio and the renegade had given the viceroy an account of the voyage out and home, Don Gregorio, eager to see Ana Felix, came with the renegade to Don Antonio's house.
<p/>When they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) away from Algiers he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) was in woman's dress; on board the vessel, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) exchanged it for that of a captive who escaped with him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>); but in whatever dress he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) might be he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) looked like one to be loved and served and esteemed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) was surpassingly well-favoured, and to judge by appearances some seventeen or eighteen years of age.
<p/>'' Ricote and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) daughter came out to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>), the father with tears, the daughter with bashfulness. They did not embrace each other, for where there is deep love there will never be overmuch boldness.
<p/>Seen side by side, the comeliness of Don Gregorio and the beauty of Ana Felix were the admiration of all who were present.
<p/>It was silence that spoke for the lovers at that moment, and their eyes were the tongues that declared their pure and happy feelings.
<p/>The renegade explained the measures and means he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) had adopted to rescue Don Gregorio, and Don Gregorio at no great length, but in a few words, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) showed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) intelligence was in advance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) years, described the peril and embarrassment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) found himself in among the women with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) had sojourned.
<p/>To conclude, Ricote liberally recompensed and rewarded as well the renegade as the men who had rowed; and the renegade effected his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) readmission into the body of the Church and was reconciled with it, and from a rotten limb became by penance and repentance a clean and sound one.
<p/>the steps they should take to enable Ana Felix and her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) father to stay in Spain, for it seemed to them there could be no objection to a daughter who was so good a Christian and a father to all appearance so well disposed remaining there.
<p/>Don Antonio offered to arrange the matter at the capital, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) was compelled to go on some other business, hinting that many a difficult affair was settled there with the help of favour and bribes.
<p/>Nay,'' said Ricote, who was present during the conversation, <div class="bookquote">``it will not do to rely upon favour or bribes, because with the great Don Bernardino de Velasco, Conde de Salazar, to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Salazar</b></font>) Majesty has entrusted our expulsion, neither entreaties nor promises, bribes nor appeals to compassion, are of any use; for though it is true he (<font color='blue'><b>Salazar</b></font>) mingles mercy with justice, still, seeing that the whole body of our nation is tainted and corrupt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Salazar</b></font>) applies to it the cautery that burns rather than the salve that soothes; and thus, by prudence, sagacity, care and the fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Salazar</b></font>) inspires, he (<font color='blue'><b>Salazar</b></font>) has borne on his (<font color='blue'><b>Salazar</b></font>) mighty shoulders the weight of this great policy and carried it into effect, all our schemes and plots, importunities and wiles, being ineffectual to blind his (<font color='blue'><b>Salazar</b></font>) Argus eyes, ever on the watch lest one of us should remain behind in concealment, and like a hidden root come in course of time to sprout and bear poisonous fruit in Spain, now cleansed, and relieved of the fear in which our vast numbers kept it.
<p/>Heroic resolve of the great Philip the Third, and unparalleled wisdom to have entrusted it to the said Don Bernardino de Velasco!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ricote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>said Don Antonio, <div class="bookquote">``when I am there I will make all possible efforts, and let heaven do as pleases it best; Don Gregorio will come with me to relieve the anxiety which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) parents must be suffering on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) absence; Ana Felix will remain in my house with my wife, or in a monastery; and I know the viceroy will be glad that the worthy Ricote should stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>viceroy</b></font>) until we see what terms I can make.
<p/>The viceroy agreed to all that was proposed; but Don Gregorio on learning what had passed declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) could not and would not on any account leave Ana Felix; however, as it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) purpose to go and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) parents and devise some way of returning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) fell in with the proposed arrangement.
<p/>Two days later the viceroy discussed with Don Antonio ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Antonio/Don Antonio Moreno/Antonio</b></font>)</div>'' Ana Felix remained with Don Antonio's wife, and Ricote in the viceroy's house.
<p/>The day for Don Antonio's departure came; and two days later that for Don Quixote's and Sancho's, for Don Quixote's fall did not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to take the road sooner.
<p/>Ricote offered Don Gregorio a thousand crowns if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) would have them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) would not take any save five which Don Antonio lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) promised to repay at the capital.
<p/>So the two of them took their departure, and Don Quixote and Sancho afterwards, as has been already said, Don Quixote without his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) armour and in travelling gear, and Sancho on foot, Dapple being loaded with the armour.
<p/>There were tears and sighs, swoonings and sobs, at the parting between Don Gregorio and Ana Felix. CHAPTER LXVI. WHICH TREATS OF WHAT HE (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) WHO READS
<p/>WILL SEE, OR WHAT HE (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) WHO HAS IT READ TO HIM WILL HEAR As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregorio</b></font>) left Barcelona, Don Quixote turned gaze upon the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had fallen.
<p/>Here Troy was,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``here my ill-luck, not my cowardice, robbed me of all the glory I had won; here Fortune made me the victim of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) caprices; here the lustre of my achievements was dimmed; here, in a word, fell my happiness never to rise again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho on hearing this, <div class="bookquote">``it is the part of brave hearts to be patient in adversity just as much as to be glad in prosperity; I judge by myself, for, if when I was a governor I was glad, now that I am a squire and on foot
<p/>I am not sad; and I have heard say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) whom commonly they call Fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, what is more, blind, and therefore neither sees what she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) does, nor knows whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) casts down or whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) sets up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Thou art a great philosopher, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``thou speakest very sensibly ; I know not who taught thee.
<p/>But I can tell thee there is no such thing as Fortune in the world, nor does anything which takes place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance, but by the special preordination of heaven; and hence the common saying that `each of us is the maker of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own Fortune.'
<p/>my self-confidence has therefore made me pay dearly; for I ought to have reflected that Rocinante's feeble strength could not resist the mighty bulk of the Knight of the White Moon's horse.
<p/>I have been that of mine; but not with the proper amount of prudence, and In a word, I ventured it
<p/>, I did my best, I was overthrown, but though I lost my honour I did not lose nor can I lose the virtue of keeping my word.
<p/>When I was a knight-errant, daring and valiant, I supported my achievements by hand and deed, and now that I am a humble squire I will support my words by keeping the promise I have given.
<p/>Forward then, Sancho my friend, let us go to keep the year of the novitiate in our own country, and in that seclusion we shall pick up fresh strength to return to the by me never-forgotten calling of arms.''

<p/>Let us leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead of some one that has been hanged; and then with me on Dapple's back and my feet off the ground we will arrange the stages as your worship pleases to measure them out; but to suppose that I am going to travel on foot, and make long ones, is to suppose nonsense.
<p/>Thou sayest well, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``let my armour be hung up for a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve on the trees what was inscribed on the trophy of Roland's armour--
<p/>That's the very thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``and if it was not that we should feel the want of Rocinante on the road, it would be as well to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hung up too.
<p/>And yet, I had rather not have either him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) or the armour hung up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``that it may not be said, `for good service a bad return.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your worship is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; ``for, as sensible people hold, `the fault of the ass must not be laid on the pack-saddle;' and, as in this affair the fault is your worship's, punish yourself and don't let your anger break out against the already battered and bloody armour, or the meekness of Rocinante, or the tenderness of my feet, trying to make them travel more than is reasonable.
<p/>In converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the four succeeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey, but on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number of people at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.
<p/>Upon Don Quixote's approach a peasant called out, <div class="bookquote">``One of these two gentlemen who come here, and who don't know the parties, will tell us what we ought to do about our wager.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a peasant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``and according to the rights of the case, if I can manage to understand it.

<p/>Well, here it is, worthy sir,'' said the peasant; <div class="bookquote">``a man of this village who is so fat that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) weighs twenty stone challenged another,
<p/>The agreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with equal weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were to be equalised he (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) said that the other, as he (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) weighed nine stone, should put eleven in iron on his (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) back, and that in this way the twenty stone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the peasant man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote could answer; ``it's for me, that only a few days ago left off being a governor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful questions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Answer in God's name, Sancho my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``for I am not fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset.

<p/>My decision, therefore, is that the fat challenger prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself, and take eleven stone of his (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) flesh off his (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) body, here or there, as he (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) pleases, and as suits him (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) best; and being in this way reduced to nine stone weight, he (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) will make himself equal and even with nine stone of his (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) opponent, and they will be able to run on equal terms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all that's good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasants</b></font>)</div>said one of the peasants as he (<font color='blue'><b>challenger</b></font>) heard Sancho's decision, <div class="bookquote">``but the gentleman has spoken like a saint, and given judgment like a canon!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I cannot stop for an instant, for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seem discourteous and to travel apace;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and spurring Rocinante he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pushed on, leaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own strange figure and at the shrewdness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) servant, for such they took Sancho to be; and another of them observed, ``If the servant is so clever, what must the master be?
<p/>I'll bet, if they are going to Salamanca to study, they'll come to be alcaldes of the Court in a trice; for it's a mere joke--only to read and read, and have interest and good luck; and before a man knows where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finds himself with a staff in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand or a mitre on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/>That night master and man passed out in the fields in the open air, and the next day as they were pursuing their journey
<p/>they saw coming towards them a man on foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or spiked staff in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came close to Don Quixote, increased his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pace and half running came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and embracing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right thigh, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could reach no higher, exclaimed with evident pleasure, <div class="bookquote">``O Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, what happiness it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) knows your worship is coming back to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) castle, for he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is still there with my lady the duchess!''

<p/>I thought to marry without fighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my scheme had a very different result, for as soon as your worship had left the castle my lord the duke had a hundred strokes of the stick given me for having acted contrary to the orders he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) gave me before engaging in the combat; and the end of the whole affair is that the girl has become a nun, and Dona Rodriguez has gone back to Castile, and I am now on my way to Barcelona with a packet of letters for the viceroy which my master is sending him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).

<p/>especially now that it is all over with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), for here he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is beaten by the Knight of the White Moon.
<p/>Tosilos begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to explain what had happened him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), but Sancho replied that it would not be good manners to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); and that some other day if they met there would be time enough for that; and then getting up, after shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) doublet and brushing the crumbs out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) drove Dapple on before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and bidding adieu to Tosilos left him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and rejoined his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, who was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) under the shade of a tree.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was under the shade of a tree, as has been said, and there, like flies on honey, thoughts came crowding upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and stinging him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Some of them turned upon the disenchantment of Dulcinea, others upon the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was about to lead in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enforced retirement.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER LXVII. OF THE RESOLUTION DON QUIXOTE FORMED TO TURN SHEPHERD AND TAKE TO A LIFE IN THE FIELDS Sancho came up and spoke in high praise of the generous disposition of the lacquey Tosilos.
<p/>Apparently it has escaped thy memory that thou hast seen Dulcinea turned and transformed into a peasant wench, and the Knight of the Mirrors into the bachelor Carrasco; all the work of the enchanters that persecute me.
<p/>But tell me now, didst thou ask this Tosilos, as thou callest him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>), what has become of Altisidora, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) weep over my absence, or has she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) already consigned to oblivion the love thoughts that used to afflict her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) when I was present?''
<p/>'' Is it possible, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``that thou dost still think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) yonder is a real lacquey? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>The thoughts that I had,'' said Sancho, ``were not such as to leave time for asking fool's questions. Body o' me, senor!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look ye, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``there is a great difference between what is done out of love and what is done out of gratitude.
<p/>is your worship in a condition now to inquire into other people's thoughts, above all love thoughts?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>A knight may very possibly be proof against love; but it is impossible, strictly speaking, for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to be ungrateful.
<p/>Altisidora, to all appearance, loved me truly; she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) gave me the three kerchiefs thou knowest of; she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) wept at my departure, she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) cursed me,
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) abused me, casting shame to the winds she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) bewailed herself in public; all signs that she (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) adored me; for the wrath of lovers always ends in curses.
<p/>I had no hopes to give her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), nor treasures to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), for mine are given to Dulcinea, and the treasures of knights-errant are like those of the fairies,' illusory and deceptive; all I can give her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) is the place in my memory I keep for her (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>), without prejudice, however, to that which I hold devoted to Dulcinea, whom thou art wronging by thy remissness in whipping thyself and scourging that flesh--
<p/>would that I saw it eaten by wolves--which would rather keep itself for the worms than for the relief of that poor lady.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>replied Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``if the truth is to be told, I cannot persuade myself that the whipping of my backside has anything to do with the disenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, `If your head aches rub ointment on your knees;' at any rate I'll make bold to swear that in all the histories dealing with knight-errantry that your worship has read you have never come across anybody disenchanted by whipping; but whether or no I'll whip myself when I have a fancy for it, and the opportunity serves for scourging myself comfortably.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God grant it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; ``and heaven give thee grace to take it to heart and own the obligation thou art under to help my lady, who is thine also, inasmuch as thou art mine.
<p/>As they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the very same spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls.
<p/>Don Quixote recognised it, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``This is the meadow where we came upon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who were trying to revive and imitate the pastoral Arcadia there, an idea as novel as it was happy, in emulation whereof, if so be thou dost approve of it, Sancho, I would have ourselves turn shepherds, at any rate for the time I have to live in retirement.
<p/>I will buy some ewes and everything else requisite for the pastoral calling; and, I under the name of the shepherd Quixotize and thou as the shepherd Panzino, we will roam the woods and groves and meadows singing songs here, lamenting in elegies there, drinking of the crystal waters of the springs or limpid brooks or flowing rivers.
<p/>The oaks will yield us their sweet fruit with bountiful hand, the trunks of the hard cork trees a seat, the willows shade, the roses perfume, the widespread meadows carpets tinted with a thousand dyes; the clear pure air will give us breath, the moon and stars lighten the darkness of the night for us
<p/>, song shall be our delight, lamenting our joy, Apollo will supply us with verses, and love with conceits whereby we shall make ourselves famed for ever, not only in this but in ages to come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Egad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but that sort of life squares, nay corners, with my notions; and what is more the bachelor Samson Carrasco and Master Nicholas
<p/>the barber won't have well seen it before they'll want to follow it and turn shepherds along with us; and God grant it may not come into the curate's head to join the sheepfold too, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s so jovial and fond of enjoying himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote; ``and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) enters the pastoral fraternity, as no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) will, may call himself the shepherd Samsonino, or perhaps the shepherd Carrascon; Nicholas the barber may call himself Niculoso, as old Boscan formerly was called Nemoroso; as for the curate I don't know what name we can fit to him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) unless it be something derived from his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) title, and we call him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) the shepherd Curiambro.
<p/>For the shepherdesses whose lovers we shall be, we can pick names as we would pears; and as my lady's name does just as well for a shepherdess's as for a princess's, I need not trouble myself to look for one that will suit her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) better; to thine,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to give her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) any but Teresona,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``which will go well with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) stoutness and with her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) own right name, as she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) is called Teresa; and then when I sing her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) praises in my verses I'll show how chaste my passion is, for I'm not going to look `for better bread than ever came from wheat' in other men's houses.
<p/>It won't do for the curate to have a shepherdess, for the sake of good example; and if the bachelor chooses to have one, that is his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) look-out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Sancho, thou canst give what name thou wilt. '' <div class="bookquote">``God bless me, Sancho my friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``what a life we shall lead!
<p/>And then if among all these different sorts of music that of the albogues is heard, almost all the pastoral instruments will be there.
<p/>What hautboys and Zamora bagpipes we shall hear, what tabors, timbrels, and rebecks! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' What are albogues?'' asked Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for I never in my life heard tell of them or saw them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>make a noise which, if not very pleasing or harmonious, is not disagreeable and accords very well with the rude notes of the bagpipe and tabor.
<p/>The word albogue is Morisco, as are all those in our Spanish tongue that begin with al; for example, almohaza, almorzar, alhombra, alguacil, alhucema, almacen, alcancia, and others of the same sort, of which there are not many more; our language has only three that are Morisco and end in i, which are borcegui, zaquizami, and maravedi.
<p/>Alheli and alfaqui are seen to be Arabic, as well by the al at the beginning as by the i they end with.
<p/>I mention this incidentally, the chance allusion to albogues having reminded me of it; and it will be of great assistance to us in the perfect practice of this calling that I am something of a poet, as thou knowest, and that besides the bachelor Samson Carrasco is an accomplished one.
<p/>Of the curate I say nothing; but I will wager he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) has some spice of the poet in him (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>), and no doubt Master Nicholas too, for all barbers, or most of them, are guitar players and stringers of verses.
<p/>I will bewail my separation; thou shalt glorify thyself as a constant lover; the shepherd Carrascon will figure as a rejected one, and the curate Curiambro as whatever may please him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) best; and so all will go as gaily as heart could wish.
<p/>To this Sancho made answer, ``I am so unlucky, senor, that I'm afraid the day will never come when I'll see myself at such a calling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Albogues,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``are brass plates like candlesticks that struck against one another on the hollow side ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>O what neat spoons I'll make when I'm a shepherd!
<p/>What messes, creams, garlands, pastoral odds and ends! And if they don't get me a name for wisdom, they'll not fail to get me one for ingenuity.
<p/>My daughter Sanchica will bring us our dinner to the pasture. But stay- she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s good-looking, and shepherds there are with more mischief than simplicity in them
<p/>; I would not have her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) `come for wool and go back shorn;' love-making and lawless desires are just as common in the fields as in the cities, and in shepherds' shanties as in royal palaces; `do away with the cause, you do away with the sin;' `if eyes don't see hearts don't break' and `better a clear escape than good men's prayers.'''
<p/>A truce to thy proverbs, Sancho,'' exclaimed Don Quixote; ``any one of those thou hast uttered would suffice to explain thy meaning; many a time have I recommended thee not to be so lavish with proverbs and to exercise some moderation in delivering them; but it seems to me it is only `preaching in the desert;' `my mother beats me
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that your worship is like the common saying, `Said the frying-pan to the kettle, Get away, blackbreech.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and I go on with my tricks.'' You chide me for uttering proverbs, and you string them in couples yourself.''
<p/>they fit like a ring to the finger; thou bringest them in by the head and shoulders, in such a way that thou dost drag them in, rather than introduce them; if I am not mistaken, I have told thee already that proverbs are short maxims drawn from the experience and observation of our wise men of old; but the proverb that is not to the purpose is a piece of nonsense and not a maxim.
<p/>But enough of this; as nightfall is drawing on let us retire some little distance from the high road to pass the night; what is in store for us to-morrow God knoweth.
<p/>They turned aside, and supped late and poorly, very much against Sancho's will, who turned over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mind the hardships attendant upon knight-errantry in woods and forests, even though at times plenty presented itself in castles and houses, as at Don Diego de Miranda's, at the wedding of Camacho the Rich, and at Don Antonio Moreno's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>) reflected, however, that it could not be always day, nor always night; and so that night he (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>) passed in sleeping, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Moreno</b></font>) master in waking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Observe, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``I bring in proverbs to the purpose, and when I quote them ''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER LXVIII.

<p/>it was not in a quarter where she (<font color='blue'><b>Camacho</b></font>) could be seen; for sometimes the lady Diana goes on a stroll to the antipodes, and leaves the mountains all black and the valleys in darkness.
<p/>Don Quixote obeyed nature so far as to sleep his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) first sleep, but did not give way to the second, very different from Sancho, who never had any second, because with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sleep lasted from night till morning, wherein he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) showed what a sound constitution and few cares he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had.
<p/>Don Quixote's cares kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) restless, so much so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) awoke Sancho and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am amazed, Sancho, at the unconcern of thy temperament.
<p/>ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE The night was somewhat dark, for though there was a moon in the sky I believe thou art made of marble or hard brass, incapable of any emotion or feeling whatever.
<p/>I lie awake while thou sleepest , I weep while thou singest, I am faint with fasting while thou art sluggish and torpid from pure repletion.
<p/>It is the duty of good servants to share the sufferings and feel the sorrows of their masters, if it be only for the sake of appearances.
<p/>See the calmness of the night, the solitude of the spot, inviting us to break our slumbers by a vigil of some sort.

<p/>Sleep, I have heard say, has only one fault, that it is like death; for between a sleeping man and a dead man there is very little difference.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never have I heard thee speak so elegantly as now, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``and here I begin to see the truth of the proverb thou dost sometimes quote, `Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed.'
<p/>Ha, by my life, master mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``it's not I that am stringing proverbs now, for they drop in pairs from your worship's mouth faster than from mine; only there is this difference between mine and yours, that yours are well-timed and mine are untimely; but anyhow, they are all proverbs.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' At this point they became aware of a harsh indistinct noise that seemed to spread through all the valleys around.
<p/>Don Quixote stood up and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sword, and Sancho ensconced himself under Dapple and put the bundle of armour on one side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and the ass's pack-saddle on the other, in fear and trembling as great as Don Quixote's perturbation.
<p/>Each instant the noise increased and came nearer to the two terrified men, or at least to one, for as to the other, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) courage is known to all.
<p/>The fact of the matter was that some men were taking above six hundred pigs to sell at a fair, and were on their way with them at that hour, and so great was the noise they made and their grunting and blowing, that they deafened the ears of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and they could not make out what it was.
<p/>The wide-spread grunting drove came on in a surging mass, and without showing any respect for Don Quixote's dignity or Sancho's, passed right over the pair of them, demolishing Sancho's entrenchments, and not only upsetting Don Quixote but sweeping Rocinante off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) feet into the bargain; and what with the trampling and the grunting, and the pace at which the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle, armour, Dapple and Rocinante were left scattered on the ground and Sancho and Don Quixote at their wits' end.
<p/>Sancho got up as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could and begged his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sword, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerly pigs, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had by this time found out that that was what they were.
<p/>Let them be, my friend,'' said Don Quixote; ``this insult is the penalty of my sin; and it is the righteous chastisement of heaven that jackals should devour a vanquished knight, and wasps sting him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) and pigs trample him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) under foot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is the chastisement of heaven, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that flies should prick the squires of vanquished knights, and lice eat them, and hunger assail them.
<p/>If we squires were the sons of the knights we serve, or their very near relations, it would be no wonder if the penalty of their misdeeds overtook us, even to the fourth generation.
<p/>Well, well, let's lie down again and sleep out what little of the night there's left, and God will send us dawn and we shall be all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Sleep thou, Sancho,'' returned Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for thou wast born to sleep as I was born to watch; and during the time it now wants of dawn I will give a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent for them in a little madrigal which, unknown to thee, I composed in my head last night.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that the thoughts that allow one to make verses cannot be of great consequence; let your worship string verses as much as you like
<p/>and I'll sleep as much as I can;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and forthwith, taking the space of ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) required, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) muffled himself up and fell into a sound sleep, undisturbed by bond, debt, or trouble of any sort.
<p/>Don Quixote, propped up against the trunk of a beech or a cork tree--for Cide Hamete does not specify what kind of tree it was--sang in this strain to the accompaniment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own sighs:
<p/>'' '' But what have the Panzas to do with the Quixotes? '' When in my mind I muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty,
<p/>But drawing near That welcome haven in my sea of woe, Such joy I know, That life revives, and still I linger here.
<p/>Thus life doth slay, And death again to life restoreth me; Strange destiny, That deals with life and death as with a play!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears, just like one whose heart was pierced with grief at his (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) defeat and his (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) separation from Dulcinea.
<p/>To death I flee, In hope therein the end of all to find. And now daylight came, and the sun smote Sancho on the eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) beams.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lazy limbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) stores he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cursed the drove, and more besides.
<p/>Then the pair resumed their journey, and as evening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten men on horseback and four or five on foot.
<p/>Don Quixote's heart beat quick and Sancho's quailed with fear, for the persons approaching them carried lances and bucklers, and were in very warlike guise.
<p/>Don Quixote turned to Sancho and said, ``If I could make use of my weapons, and my promise had not tied my hands, I would count this host that comes against us but cakes and fancy bread; but perhaps it may prove something different from what we apprehend.
<p/>The men on horseback now came up, and raising their lances surrounded Don Quixote in silence, and pointed them at his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) back and breast, menacing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) with death.
<p/>One of those on foot, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) finger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lips as a sign to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to be silent, seized Rocinante's bridle and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) out of the road, and the others driving Sancho and Dapple before them, and all maintaining a strange silence, followed in the steps of the one who led Don Quixote.
<p/>The latter two or three times attempted to ask where they were taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to and what they wanted, but the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lips they threatened to close them with the points of their lances; and Sancho fared the same way, for the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) seemed about to speak one of those on foot punched him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) with a goad, and
<p/>Night set in, they quickened their pace, and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they heard themselves assailed with--<div class="bookquote">``Get on, ye Troglodytes;''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoners</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Silence, ye barbarians;''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoners</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``March, ye cannibals;''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoners</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No murmuring, ye Scythians;''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoners</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't open your eyes, ye
<p/>murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty lions,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoners</b></font>)</div>and suchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched master and man.
<p/>I don't like those names at all; `it's in a bad wind our corn is being winnowed;' `misfortune comes upon us all at once like sticks on a dog,' and God grant it may be no worse than them that this unlucky adventure has in store for us.
<p/>'' Dapple likewise, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) too wanted to talk. Sancho went along saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``We, tortolites, barbers, animals! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Don Quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) wits to make out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they called them, and the only conclusion he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could arrive at was that there was no good to be hoped for and much evil to be feared.
<p/>And now, about an hour after midnight, they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw at once was the duke's, where they had been but a short time before.
<p/>It is all courtesy and politeness in this house; but with the vanquished good turns into evil, and evil into worse.
<p/>They entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared and fitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled their fears, as will be seen in the following chapter.
<p/>'' God bless me!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) recognised the mansion, <div class="bookquote">``what does this mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER LXIX. OF THE STRANGEST AND MOST EXTRAORDINARY
<p/>The horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot, without a moment's delay taking up Sancho and Don Quixote bodily, they carried them into the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed in sockets were burning, besides above five hundred lamps in the corridors, so that in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the want of daylight could not be perceived.
<p/>In the middle of the court was a catafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and covered completely by an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all round it white wax tapers burned in more than a hundred silver candlesticks.
<p/>Upon the catafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel so lovely that by her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) beauty she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) made death itself look beautiful.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) head resting upon a cushion of brocade and crowned with a garland of sweet-smelling flowers of divers sorts, her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) hands crossed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) bosom, and between them a branch of yellow palm of victory.
<p/>On one side of the court was erected a stage, where upon two chairs were seated two persons who from having crowns on their heads and sceptres in their hands appeared to be kings of some sort, whether real or mock ones.
<p/>By the side of this stage, which was reached by steps, were two other chairs on which the men carrying the prisoners seated Don Quixote and Sancho, all in silence, and by signs giving them to understand that they too were to be silent; which, however, they would have been without any signs, for their amazement at all they saw
<p/>And now two persons of distinction, who were at once recognised by Don Quixote as his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hosts the duke and duchess, ascended the stage attended by a numerous suite, and seated themselves on two gorgeous chairs close to the two kings, as they seemed to be.
<p/>ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS GREAT HISTORY held them tongue-tied. Who would not have been amazed at this?
<p/>Nor was this all, for Don Quixote had perceived that the dead body on the catafalque was that of the fair Altisidora.
<p/>As the duke and duchess mounted the stage Don Quixote and Sancho rose and made them a profound obeisance, which they returned by bowing their heads slightly.
<p/>At this moment an official crossed over, and approaching Sancho threw over him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a robe of black buckram painted all over with flames of fire, and taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cap put upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) head a mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the Holy Office wear; and whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) must not open his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) lips, or they would put a gag upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), or take his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) life.
<p/>Sancho surveyed himself from head to foot and saw himself all ablaze with flames; but as they did not burn him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did not care two farthings for them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) took off the mitre, and seeing it painted with devils he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) put it on again, saying to himself, ``Well, so far those don't burn me nor do these carry me off.
<p/>Don Quixote surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) too, and though fear had got the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) faculties, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could not help smiling to see the figure Sancho presented.
<p/>And now from underneath the catafalque, so it seemed, there rose a low sweet sound of flutes, which, coming unbroken by human voice -LRB-for there silence itself kept silence-RRB-, had a soft and languishing effect.
<p/>Then, beside the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body, suddenly appeared a fair youth in a Roman habit, who, to the accompaniment of a harp which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) himself played, sang in a sweet and clear voice these two stanzas:
<p/>While fair Altisidora, who the sport Of cold Don Quixote's cruelty hath been, Returns to life, and in this magic court
<p/>The dames in sables come to grace the scene, And while her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) matrons all in seemly sort My lady robes in baize and bombazine, Her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) beauty and her (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) sorrows will I sing With defter quill than touched the Thracian string.
<p/>But not in life alone, methinks, to me Belongs the office; Lady, when my tongue Is cold in death, believe me, unto thee My voice shall raise its tributary song.
<p/>My soul, from this strait prison-house set free, As o'er the Stygian lake it floats along, Thy praises singing still shall hold its way, And make the waters of oblivion stay.
<p/>It would be an endless task to put before us now the death and the charms of the peerless Altisidora, not dead as the ignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in the penance which Sancho Panza, here present, has to undergo to restore her (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) to the long-lost light.
<p/>Do thou, therefore, O Rhadamanthus, who sittest in judgment with me in the murky caverns of Dis, as thou knowest all that the inscrutable fates have decreed touching the resuscitation of this damsel, announce and declare it at once, that the happiness we look forward to from her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) restoration be no longer deferred.
<p/>No sooner had Minos the fellow judge of Rhadamanthus said this, than Rhadamanthus rising up said: <div class="bookquote">``Ho, officials of this house, high and low, great and small, make haste hither one and all, and print on Sancho's face four-and-twenty smacks, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) twelve pinches and six pin thrusts in the back and arms; for upon this ceremony depends the restoration of Altisidora.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Rhadamanthus</b></font>)</div>At this point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Enough, enough, divine singer! ''  (<font color='red'><b>kings</b></font>)</div>'' On hearing this Sancho broke silence and cried out,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By all that's good, I'll as soon let my face be smacked or handled as turn Moor. Body o' me! What has handling my face got to do with the resurrection of this damsel? '
<p/>The old woman took kindly to the blits; they enchant Dulcinea, and whip me in order to disenchant her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>); Altisidora dies of ailments God was pleased to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>), and to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) to life again they must give me four-and-twenty smacks, and prick holes in my body with pins, and raise weals on my arms with pinches!
<p/>Thou shalt die,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Rhadamanthus in a loud voice; ``relent, thou tiger; humble thyself, proud Nimrod; suffer and be silent, for no impossibilities are asked of thee; it is not for thee to inquire into the difficulties in this matter; smacked thou must be, pricked thou shalt see thyself, and with pinches thou must be made to howl.
<p/>Ho, I say, officials, obey my orders; or by the word of an honest man, ye shall see what ye were born for.
<p/>Try those jokes on a brother-in-law; `I'm an old dog, and <div class="bookquote">``tus, tus''  (<font color='red'><b>an dog</b></font>)</div>is no use with me.' '' '' ''
<p/>At this some six duennas, advancing across the court, made their appearance in procession, one after the other, four of them with spectacles, and all with their right hands uplifted, showing four fingers of wrist to make their hands look longer, as is the fashion now-a-days.
<p/>No sooner had Sancho caught sight of them than, bellowing like a bull, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) exclaimed, ``I might let myself be handled by all the world; but allow duennas to touch me--not a bit of it!
<p/>Scratch my face, as my master was served in this very castle; run me through the body with burnished daggers; pinch my arms with red-hot pincers; I'll bear all in patience to serve these gentlefolk; but I won't let duennas touch me, though the devil should carry me off!
<p/>Here Don Quixote, too, broke silence, saying to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Have patience, my son, and gratify these noble persons, and give all thanks to heaven that it has infused such virtue into thy person, that by its sufferings thou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the dead.
<p/>The duennas were now close to Sancho, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), having become more tractable and reasonable, settling himself well in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) chair presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) face and beard to the first, who delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a smack very stoutly laid on, and then made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) a low curtsey.
<p/>In fine, all the duennas smacked him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) and several others of the household pinched him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could not stand was being pricked by the pins; and so, apparently out of patience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) started up out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) chair, and seizing a lighted torch that stood near him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) fell upon the duennas and the whole set of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tormentors, exclaiming,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' Less politeness and less paint, senora duenna,'' said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``by God your hands smell of vinegar-wash. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>``Begone, ye ministers of hell; I'm not made of brass not to feel such out-of-the-way tortures.
<p/>At this instant Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so long lying on her (<font color='blue'><b>duenna</b></font>) back, turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>duenna</b></font>) side; seeing which the bystanders cried out almost with one voice, <div class="bookquote">``Altisidora is alive!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the bystanders</b></font>)</div>Altisidora lives!'' Rhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wrath, as the object they had in view was now attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knees to Sancho saying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>),
<p/>``Now is the time, son of my bowels, not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those lashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.
<p/>Now, I say, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and endowed with efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.
<p/>To which Sancho made answer, <div class="bookquote">``That's trick upon trick, I think, and not honey upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come now, on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings!
<p/>You had better take a big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me into a well; I should not mind it much, if I'm to be always made the cow of the wedding for the cure of other people's ailments.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Leave me alone; or else by God I'll fling the whole thing to the dogs, let come what may. ''
<p/>Altisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did so the clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of all present exclaiming, ``Long life to Altisidora!
<p/>The duke and duchess and the kings Minos and Rhadamanthus stood up, and all, together with Don Quixote and Sancho, advanced to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) and take her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) down from the catafalque; and she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), making as though she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) were recovering from a swoon, bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) head to the duke and duchess and to the kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``God forgive thee, insensible knight, for through thy cruelty I have been, to me it seems, more than a thousand years in the other world; and to thee, the most compassionate upon earth, I render thanks for the life I am now in possession of.
<p/>From this day forth, friend Sancho, count as thine six smocks of mine which I bestow upon thee, to make as many shirts for thyself, and if they are not all quite whole, at any rate they are all clean.
<p/>The duke bade them take it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cap and doublet and remove the flaming robe.
<p/>Sancho begged the duke to let them leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the robe and mitre; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wanted to take them home for a token and memento of that unexampled adventure.
<p/>The duchess said they must leave them with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knew already what a great friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was.
<p/>The duke then gave orders that the court should be cleared, and that all should retire to their chambers, and that Don Quixote and Sancho should be conducted to their old quarters.
<p/>long life to Altisidora! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Sancho kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) hands in gratitude, kneeling, and with the mitre in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) hand. CHAPTER LXX.
<p/>FOR THE CLEAR COMPREHENSION OF THIS HISTORY Sancho slept that night in a cot in the same chamber with Don Quixote, a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would have gladly excused if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could for he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) knew very well that with questions and answers his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sleep, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was in no humour for talking much, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) still felt the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) late martyrdom, which interfered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) freedom of speech; and it would have been more to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) taste to sleep in a hovel alone, than in that luxurious chamber in company.
<p/>And so well founded did his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) apprehension prove, and so correct was his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) anticipation, that scarcely had his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master got into bed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What dost thou think of to-night's adventure, Sancho?
<p/>Great and mighty is the power of cold-hearted scorn, for thou with thine own eyes hast seen Altisidora slain, not by arrows, nor by the sword, nor by any warlike weapon, nor by deadly poisons, but by the thought of the sternness and scorn with which I have always treated her (<font color='blue'><b>thine</b></font>).''

<p/>can I imagine how the recovery of Altisidora, a damsel more fanciful than wise, can have, as I have said before, anything to do with the sufferings of Sancho Panza.
<p/>Now I begin to see plainly and clearly that there are enchanters and enchanted people in the world; and may God deliver me from them, since I can't deliver myself; and so I beg of your worship to let me sleep and not ask me any more questions, unless you want me to throw myself out of the window.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No pain came up to the insult of the smacks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for the simple reason that it was duennas, confound them, that gave them to me; but once more I entreat your worship to let me sleep, for sleep is relief from misery to those who are miserable when awake.''

<p/>They fell asleep, both of them, and Cide Hamete, the author of this great history, took this opportunity to record and relate what it was that induced the duke and duchess to get up the elaborate plot that has been described.
<p/>The bachelor Samson Carrasco, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) says, not forgetting how he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) as the Knight of the Mirrors had been vanquished and overthrown by Don Quixote, which defeat and overthrow upset all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) plans, resolved to try his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand again, hoping for better luck than he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had before; and so, having learned where Don Quixote was from the page who brought the letter and present to Sancho's wife, Teresa Panza, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) got himself new armour and another horse, and put a white moon upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) shield, and to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) arms he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had a mule led by a peasant, not by Tom Cecial his (<font color='blue'><b>Cecial</b></font>) former squire for fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Cecial</b></font>) should be recognised by Sancho or Don Quixote.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) came to the duke's castle, and the duke informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) of the road and route Don Quixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at Saragossa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), too, of the jokes he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had practised upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and of the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho's backside; and finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) an account of the trick Sancho had played upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) believe that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) himself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which Don Quixote's madness went.
<p/>The duke begged of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) -LRB-whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) overcame him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) or not-RRB- to return that way and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) know the result.
<p/>This the bachelor did; he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) set out in quest of Don Quixote, and not finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) at Saragossa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went on, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) fared has been already told.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) returned to the duke's castle and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) promise of retiring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) might perhaps be cured of his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) madness; for that was the object that had led him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) to adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such good parts as Don Quixote to be a madman.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) leave of the duke, and went home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) village to wait there for Don Quixote, who was coming after him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>Thereupon the duke seized the opportunity of practising this mystification upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>); so much did he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) enjoy everything connected with Sancho and Don Quixote.
<p/>, everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) thought Don Quixote was likely to pass on his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) return, occupied by large numbers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) servants on foot and on horseback, who were to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to the castle, by fair means or foul, if they met him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>They did meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and sent word to the duke, who, having already settled what was to be done, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arrival, ordered the torches and lamps in the court to be lit and Altisidora to be placed on the catafalque with all the pomp and ceremony that has been described, the whole affair being so well arranged and acted that it differed but little from reality.
<p/>And Cide Hamete says, moreover, that for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) part he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) considers the concocters of the joke as crazy as the victims of it, and that the duke and duchess were not two fingers' breadth removed from being something like fools themselves when they took such pains to make game of a pair of fools.
<p/>As for the latter, one was sleeping soundly and the other lying awake occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) desultory thoughts, when daylight came to them bringing with it the desire to rise; for the lazy down was never a delight to Don Quixote, victor or vanquished.
<p/>Altisidora, come back from death to life as Don Quixote fancied, following up the freak of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) lord and lady, entered the chamber, crowned with the garland she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) had worn on the catafalque and in a robe of white taffeta embroidered with gold flowers, her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) hair flowing loose over her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) shoulders, and leaning upon a staff of fine black ebony.
<p/>Don Quixote, disconcerted and in confusion at her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) appearance, huddled himself up and well-nigh covered himself altogether with the sheets and counterpane of the bed, tongue-tied, and unable to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) any civility.
<p/>Altisidora seated herself on a chair at the head of the bed, and, after a deep sigh, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in a feeble, soft voice, <div class="bookquote">``When women of rank and modest maidens trample honour under foot, and give a loose to the tongue that breaks through every impediment, publishing abroad the inmost secrets of their hearts, they are reduced to sore extremities.
<p/>Such a one am I, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, crushed, conquered, love-smitten, but yet patient under suffering and virtuous, and so much so that my heart broke with grief
<p/>For the last two days I have been dead, slain by the thought of the cruelty with which thou hast treated me, obdurate knight, O harder thou than marble to my plaint; or at least believed to be dead by all who saw me; and had it not been that Love, taking pity on me, let my recovery rest upon the sufferings of this good squire, there I should have remained in the other world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Love might very well have let it rest upon the sufferings of my ass, and I should have been obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had the roads about the castle far and near and I lost my life. '' But tell me, senora--and may heaven send you a tenderer lover than my master
<p/>-what did you see in the other world? What goes on in hell? For of course that's where one who dies in despair is bound for.''
<p/>'' To tell you the truth,'' said Altisidora, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot have died outright, for I did not go into hell ; had I gone in, it is very certain
<p/>The truth is, I came to the gate, where some dozen or so of devils were playing tennis, all in breeches and doublets, with falling collars trimmed with Flemish bonelace, and ruffles of the same that served them for wristbands, with four fingers' breadth of the arms exposed to make their hands look longer; in their hands they held rackets of fire; but what amazed me still more was that books, apparently full of wind and rubbish, served them for tennis balls, a strange and marvellous thing; this, however, did not astonish me so much as to observe that, although with players it is usual for the winners to be glad and the losers sorry, there in that game all were growling, all were snarling, and all were cursing one another.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Altisidora</b></font>)</div><p/>I should never have come out again, do what I might. '' That's no wonder,'' said Sancho; ``for devils, whether playing or not, can never be content, win or lose.
<p/>I mean surprised me then, and that was that no ball outlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time; and it was wonderful the constant succession there was of books, new and old.
<p/>To one of them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke that they knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. '
<p/>Look what book that is,' said one devil to another, and the other replied, `It is the <div class="bookquote">``Second Part of the History of Don Quixote of La Mancha,''  (<font color='red'><b>devil</b></font>)</div>not by Cide Hamete, the original author, but by an Aragonese who by his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) own account is of Tordesillas.'
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Altisidora</b></font>)</div>said Altisidora; <div class="bookquote">``but there is another thing that surprises me too, ' Out of this with it,' said the first, `and into the depths of hell with it out of my sight.'
<p/>So bad is it,' said the first, `that if I had set myself deliberately to make a worse, I could not have done it.'
<p/>They then went on with their game, knocking other books about; and I, having heard them mention the name of Don Quixote whom I love and adore so, took care to retain this vision in my memory.
<p/>`Is it so bad?' said the other. ' ''  (<font color='red'><b>Altisidora</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A vision it must have been, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, ``for there is no other
<p/>I in the world; this history has been going about here for some time from hand to hand, but it does not stay long in any, for everybody gives it a taste of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) foot.
<p/>I am not disturbed by hearing that I am wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of the pit or in the daylight above, for I am not the one that history treats of.
<p/>If it should be good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; but if it should be bad, from its birth to its burial will not be a very long journey.
<p/>Altisidora was about to proceed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Altisidora</b></font>) complaint against Don Quixote, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Altisidora</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have several times told you, senora that it grieves me you should have set your affections upon me, as from mine they can only receive gratitude, but no return.
<p/>I was born to belong to Dulcinea del Toboso, and the fates, if there are any, dedicated me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Altisidora</b></font>); and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place she (<font color='blue'><b>Altisidora</b></font>) occupies in my heart is to suppose an impossibility.
<p/>This frank declaration should suffice to make you retire within the bounds of your modesty, for no one can bind himself to do impossibilities.
<p/>Don Stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of a date, more obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) mind made up, if I fall upon you
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' Hearing this, Altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``God's life! I'll tear your eyes out! Do you fancy, Don Vanquished, Don Cudgelled, that I died for your sake?
<p/>All that you have seen to-night has been make-believe; I'm not the woman to let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel, much less die!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Altisidora</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I can well believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for all that about lovers pining to death is absurd; they may talk of it, but as for doing it-Judas may believe that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>While they were talking, the musician, singer, and poet, who had sung the two stanzas given above came in, and making a profound obeisance to Don Quixote said, <div class="bookquote">``Will your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain me in the number of your most faithful servants, for I have long been a great admirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of your achievements?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will your worship tell me who you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>replied Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``so that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts?
<p/>Of a truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``your worship has a most excellent voice; but what you sang did not seem to me very much to the purpose; for what have Garcilasso's stanzas to do with the death of this lady?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be surprised at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the musician</b></font>)</div>returned the musician; <div class="bookquote">``for with the callow poets of our day the way is for every one to write as he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) pleases and pilfer where he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) chooses, whether it be germane to the matter or not, and now-a-days there is no piece of silliness they can sing or write that is not set down to poetic licence.
<p/>Don Quixote was about to reply, but was prevented by the duke and duchess, who came in to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and with them there followed a long and delightful conversation, in the course of which Sancho said so many droll and saucy things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) left the duke and duchess wondering not only at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) simplicity but at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) sharpness.
<p/>Don Quixote begged their permission to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) departure that same day, inasmuch as for a vanquished knight like himself it was fitter he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should live in a pig-sty than in a royal palace.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the musician</b></font>)</div>The young man replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the musician and songster of the night before. '' '' They gave it very readily, and the duchess asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if Altisidora was in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good graces.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Senora, let me tell your ladyship that this damsel's ailment comes entirely of idleness, and the cure for it is honest and constant employment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) herself has told me that lace is worn in hell; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) must know how to make it, let it never be out of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) hands
<p/>; for when she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) is occupied in shifting the bobbins to and fro, the image or images of what she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) loves will not shift to and fro in her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) thoughts; this is the truth, this is my opinion, and this is my advice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>added Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``for I never in all my life saw a lace-maker that died for love; when damsels are at work their minds are more set on finishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves.
<p/>I speak from my own experience; for when I'm digging I never think of my old woman; I mean my Teresa Panza, whom I love better than my own eyelids.
<p/>You say well, Sancho,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said the duchess, <div class="bookquote">``and I will take care that my Altisidora employs herself henceforward in needlework of some sort; for she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) is extremely expert at it.
<p/>There is no occasion to have recourse to that remedy, senora,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said Altisidora; <div class="bookquote">``for the mere thought of the cruelty with which this vagabond villain has treated me will suffice to blot him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) out of my memory without any other device; with your highness's leave I will retire, not to have before my eyes
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Altisidora</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' , I won't say his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) rueful countenance, but his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) abominable, ugly looks.'' '' That reminds me of the common saying, that `he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) that rails is ready to forgive,''' said the duke.
<p/>Altisidora then, pretending to wipe away her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) tears with a handkerchief, made an obeisance to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) master and mistress and quitted the room.
<p/>Thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a heart as hard as oak; had it been me, i`faith '
<p/>'' Ill luck betide thee, poor damsel,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``ill luck betide thee! another cock would have crowed to thee.' ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>So the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote dressed himself and dined with the duke and duchess, and set out the same evening.
<p/>CHAPTER LXXI. OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) SQUIRE SANCHO ON THE WAY TO THEIR VILLAGE The vanquished and afflicted Don Quixote went along very downcast in one respect and very happy in another.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sadness arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) defeat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in Sancho, as had been proved by the resurrection of Altisidora; though it was with difficulty he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) could persuade himself that the love-smitten damsel had been really dead.
<p/>Sancho went along anything but cheerful, for it grieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) that Altisidora had not kept her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) promise of giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) the smocks; and turning this over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``Surely, senor, I'm the most unlucky doctor in the world; there's many a physician that, after killing the sick man he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) had to cure, requires to be paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) work, though it is only signing a bit of a list of medicines, that the apothecary and not he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) makes up, and, there, his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) labour is over; but with me though to cure somebody else costs me drops of blood, smacks, pinches, pinproddings, and whippings, nobody gives me a farthing.
<p/>Well, I swear by all that's good if they put another patient into my hands, they'll have to grease them for me before I cure him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>); for, as they say, `it's by his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) singing the abbot gets his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) dinner,' and I'm not going to believe that heaven has bestowed upon me the virtue I have, that I should be dealing it out to others all for nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>Thou art right, Sancho my friend,'' said Don Quixote, ``and Altisidora has behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) promised; and although that virtue of thine is gratis data--as it has cost thee no study
<p/>whatever, any more than such study as thy personal sufferings may be--I can say for myself that if thou wouldst have payment for the lashes on account of the disenchant of Dulcinea, I would have given it to thee
<p/>I am not sure, however, whether payment will comport with the cure, and I would not have the reward interfere with the medicine.
<p/>I think there will be nothing lost by trying it; consider how much thou wouldst have, Sancho, and whip thyself at once, and pay thyself down with thine own hand, as thou hast money of mine.
<p/>At this proposal Sancho opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) ears a palm's breadth wide, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) heart very readily acquiesced in whipping himself, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``Very well then, senor, I'll hold myself in readiness to gratify your worship's wishes if I'm to profit by it; for the love of my wife and children forces me to seem grasping.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>freely ere this. '' Let your worship say how much you will pay me for each lash I give myself.''
<p/>If Sancho,'' replied Don Quixote, ``I were to requite thee as the importance and nature of the cure deserves, the treasures of Venice, the mines of Potosi, would be insufficient to pay thee.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``there are three thousand three hundred and odd; of these I have given myself five, the rest remain; let the five go for the odd ones, and let us take the three thousand three hundred, which at a quarter real apiece -LRB-for I will not take less though the whole world should bid me-RRB- make three thousand three hundred quarter reals; the three thousand are one thousand five hundred half reals, which make seven hundred and fifty reals; and the three hundred make a hundred and fifty half reals, which come to seventy-five reals, which added to the seven hundred and fifty make eight hundred and twenty-five reals in all.
<p/>These I will stop out of what I have belonging to your worship, and I'll return home rich and content, though well whipped, for `there's no taking trout'--but
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>See what thou hast of mine, and put a price on each lash.'' I say no more.'' <div class="bookquote">``O blessed Sancho!
<p/>O dear Sancho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``how we shall be bound to serve thee, Dulcinea and I, all the days of our lives that heaven may grant us!
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) lost shape -LRB-and it cannot be but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) will-RRB- her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) misfortune will have been good fortune, and my defeat a most happy triumph.
<p/>But look here, Sancho; when wilt thou begin the scourging? For if thou wilt make short work of it, I will give thee a hundred reals over and above.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Let your worship order it so that we pass it out of doors and in the open air, and I'll scarify myself.
<p/>Night, longed for by Don Quixote with the greatest anxiety in the world, came at last, though it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) that the wheels of Apollo's car had broken down, and that the day was drawing itself out longer than usual, just as is the case with lovers, who never make the reckoning of their desires agree with time.
<p/>They made their way at length in among some pleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road, and there vacating Rocinante's saddle and Dapple's pack-saddle, they stretched themselves on the green grass and made their supper off Sancho's stores, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) making a powerful and flexible whip out of Dapple's halter and headstall retreated about twenty paces from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) master among some beech trees.
<p/>Don Quixote seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) march off with such resolution and spirit, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Take care, my friend, not to cut thyself to pieces; allow the lashes to wait for one another, and do not be in so great a hurry as to run thyself out of breath midway; I mean, do not lay on so strenuously as to make thy life fail thee before thou hast reached the desired number; and that thou mayest not lose by a card too much or too little, I will station myself apart and count on my rosary here the lashes thou givest thyself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>''`Pledges don't distress a good payer,''' said Sancho; ``I mean to lay on in such a way as without killing myself to hurt myself, for in that, no doubt, lies the essence of this miracle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) then stripped himself from the waist upwards, and snatching up the rope he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) began to lay on and Don Quixote to count the lashes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might have given himself six or eight when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) began to think the joke no trifle, and its price very low; and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) hand for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) master that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) cried off on the score of a blind bargain, for each of those lashes ought to be paid for at the rate of half a real instead of a quarter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``this night without fail. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>May heaven help thee as thy good intention deserves.

<p/>Don Quixote, touched to the heart, and fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might make an end of himself, and that through Sancho's imprudence he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might miss his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own object, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``As thou livest, my friend, let the matter rest where it is, for the remedy seems to me a very rough one, and it will be well to have patience; `Zamora was not won in an hour.'
<p/>If I have not reckoned wrong thou hast given thyself over a thousand lashes; that is enough for the present; `for the ass,' to put it in homely phrase, `bears the load, but not the overload.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' In that case,'' said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``in God's hand be it, and let it rain lashes.

<p/>, the arms broken;' go back a little further, your worship, and let me give myself at any rate a thousand lashes more; for in a couple of bouts like this we shall have finished off the lot, and there will be even cloth to spare.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' As thou art in such a willing mood,'' said Don Quixote, ``may heaven aid thee; lay on and I'll retire.
<p/>Sancho returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) task with so much resolution that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) soon had the bark stripped off several trees, such was the severity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) whipped himself; and one time, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) voice, and giving a beech a tremendous lash, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Here dies Samson, and all with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) piteous cry and of the stroke of the cruel lash, Don Quixote ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) at once, and seizing the twisted halter that served him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) for a courbash, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid, Sancho my friend, that to please me thou shouldst lose thy life, which is needed for the support of thy wife and children; let Dulcinea wait for a better opportunity, and I will content myself with a hope soon to be realised, and have patience until thou hast gained fresh strength so as to finish off this business to the satisfaction of everybody.
<p/>As your worship will have it so, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, ``so be it; but throw your cloak over my shoulders, for I'm sweating
<p/>Don Quixote obeyed, and stripping himself covered Sancho, who slept until the sun woke him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>); they then resumed their journey, which for the time being they brought to an end at a village that lay three leagues farther on.
<p/>They dismounted at a hostelry which Don Quixote recognised as such and did not take to be a castle with moat, turrets, portcullis, and drawbridge; for ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had been vanquished he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) talked more rationally about everything, as will be shown presently.
<p/>They quartered him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in a room on the ground floor, where in place of leather hangings there were pieces of painted serge such as they commonly use in villages.
<p/>On one of them was painted by some very poor hand the Rape of Helen, when the bold guest carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) off from Menelaus, and on the other was the story of Dido and AEneas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dido</b></font>) on a high tower, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dido</b></font>) were making signals with a half sheet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dido</b></font>) fugitive guest who was out at sea flying in a frigate or brigantine.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) noticed in the two stories that Helen did not go very reluctantly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was laughing slyly and roguishly; but the fair Dido was shown dropping tears the size of walnuts from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dido</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Don Quixote as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) looked at them observed, <div class="bookquote">``Those two ladies were very unfortunate not to have been born in this age, and I unfortunate above all men not to have been born in theirs.
<p/>Had I fallen in with those gentlemen, Troy would not have been burned or Carthage destroyed, for it would have been only for me to slay Paris, and all these misfortunes would have been avoided.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll lay a bet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``that before long there won't be a tavern, roadside inn, hostelry, or barber's shop where the story of our doings won't be painted up; but I'd like it painted by the hand of a better painter than painted these.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>Thou art right, Sancho,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``for this painter is like Orbaneja, a painter there was at Ubeda, who when they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was painting, used to say, `Whatever it may turn out; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chanced to paint a cock he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) would write under it, `This is a cock,' for fear they might think it was a fox.
<p/>The painter or writer, for it's all the same, who published the history of this new Don Quixote that has come out, must have been one of this sort I think, Sancho, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) painted or wrote `whatever it might turn out;' or perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) is like a poet called Mauleon that was about the Court some years ago, who used to answer at haphazard whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was asked, and on one asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) what Deum de Deo meant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) replied De donde diere.
<p/>But, putting this aside, tell me, Sancho, hast thou a mind to have another turn at thyself to-night, and wouldst thou rather have it indoors or in the open air?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Egad, senor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``for what I'm going to give myself, it comes all the same to me whether it is in a house or in the fields; still I'd like it to be among trees; for I think they are company for me and help me to bear my pain wonderfully.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' '' and I don't want to take cold; it's a risk that novice disciplinants run. '' '' '' ''
<p/>And yet it must not be, Sancho my friend,'' said Don Quixote; ``but, to enable thee to recover strength, we must keep it for our own village; for at the latest we shall get there the day after to-morrow.
<p/>Sancho said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) might do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pleased; but that for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) own part he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would like to finish off the business quickly before his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) blood cooled and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had an appetite, because <div class="bookquote">``in delay there is apt to be danger''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>very often, and <div class="bookquote">``praying to God and plying the hammer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``one take was better than two

<p/>thou art becoming sicut erat again; speak in a plain, simple, straight-forward way, as I have often told thee, and thou wilt find the good of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what bad luck it is of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``but I can't utter a word without a proverb that is not as good as an argument to my mind; however, I mean to mend if I can;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>and so for the present the conversation ended.
<p/>All that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and inn waiting for night, the one to finish off his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) task of scourging in the open country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay the accomplishment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) wishes.
<p/>Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a traveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said to him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) who appeared to be the master, <div class="bookquote">``Here, Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe, your worship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and cool.

<p/>The newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, and coming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and cool, addressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``In what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?''

<p/>To which Don Quixote returned, <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt whatever that your worship is that Don Alvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second Part of the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and published by a new author.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>replied the gentleman; <div class="bookquote">``and that same Don Quixote, the principal personage in the said history, was a very great friend of mine, and it was I who took him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) away from home, or at least induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa, whither I was going myself
<p/>; indeed, I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) many kindnesses, and saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) from having his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shoulders touched up by the executioner because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) extreme rashness.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I can well believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho at this, ``for to come out with drolleries is not in everybody's line; and that Sancho your worship speaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel, dunderhead, and thief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I have more drolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try; come along with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me at every turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don't know what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh.
<p/>And the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, the lover, the righter of wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, the protector of widows, the killer of damsels, he (<font color='blue'><b>killer</b></font>) who has for his (<font color='blue'><b>killer</b></font>) sole mistress the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, is this gentleman before you, my master; all other Don Quixotes and all other Sancho Panzas are dreams and mockeries.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By God I believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Alvaro/Don Alvaro Tarfe/Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe</b></font>)</div>said Don Alvaro; <div class="bookquote">``for you have uttered more drolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than the other Sancho Panza in all I ever heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>), and they were not a few.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) was more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and I am convinced that the enchanters who persecute Don Quixote the Good have been trying to persecute me with Don Quixote the Bad.
<p/>But I don't know what to say, for I am ready to swear I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) shut up in the Casa del Nuncio at Toledo, and here another Don Quixote turns up, though a very different one from mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Alvaro/Don Alvaro Tarfe/Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether I am good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``but I can safely say I am not `the Bad;' and to prove it, let me tell you, Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe, I have never in my life been in Saragossa
<p/>; so far from that, when it was told me that this imaginary Don Quixote had been present at the jousts in that city, I declined to enter it, in order to drag his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) falsehood before the face of the world; and so I went on straight to Barcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, haven of strangers, asylum of the poor, home of the valiant, champion of the wronged, pleasant exchange of firm friendships, and city unrivalled in site and beauty.
<p/>And though the adventures that befell me there are not by any means matters of enjoyment, but rather of regret, I do not regret them, simply because I have seen it.
<p/>In a word, Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe, I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, the one that fame speaks of, and not the unlucky one that has attempted to usurp my name and deck himself out in my ideas.
<p/>I entreat your worship by your devoir as a gentleman to be so good as to make a declaration before the alcalde of this village that you never in all your life saw me until now, and that neither am I the Don Quixote in print in the Second Part, nor this Sancho Panza, my squire, the one your worship knew.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I will do most willingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Alvaro/Don Alvaro Tarfe/Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe</b></font>)</div>replied Don Alvaro; <div class="bookquote">``though it amazes me to find two Don Quixotes and two Sancho Panzas at once, as much alike in name as they differ in demeanour; and again I say and declare that what I saw I cannot have seen, and that what happened me cannot have happened.''

<p/>Sancho replied that it was a long story to tell, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) if they happened to be going the same road.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had,'' said Don Alvaro; '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand that about the lashes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Alvaro/Don Alvaro Tarfe/Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe</b></font>)</div>said Don Alvaro. By this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don Alvaro dined together.
<p/>The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together with a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), showing that it was requisite for his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rights that Don Alvaro Tarfe, the gentleman there present, should make a declaration before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tarfe</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tarfe</b></font>) did not know Don Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was not the one that was in print in a history entitled ``Second Part of Don Quixote of La Mancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.
<p/>The alcalde finally put it in legal form, and the declaration was made with all the formalities required in such cases, at which Don Quixote and Sancho were in high delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance to them, and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the difference between the two Don Quixotes and the two Sanchos.
<p/>Many civilities and offers of service were exchanged by Don Alvaro and Don Quixote, in the course of which the great Manchegan displayed such good taste that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) disabused Don Alvaro of the error he (<font color='blue'><b>Alvaro</b></font>) was under; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alvaro</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alvaro</b></font>) part, felt convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Alvaro</b></font>) must have been enchanted, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alvaro</b></font>) had been brought in contact with two such opposite Don Quixotes.
<p/>Evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a league two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote's village, the other the road Don Alvaro was to follow.
<p/>In this short interval Don Quixote told him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea's enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don Alvaro into fresh amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) way, and Don Quixote went his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>That night he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) passed among trees again in order to give Sancho an opportunity of working out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) penance, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) did in the same fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech trees much more than of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) back, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) took such good care that the lashes would not have knocked off a fly
<p/>The duped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of the count, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) found that together with those of the night before they made up three thousand and twenty-nine.
<p/>The sun apparently had got up early to witness the sacrifice, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) light they resumed their journey, discussing the deception practised on Don Alvaro, and saying how well done it was to have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Alvaro</b></font>) declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable form.
<p/>That day and night they travelled on, nor did anything worth mention happen to them, unless it was that in the course of the night Sancho finished off his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) task, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure joyful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) watched for daylight, to see if along the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should fall in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) already disenchanted lady Dulcinea; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) journey there was no woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) met that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) did not go up to, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was Dulcinea del Toboso, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) held it absolutely certain that Merlin's promises could not lie.
<p/>Full of these thoughts and anxieties, they ascended a rising ground wherefrom they descried their own village, at the sight of which Sancho fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) knees exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Open thine eyes, longed-for home, and see how thy son Sancho Panza comes back to thee, if not very rich, very well whipped!
<p/>Open thine arms and receive, too, thy son Don Quixote, who, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) comes vanquished by the arm of another, comes victor over himself, which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) himself has told me, is the greatest victory anyone can desire.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>had there been one there. I'm bringing back money, for if I was well whipped, I went mounted like a gentleman.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have done with these fooleries,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``let us push on straight and get to our own place, where we will give free range to our fancies, and settle our plans for our future pastoral life.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>With this they descended the slope and directed their steps to their village. CHAPTER LXXIII. OF THE OMENS DON QUIXOTE HAD
<p/>At the entrance of the village, so says Cide Hamete, Don Quixote saw two boys quarrelling on the village threshing-floor, one of whom said to the other, ``Take it easy, Periquillo; thou shalt never see it again as long as thou livest.
<p/>Don Quixote heard this, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``Dost thou not mark, friend, what that boy said, `Thou shalt never see it again as long as thou livest'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div><p/>AS HE (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ENTERED HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) OWN VILLAGE, AND OTHER INCIDENTS THAT EMBELLISH AND GIVE A COLOUR TO THIS GREAT HISTORY '' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``dost thou not see that, applied to the object of my desires, the words mean that I am never to see Dulcinea more?
<p/>Sancho was about to answer, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) attention was diverted by seeing a hare come flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds and sportsmen.
<p/>Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Sancho, <div class="bookquote">``what does it matter if the boy said so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>'' In its terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself under Dapple.
<p/>Sancho caught it alive and presented it to Don Quixote, who was saying, <div class="bookquote">``Malum signum, malum signum! a hare flies, greyhounds chase it, Dulcinea appears not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div><p/>Your worship's a strange man,'' said Sancho; ``let's take it for granted that this hare is Dulcinea, and these greyhounds chasing it the malignant enchanters who turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) into a country wench; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) flies, and I catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) into your worship's hands, and you hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>) in your arms and cherish her (<font color='blue'><b>Dulcinea</b></font>); what bad sign is that, or what ill omen is there to be found here?
<p/>The two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare, and Sancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) was answered by the one who had said, <div class="bookquote">``Thou shalt never see it again as long as thou livest,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had taken a cage full of crickets from the other boy, and did not mean to give it back to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lived.
<p/>Sancho took out four cuartos from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) pocket and gave them to the boy for the cage, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) placed in Don Quixote's hands, saying, <div class="bookquote">``There, senor!
<p/>there are the omens broken and destroyed, and they have no more to do with our affairs, to my thinking, fool as I am, than with last year's clouds; and if I remember rightly I have heard the curate of our village say that it does not become Christians or sensible people to give any heed to these silly things; and
<p/>even you yourself said the same to me some time ago, telling me that all Christians who minded omens were fools; but there's no need of making words about it; let us push on and go into our village.
<p/>They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town they came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with their breviaries.
<p/>It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown, by way of a sumpter-cloth, over Dapple and over the bundle of armour, the buckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) at the duke's castle the night Altisidora came back to life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) had also fixed the mitre on Dapple's head, the oddest transformation and decoration that ever ass in the world underwent.

<p/>Don Quixote dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the boys, who are lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass's mitre and came running to see it, calling out to one another, ``Come here, boys, and see Sancho Panza's ass figged out finer than Mingo, and Don Quixote's beast leaner than ever.
<p/>So at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by the curate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, and proceeded to Don Quixote's house, at the door of which they found his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) housekeeper and niece, whom the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) arrival had already reached.
<p/>It had been brought to Teresa Panza, Sancho's wife, as well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) hair all loose and half naked, dragging Sanchica her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) daughter by the hand, ran out to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) husband; but seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) coming in by no means as good case as she (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) thought a governor ought to be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``How is it you come this way, husband?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It seems to me you come tramping and footsore, and looking more like a disorderly vagabond than a governor.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, Teresa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho; <div class="bookquote">``often `where there are pegs there are no flitches;' let's go into the house
<p/>and there you'll hear strange things. I bring money, and that's the main thing, got by my own industry without wronging anybody.''

<p/>Sanchica embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) father and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) anything, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) had been looking out for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as for the showers of May; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Teresa</b></font>) taking hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by the girdle on one side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife by the hand, while the daughter led Dapple, they made for their house, leaving Don Quixote in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), in the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) niece and housekeeper, and in the company of the curate and the bachelor.
<p/>Don Quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew in private with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them of his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) defeat, and of the engagement he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was under not to quit his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) village for a year, which he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) meant to keep to the letter without departing a hair's breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by scrupulous good faith and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) thought of turning shepherd for that year, and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) diversion in the solitude of the fields, where he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) could with perfect freedom give range to his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) thoughts of love while he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) followed the virtuous pastoral calling; and he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) besought them, if they had not a great deal to do and were not prevented by more important business, to consent to be his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) companions, for he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) would buy sheep enough to qualify them for shepherds; and the most important point of the whole affair, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) could tell them, was settled, for he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) had given them names that would fit them to a T.
<p/>Don Quixote replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) himself was to be called the shepherd Quixotize and the bachelor the shepherd Carrascon, and the curate the shepherd Curambro, and Sancho Panza the shepherd Pancino.
<p/>Both were astounded at Don Quixote's new craze; however, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) should once more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) chivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) might be cured, fell in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) new project, applauded his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) crazy idea as a bright one, and offered to share the life with him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>And what's more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teresa/Teresa Panza/TERESA PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Samson Carrasco, <div class="bookquote">``I am, as all the world knows, a very famous poet, and I'll be always making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or as it may come into my head, to pass away our time in those secluded regions where we shall be roaming.
<p/>But what is most needful, sirs, is that each of us should choose the name of the shepherdess he (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) means to glorify in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carrasco</b></font>) verses, and that we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard, without writing up and carving her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) name on it, as is the habit and custom of love-smitten shepherds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><p/>That's the very thing,'' said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``though I am relieved from looking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for there's the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory of these brooksides, the ornament of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the cream of all the graces, and,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>The curate asked what they were. '' '' in a word, the being to whom all praise is appropriate, be it ever so hyperbolical.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>said the curate; <div class="bookquote">``but we the others must look about for accommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way or another.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>And,'' added Samson Carrasco, <div class="bookquote">``if they fail us, we can call them by the names of the ones in print that the world is filled with, Filidas, Amarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as they sell them in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our own.
<p/>If my lady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called Ana, I'll sing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ana</b></font>) praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca, I'll call her (<font color='blue'><b>Ana</b></font>) Francenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to the same thing; and Sancho Panza, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) joins this fraternity, may glorify his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) wife Teresa Panza as Teresaina.
<p/>Don Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate bestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had made, and again offered to bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) company all the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) could spare from his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) imperative duties.
<p/>And so they took their leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), recommending and beseeching him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to take care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) health and treat himself to a suitable diet.
<p/>It so happened his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three of them said; and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in to Don Quixote, and said the niece,
<p/>Now that we were thinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quiet respectable life there, are you going to get into fresh entanglements, and turn `young shepherd, thou that comest here, young shepherd going there?'
<p/>And,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>added the housekeeper, <div class="bookquote">``will your worship be able to bear, out in the fields, the heats of summer, and the chills of winter, and the howling of the wolves?
<p/>Not you; for that's a life and a business for hardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from the time they were in swaddling-clothes.

(<font color='red'><b>a shepherd</b></font>)</div>'' Why, to make choice of evils, it's better to be a knight-errant than a shepherd!
<p/>Look here, senor; take my advice--and I'm not giving it to you full of bread and wine, but fasting, and with fifty years upon my head--stay at home, look after your affairs, go often to confession, be good to the poor, and upon my soul be it if any evil comes to you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your peace, my daughters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>said Don Quixote; <div class="bookquote">``I know very well what my duty is; help me to bed, for I don't feel very well; and rest assured that, knight-errant now or wandering shepherd to be, I shall never fail to have a care for your interests, as you will see in the end.
<p/>And the good wenches -LRB-for that they undoubtedly were-RRB-, the housekeeper and niece, helped him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) to bed, where they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) something to eat and made him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) as comfortable as possible.
<p/>HOW HE (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) DIED As nothing that is man's can last for ever, but all tends ever downwards from its beginning to its end, and above all man's life, and as Don Quixote's enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to stay its course, its end and close came when he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) least looked for it.
<p/>For whether it was of the dejection the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) defeat produced, or of heaven's will that so ordered it--a fever settled upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) and kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bed for six days, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was often visited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) friends the curate, the bachelor, and the barber, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) good squire Sancho Panza never quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) bedside.
<p/>They, persuaded that it was grief at finding himself vanquished, and the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) heart, the liberation and disenchantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) in this state, strove by all the means in their power to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) up; the bachelor bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) take heart and get up to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) pastoral life, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) said, had already composed an eclogue that would take the shine out of all Sannazaro had ever written, and had bought with his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) own money two famous dogs to guard the flock, one called Barcino and the other Butron, which a herdsman of Quintanar had sold him (<font color='blue'><b>herdsman</b></font>).

OF HOW DON QUIXOTE FELL SICK, AND OF THE WILL HE (<font color='blue'><b>QUIXOTE</b></font>) MADE, AND But for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) sadness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) friends called in the doctor, who felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) pulse and was not very well satisfied with it, and said that in any case it would be well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to attend to the health of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) soul, as that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) body was in a bad way.
<p/>Don Quixote heard this calmly; but not so his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) housekeeper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) niece, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) squire, who fell weeping bitterly, as if they had him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lying dead before them.
<p/>The doctor's opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) end. Don Quixote begged them to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had a wish to sleep a little.
<p/>They obeyed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) slept at one stretch, as the saying is, more than six hours, so that the housekeeper and niece thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was going to sleep for ever.
<p/>But at the end of that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) woke up, and in a loud voice exclaimed, ``Blessed be Almighty God, who has shown me such goodness.
<p/>The niece listened with attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle's words, and they struck her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) as more coherent than what usually fell from him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), at least during his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) illness, so she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``What are you saying, senor?
<p/>In truth his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mercies are boundless, and the sins of men can neither limit them nor keep them back!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Has anything strange occurred?
<p/>The mercies, niece,'' said Don Quixote, <div class="bookquote">``are those that God has this moment shown me, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), as I said
<p/>My reason is now free and clear, rid of the dark shadows of ignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable books of chivalry cast over it.
<p/>Now I see through their absurdities and deceptions, and it only grieves me that this destruction of my illusions has come so late that it leaves me no time to make some amends by reading other books that might be a light to my soul.
<p/>Niece, I feel myself at the point of death, and I would fain meet it in such a way as to show that my life has not been so ill that I should leave behind me the name of a madman
<p/>What mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Quixote/DON QUIXOTE/Senor Don Quixote</b></font>)</div>'' , my sins are no impediment to them. ; for though I have been one, I would not that the fact should be made plainer at my death.
<p/>Call in to me, my dear, my good friends the curate, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, and Master Nicholas the barber, for I wish to confess and make my will.
<p/>The instant Don Quixote saw them he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) exclaimed, ``Good news for you, good sirs, that I am no longer Don Quixote of La Mancha, but Alonso Quixano, whose way of life won for him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixano</b></font>) the name of Good.
<p/>Now am I the enemy of Amadis of Gaul and of the whole countless troop of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gaul</b></font>) descendants; odious to me now are all the profane stories of knight-errantry; now I perceive my folly, and the peril into which reading them brought me; now, by God's mercy schooled into my right senses, I loathe them.
<p/>When the three heard him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) speak in this way, they had no doubt whatever that some new craze had taken possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and said Samson, <div class="bookquote">``What?
<p/>Now that we have intelligence of the lady Dulcinea being disenchanted, are you taking this line; now, just as we are on the point of becoming shepherds, to pass our lives singing, like princes, are you thinking of turning hermit?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) niece was saved the trouble by the entrance of the three. '' Senor Don Quixote! Hush, for heaven's sake, be rational and let's have no more nonsense.
<p/>All that nonsense,'' said Don Quixote, ``that until now has been a reality to my hurt, my death will, with heaven's help, turn to my good.
<p/>I feel, sirs, that I am rapidly drawing near death; a truce to jesting; let me have a confessor to confess me, and a notary to make my will; for in extremities like this, man must not trifle with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul; and while the curate is confessing me let some one, I beg, go for the notary.
<p/>They looked at one another, wondering at Don Quixote's words; but, though uncertain, they were inclined to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>), and one of the signs by which they came to the conclusion he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was dying was this so sudden and complete return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) senses after having been mad; for to the words already quoted he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) added much more, so well expressed, so devout, and so rational, as to banish all doubt and convince them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was sound of mind.
<p/>The bachelor went for the notary and returned shortly afterwards with him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) and with Sancho, who, having already learned from the bachelor the condition his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) master was in, and finding the housekeeper and niece weeping, began to blubber and shed tears.
<p/>The confession over, the curate came out saying, ``Alonso Quixano the Good is indeed dying, and is indeed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alonso</b></font>) right mind; we may now go in to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alonso</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Alonso</b></font>) makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Alonso</b></font>) will.
<p/>This news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the housekeeper, niece, and Sancho Panza his (<font color='blue'><b>Panza</b></font>) good squire, making the tears burst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of a truth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixano the Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don Quixote was always of a gentle disposition and kindly in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ways, and hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) was beloved, not only by those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) own house, but by all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>).
<p/>The notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the will had been set out and Don Quixote had commended his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) soul to God with all the devout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests, he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Item, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in the hands of Sancho Panza -LRB-whom in my madness I made my squire-RRB-, inasmuch as between him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) and me there have been certain accounts and debits and credits, no claim be made against him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), nor any account demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) in respect of them; but that if anything remain over and above, after he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) has paid himself what I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), the balance, which will be but little, shall be his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), and much good may it do him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>); and if, as when I was mad
<p/>I had a share in giving him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) the government of an island, so, now that I am in my senses, I could give him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) that of a kingdom
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' The curate turned them all out, and left alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) confessed him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>). '' , it should be his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>), for the simplicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) character and the fidelity of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) conduct deserve it.
<p/>And then, turning to Sancho, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, my friend, that I led thee to seem as mad as myself, making thee fall into the same error I myself fell into, that there were and still are knights-errant in the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>said Sancho weeping, <div class="bookquote">``don't die, master, but take my advice and live many years; for the foolishest thing a man can do in this life is to let himself die without rhyme or reason, without anybody killing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or any hands but melancholy's making an end of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Come, don't be lazy, but get up from your bed and let us take to the fields in shepherd's trim as we agreed.
<p/>If it be that you are dying of vexation at having been vanquished, lay the blame on me, and say you were overthrown because I had girthed Rocinante badly; besides you must have seen in your books of chivalry that it is a common thing for knights to upset one another, and for him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) who is conquered to-day to be conqueror to-morrow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sancho/Sancho Panza/SANCHO PANZA</b></font>)</div>Perhaps behind some bush we shall find the lady Dulcinea disenchanted, as fine as fine can be. '' <div class="bookquote">``Very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div>said Samson, <div class="bookquote">``and good Sancho Panza's view of these cases is quite right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samson/Samson Carrasco/Carrasco</b></font>)</div><p/>I was mad, now I am in my senses; I was Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am now, as I said, Alonso Quixano the Good; and may my repentance and sincerity restore me to the esteem you used to have for me; and now let Master Notary proceed.
<p/>Item, I leave all my property absolutely to Antonia Quixana my niece, here present, after all has been deducted from the most available portion of it that may be required to satisfy the bequests I have made.
<p/>And the first disbursement I desire to be made is the payment of the wages I owe for the time my housekeeper has served me, with twenty ducats, over and above, for a gown.
<p/>'' Sirs, not so fast,'' said Don Quixote, ''`in last year's nests there are no birds this year. ' '' The curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, now present, I appoint my executors.
<p/>Item, it is my wish that if Antonia Quixana, my niece, desires to marry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Quixana</b></font>) shall marry a man of whom it shall be first of all ascertained by information taken that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not know what books of chivalry are; and if it should be proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does, and if, in spite of this, my niece insists upon marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and does marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), then that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) shall forfeit the whole of what I have left her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), which my executors shall devote to works of charity as they please.
<p/>Item, I entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors, that, if any happy chance should lead them to discover the author who is said to have written a history now going about under the title of `Second Part of the Achievements of Don Quixote of La Mancha,' they beg of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) on my behalf as earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been, without intending it, the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) writing so many and such monstrous absurdities as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) has written in it; for I am leaving the world with a feeling of compunction at having provoked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) to write them.
<p/>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) will, and a faintness coming over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) stretched himself out at full length on the bed.
<p/>All were in a flutter and made haste to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>), and during the three days he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) lived after that on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) will he (<font color='blue'><b>Mancha</b></font>) fainted away very often.
<p/>The house was all in confusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank and Sancho Panza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out or softens down in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be expected to leave behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>At last Don Quixote's end came, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) had received all the sacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) detestation of books of chivalry.
<p/>The notary was there at the time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) said that in no book of chivalry had he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) ever read of any knight-errant dying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears and lamentations of all present yielded up his (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) spirit, that is to say died.
<p/>On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) achievements.
<p/>Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) and claim him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer.
<p/>The lamentations of Sancho and the niece and housekeeper are omitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Sancho</b></font>) tomb; Samson Carrasco, however, put the following lines: A doughty gentleman lies here;
<p/>A stranger all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life to fear; Nor in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) death could Death prevail, In that last hour, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quail.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for the world but little cared; And at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feats the world was scared; A crazy man his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) passed, But in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) senses died at last.
<p/>And said most sage Cide Hamete to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pen, <div class="bookquote">``Rest here, hung up by this brass wire, upon this shelf, O my pen, whether of skilful make or clumsy cut
<p/>I know not; here shalt thou remain long ages hence, unless presumptuous or malignant story-tellers take thee down to profane thee.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cide Hamete/Hamete Benengeli/Cide Hamete Benengeli</b></font>)</div>'' '' But ere they touch thee warn them, and, as best thou canst, say to them: Hold off! ye weaklings; hold your hands!

<p/>, thou shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the weary mouldering bones of Don Quixote, and not to attempt to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) off, in opposition to all the privileges of death, to Old Castile, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) rise from the grave where in reality and truth he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) lies stretched at full length, powerless to make any third expedition or new sally; for the two that he (<font color='blue'><b>Quixote</b></font>) has already made, so much to the enjoyment and approval of everybody to whom they have become known, in this as well as in foreign countries, are quite sufficient for the purpose of turning into ridicule the whole of those made by the whole set of the knights-errant; and so doing shalt thou discharge thy Christian calling, giving good counsel to one that bears ill-will to thee.
<p/>And I shall remain satisfied, and proud to have been the first who has ever enjoyed the fruit of his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) writings as fully as he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) could desire; for my desire has been no other than to deliver over to the detestation of mankind the false and foolish tales of the books of chivalry, which, thanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even now tottering, and doubtless doomed to fall for ever.
