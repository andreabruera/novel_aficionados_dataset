THE CAREW MURDER CASE Nearly a year later , in the month of October , 18 -- , London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim . '' ","i":7453},{"w":"`` If you will come with me in my cab , '' ","i":8426},{"w":"`` I think I can take you to his house . A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven , but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours ; so that as the cab crawled from street to street , Mr. Utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight ; for here it would be dark like the back-end of evening ; and there would be a glow of a rich , lurid brown , like the light of some strange conflagration ; and here , for a moment , the fog would be quite broken up , and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths . The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses , with its muddy ways , and slatternly passengers , and its lamps , which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness , seemed , in the lawyer 's eyes , like a district of some city in a nightmare . The thoughts of his mind , besides , were of the gloomiest dye ; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive , he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law 's officers , which may at times assail the most honest . As the cab drew up before the address indicated , the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street , a gin palace , a low French eating house , a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads , many ragged children huddled in the doorways , and many women of many different nationalities passing out , key in hand , to have a morning glass ; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part , as brown as umber , and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings . This was the home of Henry Jekyll 's favourite ; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling . '' ","i":8441},{"w":"`` I have him in my hand . Why , money 's life to the man . This last , however , was not so easy of accomplishment ; for Mr. Hyde had numbered few familiars -- even the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice ; his family could nowhere be traced ; he had never been photographed ; and the few who could describe him differed widely , as common observers will . Only on one point were they agreed ; and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders . We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank , and get out the handbills . '' ","i":9305},{"w":"`` it 's a very interesting autograph .

Yes , it was disappearance ; here again , as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author , here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted . But in the will , that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde ; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible . A great curiosity came on the trustee , to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries ; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations ; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe . It is one thing to mortify curiosity , another to conquer it ; and it may be doubted if , from that day forth , Utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness .

There is my explanation ; it is sad enough , Poole , ay , and appalling to consider ; but it is plain and natural , hangs well together , and delivers us from all exorbitant alarms .

The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre , which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above , and by the cabinet , which formed an upper story at one end and looked upon the court . A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street ; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs . Each closet needed but a glance , for all were empty , and all , by the dust that fell from their doors , had stood long unopened . The cellar , indeed , was filled with crazy lumber , mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll 's predecessor ; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search , by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance .
