an analysis in was positive about the plot considered the novel one of the few by christie that is well anchored in time and place story that knows it describes the end of an era and mentions that the plot is clever
christie had not mastered cleverness in her first novel as too many clues tend to cancel each other out this was judged difficulty which conan doyle never satisfactorily overcame but which christie would
the character of hercule_poirot was inspired by her experience working as nurse ministering to belgian soldiers during the first world war and by belgian refugees who were living in torquay
agatha christie began working on the mysterious affair at styles in writing most of it on dartmoor the manuscript was rejected by hodder and stoughton and methuen
after keeping the submission for several months the bodley head founder mr_john_cavendish lane at the bodley head offered to accept it provided that christie make slight changes to the ending
christie then submitted the manuscript to the bodley head she revised the next to last chapter changing the scene of hercule_poirot grand revelation from courtroom to the styles library
the mysterious affair at styles was published by mr_john_cavendish lane in the united states in october and by the bodley head in the united kingdom on january

meanwhile emily ate little at dinner and retired early to her room taking her document case with her when her body was found the case had been forced open and document removed
mr_alfred_inglethorp left the manor early that evening and stayed overnight in the village nobody can explain how or when the poison was administered to her
inspector japp the investigating officer considers mr_alfred_inglethorp to be the prime suspect as he gains the most from his wife death
hercule_poirot notes his behaviour is suspicious during the investigation he refuses to provide an alibi and openly denies purchasing the strychnine in the village despite evidence to the contrary
although japp is keen to arrest him hercule_poirot intervenes by proving he couldnt have purchased the poison the signature for the purchase is not in his handwriting

the cavendishes suspect him to be fortune hunter as he was much younger than emily hercule_poirot soon exonerates mr_john_cavendish of the crime
he reveals that the murder was committed by mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp with aid from his cousin evelyn_howard the pair pretended to be enemies but were romantically involved
the pair then left false evidence that would incriminate mr_alfred_inglethorp which they knew would be refuted at his trial once acquitted he could not be tried for the crime again if genuine evidence against him was found per the law of double jeopardy
mr_john_cavendish was framed by the pair as part of their plan his handwriting was forged by evelyn_howard and the evidence against him was fabricated
hercule_poirot reveals that when he realised that mr_alfred_inglethorp wanted to be arrested he prevented japp from doing so until he could discover why
he also reveals that he found letter in emily room thanks to chance remark by mr_hastings that detailed mr_alfred_inglethorp intentions for his wife
emily distress on the afternoon of the murder was because she had found it in his desk while searching for stamps
her case was forced open by mr_alfred_inglethorp as he had discovered she had taken it he was forced to recover it from the case and he hid it in the room as he couldnt be found with it

mademoiselle_cynthia murdoch the daughter of deceased friend of the family an orphan she performs war time work at nearby hospital pharmacy
dr_bauerstein a well known toxicologist living not far from styles the book dedication reads to my mother christie mother clarissa clara
boehmer miller was strong influence on her life and someone to whom christie was extremely close especially after the death of her father in
it was while christie was ill circa that her mother suggested she write story the result was the house of beauty now lost work which hesitantly started her writing career
christie later revised this story as the house of dreams and it was published in issue of the sovereign magazine in january and many years later in in book form in while the light lasts and other stories
the time literary supplement february gave the book an enthusiastic if short review which stated the only fault this story has is that it is almost too ingenious
christie also dedicated her debut novel as mary_cavendish westmacott giant bread to her mother who by that time had died
it went on to describe the basic set up of the plot and concluded it is said to be the author first book and the result of bet about the possibility of writing detective story in which the reader would not be able to spot the criminal
and you may safely make wager with yourself that until you have heard hercule_poirot final word on the mysterious affair at styles you will be kept guessing at its solution and will most certainly never lay down this most entertaining book
the novel review in the sunday time of february quoted the publisher promotional blurb concerning christie writing the book as the result of bet that she would not be able to do so without the reader being able to guess the murderer then said personally we did not find the spotting so very difficult but we are free to admit that the story is especially for first adventure in fiction very well contrived and that the solution of the mystery is the result of logical deduction
every reader must admit that the bet was won the new york time book review december was also impressed the story moreover has no lack of movement and the several characters are well drawn
the contributor who wrote his column under the pseudonym of a man of kent in the february issue of the christian newspaper
the british weekly praised the novel but was overly generous in giving away the identity of the murderers it will rejoice the heart of all who truly relish detective stories from mr mckenna downwards
if so the feat was amazing for the book is put together so deftly that can remember no recent book of the kind which approaches it in merit
i have heard that this is miss christie first book and that she wrote it in response to challenge it is well written well proportioned and full of surprises
for my part made up my mind from the beginning that the middle aged husband of the old lady was in every way qualified to murder her and refused to surrender this conviction when suspicion of him is scattered for moment
but was not in the least degree prepared to find that his accomplice was the woman who pretended to be friend
i ought to say however that an expert in detective stories with whom discussed it said he was convinced from the beginning that the true culprit was the woman whom the victim in her lifetime believed to be her staunchest friend
when does the reader first suspect the murderer i hope have not revealed too much of the plot lovers of good detective stories will without exception rejoice in this book
the bodley head quoted excerpts from this review in future books by christie but understandably did not use those passages which gave away the identity of the culprits
introducing hercule_poirot the brilliant and eccentric detective who at friend request steps out of retirement and into the shadows of classic mystery on the outskirts of essex
the victim is the wealthy mistress of styles court found in her locked bedroom with the name of her late husband on her dying lips
hercule_poirot has few question for her fortune hunting new spouse her aimless stepsons her private doctor and her hired companion who responsible and why can only be revealed by the master detective himself
in his book talent to deceive an appreciation of agatha christie robert barnard wrote christie debut novel from which she made and mr_john_cavendish lane made goodness knows how much
book jacket berkley book edition april the big house in wartime with privations war work and rumours of spies
her hand was over liberal with clues and red herrings but it was highly cunning hand even at this stage in general the mysterious affair at styles is considerable achievement for first off author
the country house party murder is stereotype in the detective story genre which christie makes no great use of not her sort of occasion at least later in life and perhaps not really her class
this is one of the few christies anchored in time and space we are in essex during the first world war
the family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical not one of her later splendid monsters but sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation
if the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish even wasteful nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the edwardian summer that the era of country house living has entered its final phase
christie takes advantage of this end of an era feeling in several way while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony sense of decline of break up is evident feudal attitudes exist but they crack easily
the marriage of the matriarch with mysterious nobody is the central out of joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes
the family is lightly but effectively characterised and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers the small businessmen and the surrounding farmers the nucleus of mayhem parva
the family party is much more in her line and this is what we have here it is too very clever story with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast
we are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories and when cleverness was more important than suspense
but here we come to problem that agatha christie has not yet solved for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting and too many clues tend to cancel each other out as far as reader interest is concerned
december january the writers picked the mysterious affair at styles as an ew favorite on the list of the nine great christie novels
