'' ","i":64220},{"w":"`` Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne 's . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation . Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility , and , at the request of the gentlemen , remained at the instrument till her ladyship 's carriage was ready to take them all home . Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and , to her very great surprise , Mr. Darcy , and Mr. Darcy only , entered the room . He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within .

Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . It will not do . My feelings will not be repressed . You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . This he considered sufficient encouragement ; and the avowal of all that he felt , and had long felt for her , immediately followed . He spoke well ; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed ; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . His sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man 's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .

He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . They talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit -- of everything but himself ; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece 's beginning the subject . Chapter 46 Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third her repining was over , and her sister justified , by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .

I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . '' ","i":24623},{"w":"`` Probably not ; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses . He does not want abilities . He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal-minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable -- allowing something for fortune and figure . The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips . It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged that she would not make herself uneasy . I know very well , madam , '' ","i":29846},{"w":"`` that when persons sit down to a card-table , they must take their chances of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . Mr. Wickham 's attention was caught ; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . '' ","i":30038},{"w":"`` by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . '' ","i":35314},{"w":"`` to be dissatisfied with my reception . Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . It was really a very handsome thought . Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . She saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like Bingley 's two sisters . Her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . When they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person -LRB- Lady Lucas -RRB- freely , openly , and of nothing else '' ","i":35995},{"w":"`` were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . And with a bow to Mr. Darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . Many stared -- many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . To Elizabeth it appeared that , had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations , was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . She was teased by Mr. Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . He assured her , that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . '' ","i":37127},{"w":"`` My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances -LRB- like myself -RRB- to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh 's footstool , that she said , ` Mr. Collins , you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . '' ","i":38832},{"w":"`` I am not now to learn , '' ","i":39465},{"w":"`` that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second , or even a third time . I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long .

'' ","i":39723},{"w":"`` When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . '' ","i":39906},{"w":"`` and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable .

Far be it from me , '' ","i":42167},{"w":"`` to resent the behaviour of your daughter . Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own . But we are all liable to error . My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . The discussion of Mr. Collins 's offer was now nearly at an end , and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother . As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . He scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . '' ","i":42197},{"w":"`` I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence . Risk anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . '' ","i":45869},{"w":"`` Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us . I should say , one of her ladyship 's carriages , for she has several . '' ","i":57672},{"w":"`` that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship 's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings .

We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and , from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome .

She liked him too little to care for his approbation . '' ","i":18047},{"w":"`` I heard you before , but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . You wanted me , I know , to say ` Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare . Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her .

How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? Since her father 's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . '' ","i":29740},{"w":"`` it is enough -- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . Elizabeth 's spirits were so high on this occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley 's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance . I am by no means of the opinion , I assure you , '' ","i":31532},{"w":"`` Both , '' ","i":33216},{"w":"`` for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb .

At that moment , Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy , he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . '' ","i":33506},{"w":"`` His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , '' ","i":34592},{"w":"`` for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy 's steward , and of that , I can assure you , he informed me himself .

Mr. Bingley 's defense of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before . She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it . On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . I have found out , '' ","i":35124},{"w":"`` Dear madam , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr. Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear . I am going away myself . '' ","i":38450},{"w":"`` Upon my word , sir , '' ","i":39580},{"w":"`` your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration . I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies -LRB- if such young ladies there are -RRB- who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . You could not make me happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so . I am perfectly serious in my refusal . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . '' ","i":39591},{"w":"`` Really , Mr. Collins , '' ","i":40254},{"w":"`` you puzzle me exceedingly . I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . Do not consider me now as an elegant female , intending to plague you , but as a rational creature , speaking the truth from her heart . '' ","i":40267},{"w":"`` You must decide for yourself , '' ","i":44343},{"w":"`` and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . '' ","i":44354},{"w":"`` and I am more obliged to you than I can express . '' ","i":44797},{"w":"`` Undoubtedly ; '' ","i":46528},{"w":"`` you are too good . Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you .

You wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody . I only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it . Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will . You need not . There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately , one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte 's marriage . It is unaccountable ! In every view it is unaccountable ! '' ","i":49312},{"w":"`` I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley 's conduct to design , '' ","i":49898},{"w":"`` but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . And men take care that they should . '' ","i":49918},{"w":"`` An excellent consolation in its way , '' ","i":51510},{"w":"`` but it will not do for us . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . '' ","i":51522},{"w":"`` So much the better . I hope they will not meet at all . But does not Jane correspond with his sister ? She will not be able to help calling . '' ","i":52015},{"w":"`` You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . I have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . But as it is , you must not let your fancy run away with you . You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , I am sure . You must not disappoint your father . '' ","i":52627},{"w":"`` Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often . As I did the other day , '' ","i":53114},{"w":"`` very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . At least , you should not remind your mother of inviting him . '' ","i":53146},{"w":"`` I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . '' ","i":53481},{"w":"`` what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . '' ","i":56119},{"w":"`` have it as you choose . He shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish .

How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . '' ","i":60321},{"w":"`` With three younger sisters grown up , '' ","i":60823},{"w":"`` your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence .

'' ","i":64131},{"w":"`` I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? '' ","i":64757},{"w":"`` I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , '' ","i":65232},{"w":"`` Is this , '' ","i":66991},{"w":"`` And pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ? '' ","i":67022},{"w":"`` I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal . But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . '' ","i":67093},{"w":"`` I know them a little . Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man -- he is a great friend of Darcy 's . '' ","i":67364},{"w":"`` Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . '' ","i":67396},{"w":"`` I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgement alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy . But , '' ","i":67791},{"w":"`` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . '' ","i":67846},{"w":"`` In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could feel gratitude , I would now thank you . But I can not -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . Mr. Darcy , who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . '' ","i":69236},{"w":"`` I might as well inquire , '' ","i":69505},{"w":"`` why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? But it is of small importance . '' ","i":69516},{"w":"`` on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . On this subject , what can you have to say ? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ? '' ","i":69897},{"w":"`` You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . '' ","i":70403},{"w":"`` From the very beginning -- from the first moment , I may almost say -- of my acquaintance with you , your manners , impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . '' ","i":70470},{"w":"`` I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? '' ","i":71217},{"w":"`` FITZWILLIAM DARCY '' ","i":74372},{"w":"`` This must be false ! when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again . In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words . This can not be ! This must be the grossest falsehood ! '' ","i":74647},{"w":"`` But if that is the case , you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer . But so they always are . His attachment to Rosings certainly increases . '' ","i":76949},{"w":"`` I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , '' ","i":77001},{"w":"`` but it is not in my power to accept it . '' ","i":77018},{"w":"`` And how much I shall have to conceal ! '' ","i":79230},{"w":"`` Are they indeed ! '' ","i":79715},{"w":"`` safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . '' ","i":80059},{"w":"`` I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . Their party in the dining-room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects that occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and , on the other , retailing them all to the younger Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person 's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . As we went along , Kitty and I drew up the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . '' ","i":80738},{"w":"`` and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment ! '' ","i":81453},{"w":"`` Indeed , '' ","i":81473},{"w":"`` I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings , which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . The comfort to her of the regiment 's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression . '' ","i":81480},{"w":"`` you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Darcy 's ; but you shall do as you choose . '' ","i":81707},{"w":"`` Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham 's character . '' ","i":82230},{"w":"`` Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your opinion ? '' ","i":82299},{"w":"`` You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re-establish a character . She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . We must not make him desperate . '' ","i":82475},{"w":"`` if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . '' ","i":82657},{"w":"`` If you were aware , '' ","i":84051},{"w":"`` of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner -- nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . '' ","i":84061},{"w":"`` that I have something to wish for . Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister 's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised . A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs. Forster called her , and they were going off to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt -- for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . '' ","i":86647},{"w":"`` I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner . '' ","i":87314},{"w":"`` I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity . '' ","i":87826},{"w":"`` I might have been mistress ! Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no , '' ","i":88637},{"w":"`` But we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends . '' ","i":88786},{"w":"`` A little .

It can not be for me -- it can not be for my sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . It originated in Mrs. Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's . It is impossible that he should still love me . '' ","i":92337},{"w":"`` for your housekeeper , '' ","i":92525},{"w":"`` I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' She a beauty ! -- I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' Her nose wants character -- there is nothing marked in its lines . But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . '' ","i":98134},{"w":"`` Do you really think so ? '' ","i":102081},{"w":"`` It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , '' ","i":102594},{"w":"`` that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . He can not afford it . But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . '' ","i":102616},{"w":"`` Not the slightest . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . '' ","i":103384},{"w":"`` Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ; that one false step involves her in endless ruin ; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ; and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . '' ","i":105095},{"w":"`` Oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! '' ","i":106128},{"w":"`` I never saw anyone so shocked . He could not speak a word for full ten minutes .

If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps , Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living , better than any other person . '' ","i":107406},{"w":"`` You must not be too severe upon yourself , '' ","i":108939},{"w":"`` I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . Dear madam , '' ","i":109466},{"w":"`` Is it possible ? '' ","i":110323},{"w":"`` come back and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is in such a case .

His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh ! it must be my uncle 's doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this .

He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday . '' ","i":121374},{"w":"`` I saw you look at me to-day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . But do n't imagine it was from any silly cause .

Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . But Mr. Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fear ; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table , they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters . Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before . The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business , had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty .

The venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch . And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . And what do you think she said besides ? ' I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . Mrs. Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of Bingley 's behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals .

Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . They were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it , but proud and conceited . They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank , and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others . They were of a respectable family in the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother 's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . Mr. Bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but , though he was now only established as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table -- nor was Mrs. Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House . He did look at it , and into it for half-an-hour -- was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness , openness , and ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied .

I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon .

Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at Longbourn . There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark ; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace -- when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage -- the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . Never , even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings . Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour ; and when they arose to depart , Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner at Pemberley , before they left the country . Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . Presuming however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends . Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased , and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little . Eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner 's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication . It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .
