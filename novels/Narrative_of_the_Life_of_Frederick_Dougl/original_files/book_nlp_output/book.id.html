<p/>FREDERICK DOUGLASS. CHAPTER I CHAPTER II CHAPTER III CHAPTER IV CHAPTER V CHAPTER VI CHAPTER VII CHAPTER VIII CHAPTER IX CHAPTER X CHAPTER XI
<p/>In the month of August, 1841, I attended an anti-slavery convention in Nantucket, at which it was my happiness to become acquainted with Frederick Douglass , the writer of the following Narrative.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) was a stranger to nearly every member of that body; but, having recently made his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) escape from the southern prison-house of bondage, and feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) curiosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of the abolitionists,--of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) had heard a somewhat vague description while he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) was a slave,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) was induced to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) attendance, on the occasion alluded to, though at that time a resident in New Bedford.
<p/>Fortunate, most fortunate occurrence!--fortunate for the millions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) manacled brethren, yet panting for deliverance from their awful thraldom!--fortunate for the cause of negro emancipation, and of universal liberty!--fortunate for the land of his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) birth, which he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) has already done so much to save and bless!--fortunate for a large circle of friends and acquaintances, whose sympathy and affection he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) has strongly secured by the many sufferings he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) has endured, by his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) virtuous traits of character, by his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) ever-abiding remembrance of those who are in bonds, as being bound with them!--fortunate for the multitudes, in various parts of our republic, whose minds he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) has enlightened on the subject of slavery, and who have been melted to tears by his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) pathos, or roused to virtuous indignation by his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) stirring eloquence against the enslavers of men!--fortunate for himself, as it at once brought him (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) into the field of public usefulness, <div class="bookquote">``gave the world assurance of a MAN,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>quickened the slumbering energies of his (<font color='blue'><b>MAN</b></font>) soul, and consecrated him (<font color='blue'><b>MAN</b></font>) to the great work of breaking the rod of the oppressor, and letting the oppressed go free!
<p/>I shall never forget his (<font color='blue'><b>MAN</b></font>) first speech at the convention--the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind--the powerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory, completely taken by surprise--the applause which followed from the beginning to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>MAN</b></font>) felicitous remarks.
<p/>I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment; certainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by it, on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered far more clear than ever.
<p/>There stood one, in physical proportion and stature commanding and exact--in intellect richly endowed--in natural eloquence a prodigy--in soul manifestly <div class="bookquote">``created but a little lower than the angels'' (<font color='red'><b>a prodigy</b></font>)</div>--yet a slave, ay, a fugitive slave,--trembling for his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) safety, hardly daring to believe that on the American soil, a single white person could be found who would befriend him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) at all hazards, for the love of God and humanity!
<p/>Capable of high attainments as an intellectual and moral being--needing nothing but a comparatively small amount of cultivation to make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) an ornament to society and a blessing to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) race--by the law of the land, by the voice of the people, by the terms of the slave code, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was only a piece of property, a beast of burden, a chattel personal, nevertheless!
<p/>A beloved friend from New Bedford prevailed on Mr. Douglass to address the convention: He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) came forward to the platform with a hesitancy and embarrassment, necessarily the attendants of a sensitive mind in such a novel position.
<p/>After apologizing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) ignorance, and reminding the audience that slavery was a poor school for the human intellect and heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) proceeded to narrate some of the facts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) own history as a slave, and in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) speech gave utterance to many noble thoughts and thrilling reflections.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) seat, filled with hope and admiration, I rose, and declared that Patrick Henry , of revolutionary fame, never made a speech more eloquent in the cause of liberty, than the one we had just listened to from the lips of that hunted fugitive.
<p/>I reminded the audience of the peril which surrounded this self-emancipated young man at the North,--even in Massachusetts, on the soil of the Pilgrim Fathers, among the descendants of revolutionary sires; and I appealed to them, whether they would ever allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Pilgrim</b></font>) to be carried back into slavery,--law or no law, constitution or no constitution.
<p/>APPENDIX A PARODY PREFACE So I believed at that time--such is my belief now. The response was unanimous and in thunder-tones--<div class="bookquote">``NO!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``YES!''  (<font color='red'><b>the tyrants</b></font>)</div>shouted the whole mass, with an energy so startling, that the ruthless tyrants south of Mason and Dixon's line might almost have heard the mighty burst of feeling, and recognized it as the pledge of an invincible determination, on the part of those who gave it, never to betray him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) that wanders, but to hide the outcast, and firmly to abide the consequences.
<p/>It was at once deeply impressed upon my mind, that, if Mr. Douglass could be persuaded to consecrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) time and talents to the promotion of the anti-slavery enterprise, a powerful impetus would be given to it, and a stunning blow at the same time inflicted on northern prejudice against a colored complexion.
<p/>I therefore endeavored to instil hope and courage into his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) mind, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) might dare to engage in a vocation so anomalous and responsible for a person in his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) situation; and I was seconded in this effort by warm-hearted friends, especially by the late General Agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, Mr. John A. Collins , whose judgment in this instance entirely coincided with my own.
<p/>At first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could give no encouragement; with unfeigned diffidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was not adequate to the performance of so great a task; the path marked out was wholly an untrodden one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was sincerely apprehensive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) should do more harm than good.
<p/>After much deliberation, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) consented to make a trial; and ever since that period, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) has acted as a lecturing agent, under the auspices either of the American or the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society.
<p/>In labors he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) has been most abundant; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) success in combating prejudice, in gaining proselytes, in agitating the public mind, has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations that were raised at the commencement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) brilliant career.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you succor and protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) as a brother-man--a resident of the old Bay State?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) has borne himself with gentleness and meekness, yet with true manliness of character.
<p/>There is in him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that union of head and heart, which is indispensable to an enlightenment of the heads and a winning of the hearts of others.
<p/>As a public speaker, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) excels in pathos, wit, comparison, imitation, strength of reasoning, and fluency of language. May his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) strength continue to be equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) day!
<p/>May he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) continue to <div class="bookquote">``grow in grace, and in the knowledge of God,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may be increasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding humanity, whether at home or abroad!
<p/>It is certainly a very remarkable fact, that one of the most efficient advocates of the slave population, now before the public, is a fugitive slave, in the person of Frederick Douglass ; and that the free colored population of the United States are as ably represented by one of their own number, in the person of Charles Lenox Remond , whose eloquent appeals have extorted the highest applause of multitudes on both sides of the Atlantic.
<p/>Let the calumniators of the colored race despise themselves for their baseness and illiberality of spirit, and henceforth cease to talk of the natural inferiority of those who require nothing but time and opportunity to attain to the highest point of human excellence.
<p/>It may, perhaps, be fairly questioned, whether any other portion of the population of the earth could have endured the privations, sufferings and horrors of slavery, without having become more degraded in the scale of humanity than the slaves of African descent.
<p/>Nothing has been left undone to cripple their intellects, darken their minds, debase their moral nature, obliterate all traces of their relationship to mankind; and yet how wonderfully they have sustained the mighty load of a most frightful bondage, under which they have been groaning for centuries!
<p/>To illustrate the effect of slavery on the white man,--to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no powers of endurance, in such a condition, superior to those of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black brother,-- Daniel O'connell , the distinguished advocate of universal emancipation, and the mightiest champion of prostrate but not conquered Ireland, relates the following anecdote in a speech delivered by him (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) in the Conciliation Hall, Dublin, before the Loyal National Repeal Association, March 31, 1845.
<p/>'' No matter,'' said Mr. O'connell , <div class="bookquote">``under what specious term it may disguise itself, slavery is still hideous. It has a natural, an inevitable tendency to brutalize every noble faculty of man.
<p/>An American sailor, who was cast away on the shore of Africa, where he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was kept in slavery for three years, was, at the expiration of that period, found to be imbruted and stultified--he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had lost all reasoning power; and having forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) native language, could only utter some savage gibberish between Arabic and English, which nobody could understand, and which even he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) himself found difficulty in pronouncing.
<p/>Admitting this to have been an extraordinary case of mental deterioration, it proves at least that the white slave can sink as low in the scale of humanity as the black one.
<p/>Mr. Douglass has very properly chosen to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) own Narrative, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) own style, and according to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) ability, rather than to employ some one else.
<p/>It is, therefore, entirely his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) own production; and, considering how long and dark was the career he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) had to run as a slave,--how few have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) opportunities to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) mind since he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) iron fetters,--it
<p/>So much for the humanizing influence of The Domestic Institution !''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>is, in my judgment, highly creditable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) head and heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) who can peruse it without a tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit,--without being filled with an unutterable abhorrence of slavery and all its abettors, and animated with a determination to seek the immediate overthrow of that execrable system,--without trembling for the fate of this country in the hands of a righteous God, who is ever on the side of the oppressed, and whose arm is not shortened that it cannot save,--must have a flinty heart, and be qualified to act the part of a trafficker <div class="bookquote">``in slaves and the souls of men.
<p/>I am confident that it is essentially true in all its statements; that nothing has been set down in malice, nothing exaggerated, nothing drawn from the imagination; that it comes short of the reality, rather than overstates a single fact in regard to slavery as it is .
<p/>The experience of Frederick Douglass , as a slave, was not a peculiar one; his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) lot was not especially a hard one; his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) case may be regarded as a very fair specimen of the treatment of slaves in Maryland, in which State it is conceded that they are better fed and less cruelly treated than in Georgia, Alabama, or Louisiana.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a trafficker souls</b></font>)</div>Many have suffered incomparably more, while very few on the plantations have suffered less, than himself. Yet how deplorable was his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) situation!
<p/>with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) noble powers and sublime aspirations, how like a brute was he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) treated, even by those professing to have the same mind in them that was in Christ Jesus!
<p/>what terrible chastisements were inflicted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) person! what still more shocking outrages were perpetrated upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) mind! to what dreadful liabilities was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) continually subjected!
<p/>how heavy was the midnight of woe which shrouded in blackness the last ray of hope, and filled the future with terror and gloom!
<p/>what longings after freedom took possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) breast, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) misery augmented, in proportion as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) grew reflective and intelligent,--thus demonstrating that a happy slave is an extinct man!
<p/>how destitute of friendly counsel and aid, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) greatest extremities! how he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) thought, reasoned, felt, under the lash of the driver, with the chains upon his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) limbs!
<p/>what perils he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) encountered in his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) endeavors to escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) horrible doom! and how signal have been his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) deliverance and preservation in the midst of a nation of pitiless enemies!
<p/>This Narrative contains many affecting incidents, many passages of great eloquence and power; but I think the most thrilling one of them all is the description Douglass gives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) feelings, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) stood soliloquizing respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) fate, and the chances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) one day being a freeman, on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay--viewing the receding vessels as they flew with their white wings before the breeze, and apostrophizing them as animated by the living spirit of freedom.
<p/>Compressed into it is a whole Alexandrian library of thought, feeling, and sentiment--all that can, all that need be urged, in the form of expostulation, entreaty, rebuke, against that crime of crimes,--making man the property of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow-man!
<p/>O, how accursed is that system, which entombs the godlike mind of man, defaces the divine image, reduces those who by creation were crowned with glory and honor to a level with four-footed beasts, and exalts the dealer in human flesh above all that is called God!
<p/>Who can read that passage, and be insensible to its pathos and sublimity? Why should its existence be prolonged one hour?
<p/>What does its presence imply but the absence of all fear of God, all regard for man, on the part of the people of the United States?
<p/>So profoundly ignorant of the nature of slavery are many persons, that they are stubbornly incredulous whenever they read or listen to any recital of the cruelties which are daily inflicted on its victims.
<p/>They do not deny that the slaves are held as property; but that terrible fact seems to convey to their minds no idea of injustice, exposure to outrage, or savage barbarity.
<p/>Tell them of cruel scourgings, of mutilations and brandings, of scenes of pollution and blood, of the banishment of all light and knowledge, and they affect to be greatly indignant at such enormous exaggerations, such wholesale misstatements, such abominable libels on the character of the southern planters!
<p/>Is it not evil, only evil, and that continually? Heaven speed its eternal overthrow! As if all these direful outrages were not the natural results of slavery!
<p/>As if it were less cruel to reduce a human being to the condition of a thing, than to give him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) a severe flagellation, or to deprive him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) of necessary food and clothing!
<p/>As if whips, chains, thumb-screws, paddles, blood-hounds, overseers, drivers, patrols, were not all indispensable to keep the slaves down, and to give protection to their ruthless oppressors!
<p/>As if, when the marriage institution is abolished, concubinage, adultery, and incest, must not necessarily abound; when all the rights of humanity are annihilated, any barrier remains to protect the victim from the fury of the spoiler; when absolute power is assumed over life and liberty, it will not be wielded with destructive sway!
<p/>In some few instances, their incredulity arises from a want of reflection; but, generally, it indicates a hatred of the light, a desire to shield slavery from the assaults of its foes, a contempt of the colored race, whether bond or free.
<p/>Such will try to discredit the shocking tales of slaveholding cruelty which are recorded in this truthful Narrative; but they will labor in vain.
<p/>Mr. Douglass has frankly disclosed the place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) birth, the names of those who claimed ownership in his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) body and soul, and the names also of those who committed the crimes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) has alleged against them.
<p/>In the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) Narrative, he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) relates two instances of murderous cruelty,--in one of which a planter deliberately shot a slave belonging to a neighboring plantation, who had unintentionally gotten within his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) lordly domain in quest of fish; and in the other, an overseer blew out the brains of a slave who had fled to a stream of water to escape a bloody scourging.
<p/>Mr. Douglass states that in neither of these instances was any thing done by way of legal arrest or judicial investigation.
<p/>The Baltimore American, of March 17, 1845, relates a similar case of atrocity, perpetrated with similar impunity--as follows:--'' Shooting a slave.
<p/>--We learn, upon the authority of a letter from Charles county, Maryland, received by a gentleman of this city, that a young man, named Matthews, a nephew of General Matthews, and whose father, it is believed, holds an office at Washington, killed one of the slaves upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's farm by shooting him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>The letter states that young Matthews had been left in charge of the farm; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthews</b></font>) gave an order to the servant, which was disobeyed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthews</b></font>) proceeded to the house, obtained a gun, and, returning, shot the servant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) immediately, the letter continues, fled to his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) father's residence, where he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) still remains unmolested.''--Let it never be forgotten, that no slaveholder or overseer can be convicted of any outrage perpetrated on the person of a slave, however diabolical it may be, on the testimony of colored witnesses, whether bond or free.
<p/>By the slave code, they are adjudged to be as incompetent to testify against a white man, as though they were indeed a part of the brute creation.
<p/>Hence, there is no legal protection in fact, whatever there may be in form, for the slave population; and any amount of cruelty may be inflicted on them with impunity.
<p/>Skeptics of this character abound in society. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) statements, therefore, may easily be disproved, if they are untrue. Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society?
<p/>The effect of a religious profession on the conduct of southern masters is vividly described in the following Narrative, and shown to be any thing but salutary.
<p/>In the nature of the case, it must be in the highest degree pernicious. The testimony of Mr. Douglass , on this point, is sustained by a cloud of witnesses, whose veracity is unimpeachable.
<p/>'' A slaveholder's profession of Christianity is a palpable imposture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) is a felon of the highest grade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) is a man-stealer.
<p/>It is of no importance what you put in the other scale. '' Reader! are you with the man-stealers in sympathy and purpose, or on the side of their down-trodden victims?
<p/>If with the former, then are you the foe of God and man. If with the latter, what are you prepared to do and dare in their behalf?
<p/>Come what may--cost what it may--inscribe on the banner which you unfurl to the breeze, as your religious and political motto--``NO COMPROMISE WITH SLAVERY!
<p/>Be faithful, be vigilant, be untiring in your efforts to break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free. NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!
<p/>My Dear Friend: You remember the old fable of <div class="bookquote">``The Man and the Lion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dear Friend</b></font>)</div>where the lion complained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) should not be so misrepresented <div class="bookquote">``when the lions wrote history.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>WM. LLOYD GARRISON BOSTON, May 1, 1845. LETTER FROM WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.. BOSTON, APRIL 22, 1845. '' I am glad the time has come when the ``lions write history.
<p/>One might, indeed, rest sufficiently satisfied with what, it is evident, must be, in general, the results of such a relation, without seeking farther to find whether they have followed in every instance.
<p/>Indeed, those who stare at the half-peck of corn a week, and love to count the lashes on the slave's back, are seldom the <div class="bookquote">``stuff''  (<font color='red'><b>the slave</b></font>)</div>out of which reformers and abolitionists are to be made.
<p/>I remember that, in 1838, many were waiting for the results of the West India experiment, before they could come into our ranks.
<p/>'' We have been left long enough to gather the character of slavery from the involuntary evidence of the masters. Those <div class="bookquote">``results''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>have come long ago; but, alas!
<p/>A man must be disposed to judge of emancipation by other tests than whether it has increased the produce of sugar,--and to hate slavery for other reasons than because it starves men and whips
<p/>few of that number have come with them, as converts. women,--before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is ready to lay the first stone of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anti-slavery life.
<p/>I was glad to learn, in your story, how early the most neglected of God's children waken to a sense of their rights, and of the injustice done them.
<p/>Experience is a keen teacher; and long before you had mastered your A B C, or knew where the <div class="bookquote">``white sails''  (<font color='red'><b>Experience a teacher</b></font>)</div>of the Chesapeake were bound, you began, I see, to gauge the wretchedness of the slave, not by his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) hunger and want, not by his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) lashes and toil, but by the cruel and blighting death which gathers over his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) soul.
<p/>In connection with this, there is one circumstance which makes your recollections peculiarly valuable, and renders your early insight the more remarkable.
<p/>Let us hear, then, what it is at its best estate--gaze on its bright side, if it has one; and then imagination may task her (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) powers to add dark lines to the picture, as she (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) travels southward to that -LRB-for the colored man-RRB-
<p/>You come from that part of the country where we are told slavery appears with its fairest features. Valley of the Shadow of Death, where the Mississippi sweeps along.
<p/>Every one who has heard you speak has felt, and, I am confident, every one who reads your book will feel, persuaded that you give them a fair specimen of the whole truth.
<p/>No one-sided portrait,--no wholesale complaints,--but strict justice done, whenever individual kindliness has neutralized, for a moment, the deadly system with which it was strangely allied.
<p/>You have been with us, too, some years, and can fairly compare the twilight of rights, which your race enjoy at the North, with that <div class="bookquote">``noon of night''  (<font color='red'><b>Mason</b></font>)</div>under which they labor south of Mason and Dixon's line.
<p/>Tell us whether, after all, the half-free colored man of Massachusetts is worse off than the pampered slave of the rice swamps!
<p/>Again, we have known you long, and can put the most entire confidence in your truth, candor, and sincerity. In reading your life, no one can say that we have unfairly picked out some rare specimens of cruelty.
<p/>We know that the bitter drops, which even you have drained from the cup, are no incidental aggravations, no individual ills, but such as must mingle always and necessarily in the lot of every slave.
<p/>They are the essential ingredients, not the occasional results, of the system. After all, I shall read your book with trembling for you.
<p/>Some years ago, when you were beginning to tell me your real name and birthplace, you may remember I stopped you, and preferred to remain ignorant of all.
<p/>I hardly knew, at the time, whether to thank you or not for the sight of them, when I reflected that it was still dangerous, in Massachusetts, for honest men to tell their names!
<p/>With the exception of a vague description, so I continued, till the other day, when you read me your memoirs. They say the fathers, in 1776, signed the Declaration of Independence with the halter about their necks.
<p/>In all the broad lands which the Constitution of the United States overshadows, there is no single spot,--however narrow or desolate,--where a fugitive slave can plant himself and say, <div class="bookquote">``I am safe.
<p/>You, too, publish your declaration of freedom with danger compassing you around. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a slave</b></font>)</div>The whole armory of Northern Law has no shield for you.
<p/>You, perhaps, may tell your story in safety, endeared as you are to so many warm hearts by rare gifts, and a still rarer devotion of them to the service of others.
<p/>But it will be owing only to your labors, and the fearless efforts of those who, trampling the laws and Constitution of the country under their feet, are determined that they will <div class="bookquote">``hide the outcast,''  (<font color='red'><b>bear witness</b></font>)</div>and that their hearths shall be, spite of the law, an asylum for the oppressed, if, some time or other, the humblest may stand in our streets, and bear witness in safety against the cruelties of which he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) has been the victim.
<p/>Yet it is sad to think, that these very throbbing hearts which welcome your story, and form your best safeguard in telling it, are all beating contrary to the <div class="bookquote">``statute in such case made and provided.
<p/>Go on, my dear friend, till you, and those who, like you, have been saved, so as by fire, from the dark prison-house, shall stereotype these free, illegal pulses into statutes; and New England, cutting loose from a blood-stained Union, shall glory in being the house of refuge for the oppressed,--till
<p/>we no longer merely ''  (<font color='red'><b>the outcast</b></font>)</div>hide the outcast,'' or make a merit of standing idly by while he (<font color='blue'><b>outcast</b></font>) is hunted in our midst; but, consecrating anew the soil of the Pilgrims as an asylum for the oppressed, proclaim our welcome to the slave so loudly, that the tones shall reach every hut in the Carolinas, and make the broken-hearted bondman leap up at the thought of old Massachusetts.
<p/>I am free to say that, in your place, I should throw the MS. into the fire. '' God speed the day!
<p/>Till then, and ever, Yours truly, WENDELL PHILLIPS FREDERICK DOUGLASS. Frederick Douglass was born in slavery as Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey near Easton in Talbot County, Maryland.
<p/>As a young boy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sent to Baltimore, to be a house servant, where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) learned to read and write, with the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) master's wife.
<p/>In 1838 he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) escaped from slavery and went to New York City, where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) married Anna Murray, a free colored woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had met in Baltimore.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was not sure of the exact year of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) birth, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew that it was 1817 or 1818. Soon thereafter he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name to Frederick Douglass.
<p/>In 1841 he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) addressed a convention of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in Nantucket and so greatly impressed the group that they immediately employed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as an agent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was such an impressive orator that numerous persons doubted if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had ever been a slave, so he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wrote Narrative Of The Life Of Frederick Douglass .
<p/>During the Civil War he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) assisted in the recruiting of colored men for the 54th and 55th Massachusetts Regiments and consistently argued for the emancipation of slaves.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) later years, at different times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) was secretary of the Santo Domingo Commission, marshall and recorder of deeds of the District of Columbia, and United States Minister to Haiti.
<p/>After the war he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) was active in securing and protecting the rights of the freemen. His (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) other autobiographical works are My Bondage And My Freedom and Life
<p/>And Times Of Frederick Douglass , published in 1855 and 1881 respectively. He (<font color='blue'><b>Douglass</b></font>) died in 1895. CHAPTER I I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland.
<p/>By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant.
<p/>I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) birthday.
<p/>They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvest-time, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood.
<p/>The white children could tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege.
<p/>I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit.
<p/>The nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age. I come to this, from hearing my master say, some time during 1835
<p/>, I was about seventeen years old. My mother was named Harriet Bailey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was the daughter of Isaac and Betsey Bailey, both colored, and quite dark.
<p/>My mother was of a darker complexion than either my grandmother or grandfather. My father was a white man. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was admitted to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage.
<p/>The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion, I know nothing; the means of knowing was withheld from me.
<p/>It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age.
<p/>Frequently, before the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and the child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field labor.
<p/>For what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it be to hinder the development of the child's affection toward its mother, and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child.
<p/>My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant--before I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as my mother. This is the inevitable result.
<p/>I never saw my mother, to know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as such, more than four or five times in my life; and each of these times was very short in duration, and at night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) journeys to see me in the night, travelling the whole distance on foot, after the performance of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) day's work.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a field hand, and a whipping is the penalty of not being in the field at sunrise, unless a slave has special permission from his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) master to the contrary--a permission which they seldom get, and one that gives to him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) that gives it the proud name of being a kind master.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was hired by a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles from my home. I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was with me in the night. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gone.
<p/>Very little communication ever took place between us. Death soon ended what little we could have while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lived, and with it her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hardships and suffering.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died when I was about seven years old, on one of my master's farms, near Lee's Mill. I was not allowed to be present during her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) illness, at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death, or burial.
<p/>Never having enjoyed, to any considerable extent, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soothing presence, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tender and watchful care, I received the tidings of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gone long before I knew any thing about it. Called thus suddenly away, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left me without the slightest intimation of who my father was.
<p/>The whisper that my master was my father, may or may not be true; and, true or false, it is of
<p/>but little consequence to my purpose whilst the fact remains, in all its glaring odiousness, that slaveholders have ordained, and by law established, that the children of slave women shall in all cases follow the condition of their mothers; and this is done too obviously to administer to their own lusts, and make a gratification of their wicked desires profitable as well as pleasurable; for by this cunning arrangement, the slaveholder, in cases not a few, sustains to his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) slaves the double relation of master and father.
<p/>I know of such cases; and it is worthy of remark that such slaves invariably suffer greater hardships, and have more to contend with, than others.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) is ever disposed to find fault with them; they can seldom do any thing to please her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) is never better pleased than when she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sees them under the lash, especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) suspects her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) husband of showing to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mulatto children favors which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) withholds from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) black slaves.
<p/>The master is frequently compelled to sell this class of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) white wife; and, cruel as the deed may strike any one to be, for a man to sell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own children to human flesh-mongers, it is often the dictate of humanity for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do so; for, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must not only whip them himself, but must stand by and see one white son tie up his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brother, of but few shades darker complexion than himself, and ply the gory lash to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) naked back; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lisp one word of disapproval, it is set down to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) parental partiality, and only makes a bad matter worse, both for himself and the slave whom he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) would protect and defend.
<p/>They are, in the first place, a constant offence to their mistress. Every year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves.
<p/>It was doubtless in consequence of a knowledge of this fact, that one great statesman of the south predicted the downfall of slavery by the inevitable laws of population.
<p/>Whether this prophecy is ever fulfilled or not, it is nevertheless plain that a very different-looking class of people are springing up at the south, and are now held in slavery, from those originally brought to this country from Africa; and if their increase do no other good, it will do away the force of the argument, that God cursed Ham, and therefore American slavery is right.
<p/>If the lineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally enslaved, it is certain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural; for thousands are ushered into the world, annually, who, like myself, owe their existence to white fathers, and those fathers most frequently their own masters.
<p/>I have had two masters. My first master's name was Anthony. I do not remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) first name. He (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) was generally called Captain Anthony--a title which, I presume, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) acquired by sailing a craft on the Chesapeake Bay.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) was not considered a rich slaveholder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) owned two or three farms, and about thirty slaves. His (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) farms and slaves were under the care of an overseer.
<p/>The overseer's name was Plummer. Mr. Plummer was a miserable drunkard, a profane swearer, and a savage monster. He (<font color='blue'><b>Plummer</b></font>) always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel.
<p/>I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Plummer</b></font>) to cut and slash the women's heads so horribly, that even master would be enraged at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cruelty, and would threaten to whip him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did not mind himself.
<p/>Master, however, was not a humane slaveholder. It required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an overseer to affect him (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>) was a cruel man, hardened by a long life of slaveholding.
<p/>I have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most heart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>) used to tie up to a joist, and whip upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) naked back till she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was literally covered with blood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>overseer</b></font>) would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping a slave. No words, no tears, no prayers, from his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) gory victim, seemed to move his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) iron heart from its bloody purpose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) would whip her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) scream, and whip her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) hush; and not until overcome by fatigue, would he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) cease to swing the blood-clotted cowskin.
<p/>The louder she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) screamed, the harder he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) whipped; and where the blood ran fastest, there he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) whipped longest. I remember the first time I ever witnessed this horrible exhibition.
<p/>It was the first of a long series of such outrages, of which I was doomed to be a witness and a participant.
<p/>I was quite a child, but I well remember it. I never shall forget it whilst I remember any thing. It struck me with awful force.
<p/>It was the blood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery, through which I was about to pass. It was a most terrible spectacle.
<p/>I wish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it. This occurrence took place very soon after I went to live with my old master, and under the following circumstances.
<p/>Aunt Hester went out one night,--where or for what I do not know,--and happened to be absent when my master desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) presence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) not to go out evenings, and warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) must never let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) in company with a young man, who was paying attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) belonging to Colonel Lloyd.
<p/>The young man's name was Ned Roberts, generally called Lloyd's Ned. Why master was so careful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), may be safely left to conjecture.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was a woman of noble form, and of graceful proportions, having very few equals, and fewer superiors, in personal appearance, among the colored or white women of our neighborhood.
<p/>Aunt Hester had not only disobeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hester</b></font>) orders in going out, but had been found in company with Lloyd's Ned; which circumstance, I found, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) said while whipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), was the chief offence.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) been a man of pure morals himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) might have been thought interested in protecting the innocence of my aunt; but those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) will not suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) of any such virtue.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) commenced whipping Aunt Hester, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) into the kitchen, and stripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) from neck to waist, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) neck, shoulders, and back, entirely naked.
<p/>After crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) tied them with a strong rope, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) to a stool under a large hook in the joist, put in for the purpose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) to cross her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hands, calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) at the same time a d--d b--h. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) get upon the stool, and tied her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hands to the hook.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) now stood fair for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) infernal purpose. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) arms were stretched up at their full length, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) stood upon the ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) toes.
<p/>--h, I'll learn you how to disobey my orders!'' and after rolling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) sleeves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) commenced to lay on the heavy cowskin, and soon the warm, red blood -LRB-amid heart-rending shrieks from her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), and horrid oaths from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)-RRB- came dripping to the floor.
<p/>I was so terrified and horror-stricken at the sight, that I hid myself in a closet, and dared not venture out till long after the bloody transaction was over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) then said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Now, you d--d b I expected it would be my turn next. It was all new to me.
<p/>I had always lived with my grandmother on the outskirts of the plantation, where she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was put to raise the children of the younger women.
<p/>I had never seen any thing like it before. I had therefore been, until now, out of the way of the bloody scenes that often occurred on the plantation.
<p/>CHAPTER II My master's family consisted of two sons, Andrew and Richard; one daughter, Lucretia, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) husband, Captain Thomas Auld.
<p/>They lived in one house, upon the home plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd. My master was Colonel Lloyd's clerk and superintendent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) was what might be called the overseer of the overseers. I spent two years of childhood on this plantation in my old master's family.
<p/>as I received my first impressions of slavery on this plantation, I will give some description of it, and of slavery as it there existed.
<p/>The plantation is about twelve miles north of Easton, in Talbot county, and is situated on the border of Miles River.
<p/>It was here that I witnessed the bloody transaction recorded in the first chapter; and The principal products raised upon it were tobacco, corn, and wheat.
<p/>These were raised in great abundance; so that, with the products of this and the other farms belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) was able to keep in almost constant employment a large sloop, in carrying them to market at Baltimore.
<p/>This sloop was named Sally Lloyd, in honor of one of the colonel's daughters. My master's son-in-law, Captain Auld, was master of the vessel; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) was otherwise manned by the colonel's own slaves.
<p/>These were esteemed very highly by the other slaves, and looked upon as the privileged ones of the plantation; for it was no small affair, in the eyes of the slaves, to be allowed to see Baltimore.
<p/>Colonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) home plantation, and owned a large number more on the neighboring farms belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>).
<p/>Their names were Peter, Isaac, Rich, and Jake. The names of the farms nearest to the home plantation were Wye Town and New Design.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Wye Town'' was under the overseership of a man named Noah Willis. New Design was under the overseership of a Mr. Townsend.
<p/>The overseers of these, and all the rest of the farms, numbering over twenty, received advice and direction from the managers of the home plantation.
<p/>This was the great business place. It was the seat of government for the whole twenty farms. All disputes among the overseers were settled here.
<p/>If a slave was convicted of any high misdemeanor, became unmanageable, or evinced a determination to run away, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was brought immediately here, severely whipped, put on board the sloop, carried to Baltimore, and sold to Austin Woolfolk, or some other slave-trader, as a warning to the slaves remaining.
<p/>The men and women slaves received, as their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pork, or its equivalent in fish, and one bushel of corn meal.
<p/>Their yearly clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts, one pair of linen trousers, like the shirts, one jacket, one pair of trousers for winter, made of coarse negro cloth, one pair of stockings, and one pair of shoes; the whole of which could not have cost more than seven dollars.
<p/>Here, too, the slaves of all the other farms received their monthly allowance of food, and their yearly clothing. The allowance of the slave children was given to their mothers, or the old women having the care of them.
<p/>The children unable to work in the field had neither shoes, stockings, jackets, nor trousers, given to them; their clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year.
<p/>Children from seven to ten years old, of both sexes, almost naked, might be seen at all seasons of the year.
<p/>There were no beds given the slaves, unless one coarse blanket be considered such, and none but the men and women had these.
<p/>They find less difficulty from the want of beds, than from the want of time to sleep; for when their day's work in the field is done, the most of them having their washing, mending, and cooking to do, and having few or none of the ordinary facilities for doing either of these, very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in preparing for the field the coming day; and when this is done, old and young, male and female, married and single, drop down side by side, on one common bed,--the cold, damp floor,--each covering himself or herself with their miserable blankets; and here they sleep till they are summoned to the field by the driver's horn.
<p/>When these failed them, they went naked until the next allowance-day. This, however, is not considered a very great privation. At the sound of this, all must rise, and be off to the field.
<p/>There must be no halting; every one must be at his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) post; and woe betides them who hear not this morning summons to the field; for if they are not awakened by the sense of hearing, they are by the sense of feeling:
<p/>Mr. Severe, the overseer, used to stand by the door of the quarter, armed with a large hickory stick and heavy cowskin, ready to whip any one who was so unfortunate as not to hear, or, from any other cause, was prevented from being ready to start for the field at the sound of the horn.
<p/>I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) whip a woman, causing the blood to run half an hour at the time; and this, too, in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crying children, pleading for their mother's release.
<p/>no age nor sex finds any favor. Mr. Severe was rightly named: he (<font color='blue'><b>Severe</b></font>) was a cruel man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Severe</b></font>) seemed to take pleasure in manifesting his (<font color='blue'><b>Severe</b></font>) fiendish barbarity.
<p/>Added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Severe</b></font>) cruelty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Severe</b></font>) was a profane swearer. It was enough to chill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary man to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talk.
<p/>Scarce a sentence escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but that was commenced or concluded by some horrid oath. The field was the place to witness his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) cruelty and profanity.
<p/>From the rising till the going down of the sun, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was cursing, raving, cutting, and slashing among the slaves of the field, in the most frightful manner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) died very soon after I went to Colonel Lloyd's; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) died as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) lived, uttering, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) dying groans, bitter curses and horrid oaths.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) presence made it both the field of blood and of blasphemy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) career was short. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) death was regarded by the slaves as the result of a merciful providence.
<p/>Mr. Severe's place was filled by a Mr. Hopkins. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>) was a very different man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>) was less cruel, less profane, and made less noise, than Mr. Severe.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) course was characterized by no extraordinary demonstrations of cruelty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) whipped, but seemed to take no pleasure in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was called by the slaves a good overseer.
<p/>The home plantation of Colonel Lloyd wore the appearance of a country village. All the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed here.
<p/>The shoemaking and mending, the blacksmithing, cartwrighting, coopering, weaving, and grain-grinding, were all performed by the slaves on the home plantation.
<p/>The whole place wore a business-like aspect very unlike the neighboring farms. The number of houses, too, conspired to give it advantage over the neighboring farms.
<p/>Few privileges were esteemed higher, by the slaves of the out-farms, than that of being selected to do errands at the Great House Farm.
<p/>A representative could not be prouder of his (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) election to a seat in the American Congress, than a slave on one of the out-farms would be of his (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) election to do errands at the Great House Farm.
<p/>They regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them by their overseers; and it was on this account, as well as a constant desire to be out of the field from under the driver's lash, that they esteemed it a high privilege, one worth careful living for.
<p/>It was called by the slaves the Great House Farm. It was associated in their minds with greatness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was called the smartest and most trusty fellow, who had this honor conferred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) the most frequently.
<p/>The competitors for this office sought as diligently to please their overseers, as the office-seekers in the political parties seek to please and deceive the people.
<p/>The same traits of character might be seen in Colonel Lloyd's slaves, as are seen in the slaves of the political parties.
<p/>The slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm, for the monthly allowance for themselves and their fellow-slaves, were peculiarly enthusiastic.
<p/>While on their way, they would make the dense old woods, for miles around, reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at once the highest joy and the deepest sadness.
<p/>The thought that came up, came out--if not in the word, in the sound;--and as frequently in the one as in the other.
<p/>They would sometimes sing the most pathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone, and the most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone.
<p/>They would compose and sing as they went along, consulting neither time nor tune. Into all of their songs they would manage to weave something of the Great House Farm.
<p/>Especially would they do this, when leaving home. They would then sing most exultingly the following words:-- <div class="bookquote">``I am going away to the Great House Farm!
<p/>This they would sing, as a chorus, to words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to themselves.
<p/>I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do.
<p/>O, yea! O, yea! O!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs.
<p/>They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish.
<p/>I was myself within the circle; so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains.
<p/>The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found myself in tears while hearing them.
<p/>The mere recurrence to those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek.
<p/>To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception.
<p/>If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) go to Colonel Lloyd's plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), in silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) soul,--and if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is not thus impressed, it will only be because <div class="bookquote">``there is no flesh in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) obdurate heart.
<p/>Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I have often been utterly astonished, since I came to the north, to find persons who could speak of the singing, among slaves, as evidence of their contentment and happiness.
<p/>The songs of the slave represent the sorrows of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) heart; and he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is relieved by them, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears.
<p/>It is impossible to conceive of a greater mistake. Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy. At least, such is my experience.
<p/>I have often sung to drown my sorrow, but seldom to express my happiness. Crying for joy, and singing for joy, were alike uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery.
<p/>The singing of a man cast away upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered as evidence of contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave; the songs of the one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion.
<p/>CHAPTER III Colonel Lloyd kept a large and finely cultivated garden, which afforded almost constant employment for four men, besides the chief gardener, -LRB-Mr. M'Durmond.-RRB-
<p/>This garden was probably the greatest attraction of the place. During the summer months, people came from far and near--from Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolis--to see it.
<p/>It abounded in fruits of almost every description, from the hardy apple of the north to the delicate orange of the south.
<p/>Its excellent fruit was quite a temptation to the hungry swarms of boys, as well as the older slaves, belonging to the colonel, few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it.
<p/>This garden was not the least source of trouble on the plantation. Scarcely a day passed, during the summer, but that some slave had to take the lash for stealing fruit.
<p/>The last and most successful one was that of tarring his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) fence all around; after which, if a slave was caught with any tar upon his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) person, it was deemed sufficient proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) had either been into the garden, or had tried to get in.
<p/>The colonel had to resort to all kinds of stratagems to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) slaves out of the garden. In either case, he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) was severely whipped by the chief gardener.
<p/>This plan worked well; the slaves became as fearful of tar as of the lash. They seemed to realize the impossibility of touching tar without being defiled.
<p/>The colonel also kept a splendid riding equipage. His (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) stable and carriage-house presented the appearance of some of our large city livery establishments.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) horses were of the finest form and noblest blood. His (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) carriage-house contained three splendid coaches, three or four gigs, besides dearborns and barouches of the most fashionable style.
<p/>This establishment was under the care of two slaves--old Barney and young Barney--father and son. To attend to this establishment was their sole work.
<p/>But it was by no means an easy employment; for in nothing was Colonel Lloyd more particular than in the management of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) horses.
<p/>The slightest inattention to these was unpardonable, and was visited upon those, under whose care they were placed, with the severest punishment; no excuse could shield them, if the colonel only suspected any want of attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) horses--a supposition which he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) frequently indulged, and one which, of course, made the office of old and young Barney a very trying one.
<p/>They never knew when they were safe from punishment. They were frequently whipped when least deserving, and escaped whipping when most deserving it.
<p/>Every thing depended upon the looks of the horses, and the state of Colonel Lloyd's own mind when his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) horses were brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) for use.
<p/>If a horse did not move fast enough, or hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) head high enough, it was owing to some fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) keepers.
<p/>It was painful to stand near the stable-door, and hear the various complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for use.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has not been sufficiently rubbed and curried, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has not been properly fed; his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) food was too wet or too dry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) got it too soon or too late; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was too hot or too cold; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had too much hay, and not enough of grain; or he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had too much grain, and not enough of hay; instead of old Barney's attending to the horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) had very improperly left it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) son.
<p/>'' This horse has not had proper attention. '' To all these complaints, no matter how unjust, the slave must answer never a word.
<p/>Colonel Lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) spoke, a slave must stand, listen, and tremble; and such was literally the case.
<p/>I have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney, a man between fifty and sixty years of age, uncover his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) bald head, kneel down upon the cold, damp ground, and receive upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) naked and toil-worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time.
<p/>All of these lived at the Great House Farm, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased, from old Barney down to William Wilkes, the coach-driver.
<p/>I have seen Winder make one of the house-servants stand off from him (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) a suitable distance to be touched with the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) whip, and at every stroke raise great ridges upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Barney</b></font>) back.
<p/>Colonel Lloyd had three sons--Edward, Murray, and Daniel,--and three sons-in-law, Mr. Winder, Mr. Nicholson, and Mr. Lowndes. To describe the wealth of Colonel Lloyd would be almost equal to describing the riches of Job.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) kept from ten to fifteen house-servants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) was said to own a thousand slaves, and I think this estimate quite within the truth.
<p/>Colonel Lloyd owned so many that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) did not know them when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) saw them; nor did all the slaves of the out-farms know him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>).
<p/>It is reported of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>), that, while riding along the road one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) met a colored man, and addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) in the usual manner of speaking to colored people on the public highways of the south:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, boy, whom do you belong to?''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>'' To Colonel Lloyd,'' replied the slave. '' Well, does the colonel treat you well?''
<p/>'' No, sir,'' was the ready reply. '' What, does he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) work you too hard?'' '' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, don't he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) give you enough to eat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>The colonel, after ascertaining where the slave belonged, rode on; the man also went on about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business, not dreaming that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been conversing with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master.
<p/>'' Yes, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gives me enough, such as it is. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, said, and heard nothing more of the matter, until two or three weeks afterwards.
<p/>The poor man was then informed by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) overseer that, for having found fault with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now to be sold to a Georgia trader.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was immediately chained and handcuffed; and thus, without a moment's warning, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was snatched away, and forever sundered, from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family and friends, by a hand more unrelenting than death.
<p/>This is the penalty of telling the truth, of telling the simple truth, in answer to a series of plain questions.
<p/>that slaves, when inquired of as to their condition and the character of their masters, almost universally say they are contented, and that their masters are kind.
<p/>The slaveholders have been known to send in spies among their slaves, to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition.
<p/>The frequency of this has had the effect to establish among the slaves the maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head.
<p/>They suppress the truth rather than take the consequences of telling it, and in so doing prove themselves a part of the human family.
<p/>If they have any thing to say of their masters, it is generally in their masters' favor, especially when speaking to an untried man.
<p/>I have been frequently asked, when a slave, if I had a kind master, and do not remember ever to have given a negative answer; nor did I, in pursuing this course, consider myself as uttering what was absolutely false; for I always measured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up among slaveholders around us.
<p/>It is partly in consequence of such facts, Moreover, slaves are like other people, and imbibe prejudices quite common to others.
<p/>Many, under the influence of this prejudice, think their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves; and this, too, in some cases, when the very reverse is true.
<p/>Indeed, it is not uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative goodness of their masters, each contending for the superior goodness of his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) own over that of the others.
<p/>They think their own better than that of others. At the very same time, they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately.
<p/>When Colonel Lloyd's slaves met the slaves of Jacob Jepson, they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters; Colonel Lloyd's slaves contending that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) was the richest, and Mr. Jepson's slaves that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jepson</b></font>) was the smartest, and most of a man.
<p/>It was so on our plantation. Colonel Lloyd's slaves would boast his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson. Mr. Jepson's slaves would boast his (<font color='blue'><b>Jepson</b></font>) ability to whip Colonel Lloyd.
<p/>These quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the parties, and those that whipped were supposed to have gained the point at issue.
<p/>It was considered as being bad enough to be a slave; but to be a poor man's slave was deemed a disgrace indeed!
<p/>They seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was transferable to themselves. CHAPTER IV Mr. Hopkins remained but a short time in the office of overseer.
<p/>Why his (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>) career was so short, I do not know, but suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>) lacked the necessary severity to suit Colonel Lloyd.
<p/>Mr. Hopkins was succeeded by Mr. Austin Gore, a man possessing, in an eminent degree, all those traits of character indispensable to what is called a first-rate overseer.
<p/>Mr. Gore had served Colonel Lloyd, in the capacity of overseer, upon one of the out-farms, and had shown himself worthy of the high station of overseer upon the home or Great House Farm.
<p/>Mr. Gore was proud, ambitious, and persevering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) was artful, cruel, and obdurate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) was just the man for such a place, and it was just the place for such a man.
<p/>It afforded scope for the full exercise of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) powers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be perfectly at home in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was one of those who could torture the slightest look, word, or gesture, on the part of the slave, into impudence, and would treat it accordingly.
<p/>There must be no answering back to him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>); no explanation was allowed a slave, showing himself to have been wrongfully accused.
<p/>Mr. Gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders,--<div class="bookquote">``It is better that a dozen slaves should suffer under the lash, than that the overseer should be convicted, in the presence of the slaves, of having been at fault.
<p/>To be accused was to be convicted, and to be convicted was to be punished; the one always following the other with immutable certainty.
<p/>To escape punishment was to escape accusation; and few slaves had the fortune to do either, under the overseership of Mr. Gore.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) was just proud enough to demand the most debasing homage of the slave, and quite servile enough to crouch, himself, at the feet of the master.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was ambitious enough to be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers, and persevering enough to reach the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ambition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment, artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>slaveholders</b></font>)</div>No matter how innocent a slave might be--it availed him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) nothing, when accused by Mr. Gore of any misdemeanor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) was, of all the overseers, the most dreaded by the slaves.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) presence was painful; his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) eye flashed confusion; and seldom was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) sharp, shrill voice heard, without producing horror and trembling in their ranks.
<p/>Mr. Gore was a grave man, and, though a young man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indulged in no jokes, said no funny words, seldom smiled.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words were in perfect keeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks were in perfect keeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words. Overseers will sometimes indulge in a witty word, even with the slaves; not so with Mr. Gore.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) spoke but to command, and commanded but to be obeyed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) dealt sparingly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) words, and bountifully with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) whip, never using the former where the latter would answer as well.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) whipped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) seemed to do so from a sense of duty, and feared no consequences. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) did nothing reluctantly, no matter how disagreeable; always at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) post, never inconsistent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) never promised but to fulfil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) was, in a word, a man of the most inflexible firmness and stone-like coolness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) savage barbarity was equalled only by the consummate coolness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) committed the grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves under his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) charge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) had given Demby but few stripes, when, to get rid of the scourging, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) ran and plunged himself into a creek, and stood there at the depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) shoulders, refusing to come out.
<p/>Mr. Gore told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) three calls, and that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) did not come out at the third call, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) would shoot him (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Gore once undertook to whip one of Colonel Lloyd's slaves, by the name of Demby. The first call was given.
<p/>Mr. Gore then, without consultation or deliberation with any one, not even giving Demby an additional call, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Demby</b></font>) musket to his (<font color='blue'><b>Demby</b></font>) face, taking deadly aim at his (<font color='blue'><b>Demby</b></font>) standing victim, and in an instant poor Demby was no more.
<p/>Demby made no response, but stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Demby</b></font>) ground. The second and third calls were given with the same result. His (<font color='blue'><b>Demby</b></font>) mangled body sank out of sight, and blood and brains marked the water where he (<font color='blue'><b>Demby</b></font>) had stood.
<p/>A thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation, excepting Mr. Gore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) alone seemed cool and collected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) was asked by Colonel Lloyd and my old master, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) resorted to this extraordinary expedient.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) was setting a dangerous example to the other slaves,--one which, if suffered to pass without some such demonstration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) part, would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and order upon the plantation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) argued that if one slave refused to be corrected, and escaped with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) life, the other slaves would soon copy the example; the result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves, and the enslavement of the whites.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) reply was, -LRB-as well as I can remember,-RRB- that Demby had become unmanageable. Mr. Gore's defence was satisfactory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Demby</b></font>) was continued in his (<font color='blue'><b>Demby</b></font>) station as overseer upon the home plantation.
<p/>It was committed in the presence of slaves, and they of course could neither institute a suit, nor testify against him (<font color='blue'><b>Demby</b></font>); and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the community in which he (<font color='blue'><b>perpetrator</b></font>) lives.
<p/>Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael's, Talbot county, Maryland, when I left there; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) is still alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) very probably lives there now; and if so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) is now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) was then, as highly esteemed and as much respected as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) guilty soul had not been stained with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gore</b></font>) brother's blood.
<p/>I speak advisedly when I say this,--that killing a slave, or any colored person, in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either by the courts or the community.
<p/>Mr. Thomas Lanman, of St. Michael's, killed two slaves, one of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) killed with a hatchet, by knocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) brains out.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fame as an overseer went abroad. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) used to boast of the commission of the awful and bloody deed.
<p/>I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) do so laughingly, saying, among other things, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was the only benefactor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) country in the company, and that when others would do as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had done, we should be relieved of <div class="bookquote">``the d--d niggers.
<p/>The wife of Mr. Giles Hicks, living but a short distance from where I used to live, murdered my wife's cousin, a young girl between fifteen and sixteen years of age, mangling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) person in the most horrible manner, breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nose and breastbone with a stick, so that the poor girl expired in a few hours afterward.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was immediately buried, but had not been in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) untimely grave but a few hours before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was taken up and examined by the coroner, who decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) death by severe beating.
<p/>The offence for which this girl was thus murdered was this:--She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been set that night to mind Mrs. Hicks's baby, and during the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) fell asleep, and the baby cried.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>), having lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) rest for several nights previous, did not hear the crying. They were both in the room with Mrs. Hicks.
<p/>Mrs. Hicks, finding the girl slow to move, jumped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) bed, seized an oak stick of wood by the fireplace, and with it broke the girl's nose and breastbone, and thus ended her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life.
<p/>I will not say that this most horrid murder produced no sensation in the community. It did produce sensation, but not enough to bring the murderess to punishment.
<p/>There was a warrant issued for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arrest, but it was never served. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) escaped not only punishment, but even the pain of being arraigned before a court for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) horrid crime.
<p/>Whilst I am detailing bloody deeds which took place during my stay on Colonel Lloyd's plantation, I will briefly narrate another, which occurred about the same time as the murder of Demby by Mr. Gore.
<p/>Colonel Lloyd's slaves were in the habit of spending a part of their nights and Sundays in fishing for oysters, and in this way made up the deficiency of their scanty allowance.
<p/>An old man belonging to Colonel Lloyd, while thus engaged, happened to get beyond the limits of Colonel Lloyd's, and on the premises of Mr. Beal Bondly.
<p/>At this trespass, Mr. Bondly took offence, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bondly</b></font>) musket came down to the shore, and blew its deadly contents into the poor old man.
<p/>Mr. Bondly came over to see Colonel Lloyd the next day, whether to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) property, or to justify himself in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had done, I know not.
<p/>At any rate, this whole fiendish transaction was soon hushed up. There was very little said about it at all, and nothing done.
<p/>It was a common saying, even among little white boys, that it was worth a half-cent to kill a <div class="bookquote">``nigger,''  (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div>and a half-cent to bury one.
<p/>As to my own treatment while I lived on Colonel Lloyd's plantation, it was very similar to that of the other slave children.
<p/>I was not old enough to work in the field, and there being little else than field work to do, I had a great deal of leisure time.
<p/>The most I had to do was to drive up the cows at evening, keep the fowls out of the garden, keep the front yard clean, and run of errands for my old master's daughter, Mrs. Lucretia Auld.
<p/>The most of my leisure time I spent in helping Master Daniel Lloyd in finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) birds, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) had shot them.
<p/>CHAPTER V My connection with Master Daniel was of some advantage to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) became quite attached to me, and was a sort of protector of me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) would not allow the older boys to impose upon me, and would divide his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) cakes with me. I was seldom whipped by my old master, and suffered little from any thing else than hunger and cold.
<p/>In hottest summer and coldest winter, I was kept almost naked--no shoes, no stockings, no jacket, no trousers, nothing on but a coarse tow linen shirt, reaching only to my knees.
<p/>I must have perished with cold, but that, the coldest nights, I used to steal a bag which was used for carrying corn to the mill.
<p/>I would crawl into this bag, and there sleep on the cold, damp, clay floor, with my head in and feet out.
<p/>My feet have been so cracked with the frost, that the pen with which I am writing might be laid in the gashes.
<p/>I suffered much from hunger, but much more from cold. I had no bed. We were not regularly allowanced. Our food was coarse corn meal boiled.
<p/>This was called mush . It was put into a large wooden tray or trough, and set down upon the ground.
<p/>The children were then called, like so many pigs, and like so many pigs they would come and devour the mush; some with oyster-shells, others with pieces of shingle, some with naked hands, and none with spoons.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) that ate fastest got most; he (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) that was strongest secured the best place; and few left the trough satisfied. I was probably between seven and eight years old when I left Colonel Lloyd's plantation.
<p/>I shall never forget the ecstasy with which I received the intelligence that my old master -LRB-Anthony-RRB- had determined to let me go to Baltimore, to live with Mr. Hugh Auld, brother to my old master's son-in-law, Captain Thomas Auld.
<p/>I left it with joy. I received this information about three days before my departure. They were three of the happiest days I ever enjoyed.
<p/>I spent the most part of all these three days in the creek, washing off the plantation scurf, and preparing myself for my departure.
<p/>I spent the time in washing, not so much because I wished to, but because Mrs. Lucretia had told me I must get all the dead skin off my feet and knees before I could go to Baltimore; for the people in Baltimore were very cleanly, and would laugh at me if I looked dirty.
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) was going to give me a pair of trousers, which I should not put on unless I got all the dirt off me.
<p/>The pride of appearance which this would indicate was not my own. The thought of owning a pair of trousers was great indeed!
<p/>It was almost a sufficient motive, not only to make me take off what would be called by pig-drovers the mange, but the skin itself.
<p/>I went at it in good earnest, working for the first time with the hope of reward. The ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all suspended in my case.
<p/>; on parting from it, I could not feel that I was leaving any thing which I could have enjoyed by staying.
<p/>I found no severe trial in my departure. My home was charmless; it was not home to me My mother was dead, my grandmother lived far off, so that I seldom saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>I had two sisters and one brother, that lived in the same house with me; but the early separation of us from our mother had well nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories.
<p/>I looked for home elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one which I was leaving.
<p/>If, however, I found in my new home hardship, hunger, whipping, and nakedness, I had the consolation that I should not have escaped any one of them by staying.
<p/>Having already had more than a taste of them in the house of my old master, and having endured them there, I very naturally inferred my ability to endure them elsewhere, and especially at Baltimore; for I had something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the proverb, that <div class="bookquote">``being hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural death in Ireland.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore. Cousin Tom, though not fluent in speech, had inspired me with that desire by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eloquent description of the place.
<p/>I could never point out any thing at the Great House, no matter how beautiful or powerful, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) had seen something at Baltimore far exceeding, both in beauty and strength, the object which I pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>).
<p/>So strong was my desire, that I thought a gratification of it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should sustain by the exchange.
<p/>Even the Great House itself, with all its pictures, was far inferior to many buildings in Baltimore. I left without a regret, and with the highest hopes of future happiness.
<p/>I remember only the day of the week, for at that time I had no knowledge of the days of the month, nor the months of the year.
<p/>We sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning. On setting sail, I walked aft, and gave to Colonel Lloyd's plantation what I hoped would be the last look.
<p/>I then placed myself in the bows of the sloop, and there spent the remainder of the day in looking ahead, interesting myself in what was in the distance rather than in things near by or behind.
<p/>In the afternoon of that day, we reached Annapolis, the capital of the State. We stopped but a few moments, so that I had no time to go on shore.
<p/>It was the first large town that I had ever seen, and though it would look small compared with some of our New England factory villages, I thought it a wonderful place for its size--more imposing even than the Great House Farm!
<p/>We had on board the sloop a large flock of sheep; and after aiding in driving them to the slaughterhouse of Mr. Curtis on Louden Slater's Hill, I was conducted by Rich, one of the hands belonging on board of the sloop, to my new home in Alliciana Street, near Mr. Gardner's ship-yard, on Fells Point.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Auld were both at home, and met me at the door with their little son Thomas, to take care of whom I had been given.
<p/>And here I saw what I had never seen before; it was a white face beaming with the most kindly emotions; it was the face of my new mistress, Sophia Auld.
<p/>We arrived at Baltimore early on Sunday morning, landing at Smith's Wharf, not far from Bowley's Wharf. I wish I could describe the rapture that flashed through my soul as I beheld it.
<p/>It was a new and strange sight to me, brightening up my pathway with the light of happiness. Little Thomas was told, there was his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) Freddy,--and
<p/>I was told to take care of little Thomas; and thus I entered upon the duties of my new home with the most cheering prospect ahead.
<p/>It is possible, and even quite probable, that but for the mere circumstance of being removed from that plantation to Baltimore, I should have to-day, instead of being here seated by my own table, in the enjoyment of freedom and the happiness of home, writing this Narrative, been confined in the galling chains of slavery.
<p/>I look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd's plantation as one of the most interesting events of my life. Going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation, and opened the gateway, to all my subsequent prosperity.
<p/>I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has ever since attended me, and marked my life with so many favors.
<p/>I regarded the selection of myself as being somewhat remarkable. There were a number of slave children that might have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore.
<p/>There were those younger, those older, and those of the same age. I was chosen from among them all, and was the first, last, and only choice.
<p/>I may be deemed superstitious, and even egotistical, in regarding this event as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor.
<p/>I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and incur my own abhorrence.
<p/>From my earliest recollection, I date the entertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace; and in the darkest hours of my career in slavery, this living word of faith and spirit of hope departed not from me, but remained like ministering angels to cheer me through the gloom.
<p/>But I should be false to the earliest sentiments of my soul, if I suppressed the opinion. This good spirit was from God, and to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) I offer thanksgiving and praise.
<p/>My new mistress proved to be all she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) appeared when I first met her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) at the door,--a woman of the kindest heart and finest feelings.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had never had a slave under her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) control previously to myself, and prior to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had been dependent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) own industry for a living.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was by trade a weaver; and by constant application to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) business, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had been in a good degree preserved from the blighting and dehumanizing effects of slavery.
<p/>CHAPTER VI I was utterly astonished at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) goodness. I scarcely knew how to behave towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was entirely unlike any other white woman I had ever seen.
<p/>I could not approach her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) as I was accustomed to approach other white ladies. My early instruction was all out of place.
<p/>The crouching servility, usually so acceptable a quality in a slave, did not answer when manifested toward her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) favor was not gained by it; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) seemed to be disturbed by it.
<p/>The meanest slave was put fully at ease in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) presence, and none left without feeling better for having seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did not deem it impudent or unmannerly for a slave to look her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in the face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face was made of heavenly smiles, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) voice of tranquil music.
<p/>But, alas! this kind heart had but a short time to remain such. The fatal poison of irresponsible power was already in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hands, and soon commenced its infernal work.
<p/>That cheerful eye, under the influence of slavery, soon became red with rage; that voice, made all of sweet accord, changed to one of harsh and horrid discord; and that angelic face gave place to that of a demon.
<p/>Very soon after I went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Auld, she (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) very kindly commenced to teach me the A, B, C.
<p/>Just at this point of my progress, Mr. Auld found out what was going on, and at once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct me further, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>), among other things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a slave to read.
<p/>After I had learned this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters. To use his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) own words, further, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``If you give a nigger an inch, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) will take an ell.
<p/>A nigger should know nothing but to obey his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) master--to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) is told to do. Learning would spoil the best nigger in the world.
<p/>Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if you teach that nigger -LRB-speaking of myself-RRB- how to read, there would be no keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>). It would forever unfit him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) to be a slave.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) would at once become unmanageable, and of no value to his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) master. As to himself, it could do him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) no good, but a great deal of harm.
<p/>These words sank deep into my heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering, and called into existence an entirely new train of thought.
<p/>It was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things, with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in vain.
<p/>I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty--to wit, the white man's power to enslave the black man.
<p/>It would make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discontented and unhappy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom.
<p/>Whilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind mistress, I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which, by the merest accident, I had gained from my master.
<p/>Though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read.
<p/>The very decided manner with which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) spoke, and strove to impress his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wife with the evil consequences of giving me instruction, served to convince me that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was deeply sensible of the truths he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was uttering.
<p/>It gave me the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, would flow from teaching me to read.
<p/>It was just what I wanted, and I got it at a time when I the least expected it. What he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) most dreaded, that I most desired.
<p/>That which to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a great evil, to be carefully shunned, was to me a great good, to be diligently sought; and the argument which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) so warmly urged, against my learning to read, only served to inspire me with a desire and determination to learn.
<p/>In learning to read, I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly aid of my mistress.
<p/>I had resided but a short time in Baltimore before I observed a marked difference, in the treatment of slaves, from that which I had witnessed in the country.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) most loved, that I most hated. I acknowledge the benefit of both. A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave on the plantation.
<p/>There is a vestige of decency, a sense of shame, that does much to curb and check those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the plantation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is a desperate slaveholder, who will shock the humanity of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) lacerated slave.
<p/>Few are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputation of being a cruel master; and above all things, they would not be known as not giving a slave enough to eat.
<p/>Every city slaveholder is anxious to have it known of him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) feeds his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) slaves well; and it is due to them to say, that most of them do give their slaves enough to eat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is much better fed and clothed, and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation. There are, however, some painful exceptions to this rule.
<p/>Directly opposite to us, on Philpot Street, lived Mr. Thomas Hamilton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) owned two slaves. Their names were Henrietta and Mary.
<p/>Henrietta was about twenty-two years of age, Mary was about fourteen; and of all the mangled and emaciated creatures I ever looked upon, these two were the most so.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) heart must be harder than stone, that could look upon these unmoved. The head, neck, and shoulders of Mary were literally cut to pieces.
<p/>I have frequently felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head, and found it nearly covered with festering sores, caused by the lash of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cruel mistress.
<p/>I do not know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) master ever whipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but I have been an eye-witness to the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton.
<p/>Mrs. Hamilton used to sit in a large chair in the middle of the room, with a heavy cowskin always by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) side, and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the blood of one of these slaves.
<p/>I used to be in Mr. Hamilton's house nearly every day. The girls seldom passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) without her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) saying, <div class="bookquote">``Move faster, you black gip!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div>at the same time giving them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders, often drawing the blood.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) would then say, <div class="bookquote">``Take that, you black gip! ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>continuing, <div class="bookquote">``If you don't move faster, I'll move you!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Added to the cruel lashings to which these slaves were subjected, they were kept nearly half-starved.
<p/>They seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal. I have seen Mary contending with the pigs for the offal thrown into the street.
<p/>So much was Mary kicked and cut to pieces, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was oftener called '' pecked '' than by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) name.
<p/>CHAPTER VII I lived in Master Hugh's family about seven years. During this time, I succeeded in learning to read and write.
<p/>My mistress, who had kindly commenced to instruct me, had, in compliance with the advice and direction of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) husband, not only ceased to instruct, but had set her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face against my being instructed by any one else.
<p/>It is due, however, to my mistress to say of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did not adopt this course of treatment immediately.
<p/>In accomplishing this, I was compelled to resort to various stratagems. I had no regular teacher. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) at first lacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness.
<p/>It was at least necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to have some training in the exercise of irresponsible power, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) equal to the task of treating me as though I were a brute.
<p/>My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) commenced, when I first went to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to treat me as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) supposed one human being ought to treat another.
<p/>In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so.
<p/>Slavery proved as injurious to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as it did to me. When I went there, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman.
<p/>There was no sorrow or suffering for which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not a tear. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reach.
<p/>Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness.
<p/>The first step in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) downward course was in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ceasing to instruct me. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now commenced to practise her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's precepts.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finally became even more violent in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opposition than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had commanded; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed anxious to do better.
<p/>Nothing seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more angry than to see me with a newspaper. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed to think that here lay the danger.
<p/>I have had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rush at me with a face made all up of fury, and snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that fully revealed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) apprehension.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was an apt woman; and a little experience soon demonstrated, to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) satisfaction, that education and slavery were incompatible with each other.
<p/>If I was in a separate room any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a book, and was at once called to give an account of myself.
<p/>Mistress, in teaching me the alphabet, had given me the inch, and no precaution could prevent me from taking the ell.
<p/>The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street.
<p/>From this time I was most narrowly watched. All this, however, was too late. The first step had been taken. As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers.
<p/>When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return.
<p/>I used also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood.
<p/>This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge.
<p/>I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;--not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country.
<p/>It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard.
<p/>With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read. I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them.
<p/>I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men.
<p/>'' You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life! Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?''
<p/>These words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free.
<p/>I was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being a slave for life began to bear heavily upon my heart.
<p/>Just about this time, I got hold of a book entitled <div class="bookquote">``The Columbian Orator. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Every opportunity I got, I used to read this book.
<p/>Among much of other interesting matter, I found in it a dialogue between a master and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) slave. The slave was represented as having run away from his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master three times.
<p/>In this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the slave.
<p/>The slave was made to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master--things which had the desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master.
<p/>The dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them, when the slave was retaken the third time. In the same book, I met with one of Sheridan's mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic emancipation.
<p/>They gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently flashed through my mind, and died away for want of utterance.
<p/>These were choice documents to me. I read them over and over again with unabated interest. The moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder.
<p/>The reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery; but while they relieved me of one difficulty, they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I was relieved.
<p/>What I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery, and a powerful vindication of human rights. The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers.
<p/>I could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers, who had left their homes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land reduced us to slavery.
<p/>I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men. As I read and contemplated the subject, behold!
<p/>that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come, to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish.
<p/>As I writhed under it, I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing.
<p/>It had given me a view of my wretched condition, without the remedy. It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get out.
<p/>In moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own.
<p/>Any thing, no matter what, to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me.
<p/>There was no getting rid of it. It was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or inanimate.
<p/>The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was heard in every sound, and seen in every thing.
<p/>It was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and felt nothing without feeling it.
<p/>I often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself dead; and but for the hope of being free, I have no doubt but that I should have killed myself, or done something for which I should have been killed.
<p/>It looked from every star, it smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every storm. While in this state of mind, I was eager to hear any one speak of slavery.
<p/>I was a ready listener. Every little while, I could hear something about the abolitionists. It was some time before I found what the word meant.
<p/>If a slave ran away and succeeded in getting clear, or if a slave killed his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master, set fire to a barn, or did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder, it was spoken of as the fruit of abolition.
<p/>It was always used in such connections as to make it an interesting word to me. Hearing the word in this connection very often, I set about learning what it meant.
<p/>The dictionary afforded me little or no help. I found it was <div class="bookquote">``the act of abolishing; ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but then I did not know what was to be abolished.
<p/>I did not dare to ask any one about its meaning, for I was satisfied that it was something they wanted me to know very little about.
<p/>After a patient waiting, I got one of our city papers, containing an account of the number of petitions from the north, praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and of the slave trade between the States.
<p/>From this time I understood the words abolition and abolitionist, and always drew near when that word was spoken, expecting to hear something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves.
<p/>I went one day down on the wharf of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone, I went, unasked, and helped them.
<p/>Here I was perplexed. The light broke in upon me by degrees. When we had finished, one of them came to me and asked me if I were a slave.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) I was. He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``Are ye a slave for life? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) that I was. The good Irishman seemed to be deeply affected by the statement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) said to the other that it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for life.
<p/>They both advised me to run away to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I should be free.
<p/>I pretended not to be interested in what they said, and treated them as if I did not understand them; for I feared they might be treacherous.
<p/>White men have been known to encourage slaves to escape, and then, to get the reward, catch them and return them to their masters.
<p/>I was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me so; but I nevertheless remembered their advice, and from that time I resolved to run away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) said it was a shame to hold me. I looked forward to a time at which it would be safe for me to escape.
<p/>I was too young to think of doing so immediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, as I might have occasion to write my own pass.
<p/>I consoled myself with the hope that I should one day find a good chance. Meanwhile, I would learn to write.
<p/>The idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by being in Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard, and frequently seeing the ship carpenters, after hewing, and getting a piece of timber ready for use, write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was intended.
<p/>When a piece of timber was intended for the larboard side, it would be marked thus--<div class="bookquote">``L. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>When a piece was for the starboard side, it would be marked thus--<div class="bookquote">``S.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A piece for the larboard side forward, would be marked thus--<div class="bookquote">``L. F. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>When a piece was for starboard side forward, it would be marked thus--<div class="bookquote">``S. F.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I soon learned the names of these letters, and for what they were intended when placed upon a piece of timber in the ship-yard.
<p/>'' For larboard aft, it would be marked thus--<div class="bookquote">``L. A. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>For starboard aft, it would be marked thus--``S. A. I immediately commenced copying them, and in a short time was able to make the four letters named.
<p/>After that, when I met with any boy who I knew could write, I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) I could write as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>I would then make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to beat that.
<p/>In this way I got a good many lessons in writing, which it is quite possible I should never have gotten in any other way.
<p/>During this time, my copy-book was the board fence, brick wall, and pavement; my pen and ink was a lump of chalk.
<p/>The next word would be, <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you. Let me see you try it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>With these, I learned mainly how to write.
<p/>I then commenced and continued copying the Italics in Webster's Spelling Book, until I could make them all without looking on the book.
<p/>By this time, my little Master Thomas had gone to school, and learned how to write, and had written over a number of copy-books.
<p/>My mistress used to go to class meeting at the Wilk Street meetinghouse every Monday afternoon, and leave me to take care of the house.
<p/>When left thus, I used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left in Master Thomas's copy-book, copying what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had written.
<p/>These had been brought home, and shown to some of our near neighbors, and then laid aside. I continued to do this until I could write a hand very similar to that of Master Thomas.
<p/>In a very short time after I went to live at Baltimore, my old master's youngest son Richard died; and in about three years and six months after his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) death, my old master, Captain Anthony, died, leaving only his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) son, Andrew, and daughter, Lucretia, to share his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) estate.
<p/>Thus, after a long, tedious effort for years, I finally succeeded in learning how to write. CHAPTER VIII He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) died while on a visit to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) daughter at Hillsborough.
<p/>It was therefore necessary to have a valuation of the property, that it might be equally divided between Mrs. Lucretia and Master Andrew.
<p/>Cut off thus unexpectedly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) left no will as to the disposal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) property. I was immediately sent for, to be valued with the other property.
<p/>Here again my feelings rose up in detestation of slavery. I had now a new conception of my degraded condition. Prior to this, I had become, if not insensible to my lot, at least partly so.
<p/>I took passage with Captain Rowe, in the schooner Wild Cat, and, after a sail of about twenty-four hours, I found myself near the place of my birth.
<p/>I left Baltimore with a young heart overborne with sadness, and a soul full of apprehension. I had now been absent from it almost, if not quite, five years.
<p/>I was only about five years old when I left it, to go and live with my old master on Colonel Lloyd's plantation; so that I was now between ten and eleven years old.
<p/>I, however, remembered the place very well. We were all ranked together at the valuation. Men and women, old and young, married and single, were ranked with horses, sheep, and swine.
<p/>There were horses and men, cattle and women, pigs and children, all holding the same rank in the scale of being, and were all subjected to the same narrow examination.
<p/>Silvery-headed age and sprightly youth, maids and matrons, had to undergo the same indelicate inspection. At this moment, I saw more clearly than ever the brutalizing effects of slavery upon both slave and slaveholder.
<p/>I have no language to express the high excitement and deep anxiety which were felt among us poor slaves during this time.
<p/>After the valuation, then came the division. Our fate for life was now to be decided. we had no more voice in that decision than the brutes among whom we were ranked.
<p/>A single word from the white men was enough--against all our wishes, prayers, and entreaties--to sunder forever the dearest friends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties known to human beings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was known to us all as being a most cruel wretch,--a common drunkard, who had, by his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) reckless mismanagement and profligate dissipation, already wasted a large portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) father's property.
<p/>We all felt that we might as well be sold at once to the Georgia traders, as to pass into his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) hands; for we knew that that would be our inevitable condition,--a condition held by us all in the utmost horror and dread.
<p/>In addition to the pain of separation, there was the horrid dread of falling into the hands of Master Andrew. I suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-slaves.
<p/>I had known what it was to be kindly treated; they had known nothing of the kind. They had seen little or nothing of the world.
<p/>Their backs had been made familiar with the bloody lash, so that they had become callous; mine was yet tender; for while at Baltimore I got few whippings, and few slaves could boast of a kinder master and mistress than myself; and the thought of passing out of their hands into those of Master Andrew--a man who, but a few days before, to give me a sample of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bloody disposition, took my little brother by the throat, threw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the ground, and with the heel of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boot stamped upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head till the blood gushed from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose and ears--was well calculated to make me anxious as to my fate.
<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had committed this savage outrage upon my brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to me, and said that was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant to serve me one of these days,--meaning, I suppose, when I came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possession.
<p/>Thanks to a kind Providence, I fell to the portion of Mrs. Lucretia, and was sent immediately back to Baltimore, to live again in the family of Master Hugh.
<p/>They were in very deed men and women of sorrow, and acquainted with grief. Their joy at my return equalled their sorrow at my departure.
<p/>I was absent from Baltimore, for the purpose of valuation and division, just about one month, and it seemed to have been six.
<p/>Very soon after my return to Baltimore, my mistress, Lucretia, died, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) husband and one child, Amanda; and in a very short time after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) death, Master Andrew died.
<p/>Now all the property of my old master, slaves included, was in the hands of strangers,--strangers who had had nothing to do with accumulating it.
<p/>It was a glad day to me. I had escaped a worse than lion's jaws. Not a slave was left free.
<p/>If any one thing in my experience, more than another, served to deepen my conviction of the infernal character of slavery, and to fill me with unutterable loathing of slaveholders, it was their base ingratitude to my poor old grandmother.
<p/>All remained slaves, from the youngest to the oldest. She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) had served my old master faithfully from youth to old age.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) had been the source of all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wealth; she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) had peopled his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) plantation with slaves; she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) had become a great grandmother in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) service.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) had rocked him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in infancy, attended him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in childhood, served him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) through life, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) death wiped from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) icy brow the cold death-sweat, and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes forever.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was nevertheless left a slave--a slave for life--a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their hands she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) children, her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) grandchildren, and her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) great-grandchildren, divided, like so many sheep, without being gratified with the small privilege of a single word, as to their or her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) own destiny.
<p/>And, to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having outlived my old master and all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) children, having seen the beginning and end of all of them, and her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) present owners finding she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was of but little value, her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) frame already racked with the pains of old age, and complete helplessness fast stealing over her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) once active limbs, they took her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) to the woods, built her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) a little hut, put up a little mud-chimney, and then made her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) out to die!
<p/>If my poor old grandmother now lives, she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) lives to suffer in utter loneliness; she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children, the loss of grandchildren, and the loss of great-grandchildren.
<p/>They are, in the language of the slave's poet, Whittier,-- <div class="bookquote">``Gone, gone, sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone, Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings, Where the noisome insect stings, Where the fever-demon strews Poison with the falling dews, Where the sickly sunbeams glare Through the hot and misty air:-- Gone, gone, sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone, From Virginia hills and waters-- Woe is me, my stolen daughters!''
 (<font color='red'><b>slave poet Whittier</b></font>)</div><p/>The hearth is desolate. The children, the unconscious children, who once sang and danced in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) presence, are gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) gropes her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) way, in the darkness of age, for a drink of water.
<p/>Instead of the voices of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) children, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hears by day the moans of the dove, and by night the screams of the hideous owl.
<p/>And now, when weighed down by the pains and aches of old age, when the head inclines to the feet, when the beginning and ending of human existence meet, and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together--at this time, this most needful time, the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection which children only can exercise towards a declining parent--my poor old grandmother, the devoted mother of twelve children, is left all alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim embers.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) staggers--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) falls--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) groans--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dies--and there are none of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children or grandchildren present, to wipe from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wrinkled brow the cold sweat of death, or to place beneath the sod her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fallen remains.
<p/>All is gloom. The grave is at the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stands--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sits-- Will not a righteous God visit for these things?
<p/>In about two years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, Master Thomas married his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) second wife. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) name was Rowena Hamilton.
<p/>Not long after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) marriage, a misunderstanding took place between himself and Master Hugh; and as a means of punishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) took me from him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) to live with himself at St. Michael's.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) was the eldest daughter of Mr. William Hamilton. Master now lived in St. Michael's. Here I underwent another most painful separation.
<p/>It, however, was not so severe as the one I dreaded at the division of property; for, during this interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) once kind and affectionate wife.
<p/>The influence of brandy upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>), and of slavery upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both; so that, as far as they were concerned, I thought I had little to lose by the change.
<p/>But it was not to them that I was attached. It was to those little Baltimore boys that I felt the strongest attachment.
<p/>I had received many good lessons from them, and was still receiving them, and the thought of leaving them was painful indeed.
<p/>I was leaving, too, without the hope of ever being allowed to return. Master Thomas had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would never let me return again.
<p/>I then had to regret that I did not at least make the attempt to carry out my resolution to run away; for the chances of success are tenfold greater from the city than from the country.
<p/>The barrier betwixt himself and brother he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) considered impassable. I sailed from Baltimore for St. Michael's in the sloop Amanda, Captain Edward Dodson.
<p/>On my passage, I paid particular attention to the direction which the steamboats took to go to Philadelphia. I found, instead of going down, on reaching North Point they went up the bay, in a north-easterly direction.
<p/>I deemed this knowledge of the utmost importance. My determination to run away was again revived. I resolved to wait only so long as the offering of a favorable opportunity.
<p/>When that came, I was determined to be off. CHAPTER IX I have now reached a period of my life when I can give dates.
<p/>It was now more than seven years since I lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in the family of my old master, on Colonel Lloyd's plantation.
<p/>I left Baltimore, and went to live with Master Thomas Auld, at St. Michael's, in March, 1832. We of course were now almost entire strangers to each other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was to me a new master, and I to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a new slave. I was ignorant of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) temper and disposition; he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was equally so of mine.
<p/>A very short time, however, brought us into full acquaintance with each other. I was made acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife not less than with himself.
<p/>I was now, for the first time during a space of more than seven years, made to feel the painful gnawings of hunger--a something which I had not experienced before since I left Colonel Lloyd's plantation.
<p/>It went hard enough with me then, when I could look back to no period at which I had enjoyed a sufficiency.
<p/>It was tenfold harder after living in Master Hugh's family, where I had always had enough to eat, and of that which was good.
<p/>They were well matched, being equally mean and cruel. I have said Master Thomas was a mean man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was so.
<p/>Not to give a slave enough to eat, is regarded as the most aggravated development of meanness even among slaveholders. The rule is, no matter how coarse the food, only let there be enough of it.
<p/>This is the theory; and in the part of Maryland from which I came, it is the general practice,--though there are many exceptions.
<p/>There were four slaves of us in the kitchen--my sister Eliza, my aunt Priscilla, Henny, and myself; and we were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal per week, and very little else, either in the shape of meat or vegetables.
<p/>Master Thomas gave us enough of neither coarse nor fine food. It was not enough for us to subsist upon. We were therefore reduced to the wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors.
<p/>This we did by begging and stealing, whichever came handy in the time of need, the one being considered as legitimate as the other.
<p/>A great many times have we poor creatures been nearly perishing with hunger, when food in abundance lay mouldering in the safe and smoke-house, and our pious mistress was aware of the fact; and yet that mistress and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) husband would kneel every morning, and pray that God would bless them in basket and store!
<p/>Bad as all slaveholders are, we seldom meet one destitute of every element of character commanding respect. My master was one of this rare sort.
<p/>The leading trait in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) character was meanness; and if there were any other element in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) nature, it was made subject to this.
<p/>I do not know of one single noble act ever performed by him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was mean; and, like most other mean men, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lacked the ability to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) meanness.
<p/>Captain Auld was not born a slaveholder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) had been a poor man, master only of a Bay craft. He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) came into possession of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) slaves by marriage; and of all men, adopted slaveholders are the worst.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) was cruel, but cowardly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) commanded without firmness. In the enforcement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) rules, he (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) was at times rigid, and at times lax.
<p/>At times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) slaves with the firmness of Napoleon and the fury of a demon; at other times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) might well be mistaken for an inquirer who had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) did nothing of himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) might have passed for a lion, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) ears. In all things noble which he (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) attempted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) own meanness shone most conspicuous.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) airs, words, and actions, were the airs, words, and actions of born slaveholders, and, being assumed, were awkward enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) was not even a good imitator.
<p/>Having no resources within himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) was compelled to be the copyist of many, and being such, he (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) was forever the victim of inconsistency; and of consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) was an object of contempt, and was held as such even by his (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) slaves.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) possessed all the disposition to deceive, but wanted the power. The luxury of having slaves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) own to wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) was something new and unprepared for.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) was a slaveholder without the ability to hold slaves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) found himself incapable of managing his (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) slaves either by force, fear, or fraud.
<p/>We seldom called him (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``master;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>we generally called him (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Captain Auld,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and were hardly disposed to title him (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) at all. I doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making him (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) appear awkward, and of consequence fretful.
<p/>Our want of reverence for him (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) must have perplexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) greatly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) wished to have us call him (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) master, but lacked the firmness necessary to command us to do so.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) wife used to insist upon our calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Auld</b></font>) so, but to no purpose. In August, 1832, my master attended a Methodist camp-meeting held in the Bay-side, Talbot county, and there experienced religion.
<p/>I indulged a faint hope that his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) conversion would lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) to emancipate his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) slaves, and that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) did not do this, it would, at any rate, make him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) more kind and humane.
<p/>I was disappointed in both these respects. It neither made him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) to be humane to his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) slaves, nor to emancipate them.
<p/>If it had any effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) character, it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) more cruel and hateful in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) ways; for I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) to have been a much worse man after his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) conversion than before.
<p/>Prior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) conversion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) relied upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) own depravity to shield and sustain him (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) savage barbarity; but after his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) conversion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) found religious sanction and support for his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) slaveholding cruelty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) made the greatest pretensions to piety. His (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) house was the house of prayer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) prayed morning, noon, and night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) very soon distinguished himself among his (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) brethren, and was soon made a class-leader and exhorter.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) activity in revivals was great, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) proved himself an instrument in the hands of the church in converting many souls.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) house was the preachers' home. They used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up; for while he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) starved us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Talbot</b></font>) stuffed them.
<p/>The names of those who used to come most frequently while I lived there, were Mr. Storks, Mr. Ewery, Mr. Humphry, and Mr. Hickey.
<p/>We have had three or four preachers there at a time. I have also seen Mr. George Cookman at our house.
<p/>We thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) instrumental in getting Mr. Samuel Harrison, a very rich slaveholder, to emancipate his (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) slaves; and by some means got the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the slaves.
<p/>We slaves loved Mr. Cookman. We believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Cookman</b></font>) to be a good man. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Cookman</b></font>) was at our house, we were sure to be called in to prayers.
<p/>When the others were there, we were sometimes called in and sometimes not. Mr. Cookman took more notice of us than either of the other ministers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cookman</b></font>) could not come among us without betraying his (<font color='blue'><b>Cookman</b></font>) sympathy for us, and, stupid as we were, we had the sagacity to see it.
<p/>While I lived with my master in St. Michael's, there was a white young man, a Mr. Wilson, who proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the instruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the New Testament.
<p/>We met but three times, when Mr. West and Mr. Fairbanks, both class-leaders, with many others, came upon us with sticks and other missiles, drove us off, and forbade us to meet again.
<p/>Thus ended our little Sabbath school in the pious town of St. Michael's. I have said my master found religious sanction for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cruelty.
<p/>I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tie up a lame young woman, and whip her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a heavy cowskin upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) naked shoulders, causing the warm red blood to drip; and, in justification of the bloody deed, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would quote this passage of Scripture--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) that knoweth his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) master's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.
<p/>As an example, I will state one of many facts going to prove the charge. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Master would keep this lacerated young woman tied up in this horrid situation four or five hours at a time.
<p/>I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) to tie her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up early in the morning, and whip her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) before breakfast; leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) store, return at dinner, and whip her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again, cutting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the places already made raw with his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) cruel lash.
<p/>The secret of master's cruelty toward <div class="bookquote">``Henny''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>is found in the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being almost helpless. When quite a child, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell into the fire, and burned herself horribly.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands were so burnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never got the use of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could do very little but bear heavy burdens.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was to master a bill of expense; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was a mean man, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a constant offence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) seemed desirous of getting the poor girl out of existence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) away once to his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) sister; but, being a poor gift, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not disposed to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Here was a recently-converted man, holding on upon the mother, and at the same time turning out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) helpless child, to starve and die!
<p/>Master Thomas was one of the many pious slaveholders who hold slaves for the very charitable purpose of taking care of them.
<p/>Finally, my benevolent master, to use his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own words, <div class="bookquote">``set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) adrift to take care of herself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>My master and myself had quite a number of differences.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) found me unsuitable to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) purpose. My city life, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, had had a very pernicious effect upon me. It had almost ruined me for every good purpose, and fitted me for every thing which was bad.
<p/>One of my greatest faults was that of letting his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) horse run away, and go down to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) father-inlaw's farm, which was about five miles from St. Michael's.
<p/>My reason for this kind of carelessness, or carefulness, was, that I could always get something to eat when I went there.
<p/>I would then have to go after it. Master William Hamilton, my master's father-in-law, always gave his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) slaves enough to eat.
<p/>I never left there hungry, no matter how great the need of my speedy return. Master Thomas at length said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would stand it no longer.
<p/>I had lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) nine months, during which time he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had given me a number of severe whippings, all to no good purpose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) resolved to put me out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) said, to be broken; and, for this purpose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) let me for one year to a man named Edward Covey.
<p/>Mr. Covey was a poor man, a farm-renter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) rented the place upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) lived, as also the hands with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) tilled it.
<p/>Mr. Covey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young slaves, and this reputation was of immense value to him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>).
<p/>It enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) farm tilled with much less expense to himself than he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) could have had it done without such a reputation.
<p/>Some slaveholders thought it not much loss to allow Mr. Covey to have their slaves one year, for the sake of the training to which they were subjected, without any other compensation.
<p/>Added to the natural good qualities of Mr. Covey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was a professor of religion--a pious soul--a member and a class-leader in the Methodist church.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) could hire young help with great ease, in consequence of this reputation. All of this added weight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) reputation as a <div class="bookquote">``nigger-breaker.
<p/>I was aware of all the facts, having been made acquainted with them by a young man who had lived there.
<p/>I nevertheless made the change gladly; for I was sure of getting enough to eat, which is not the smallest consideration to a hungry man.
<p/>CHAPTER X I had left Master Thomas's house, and went to live with Mr. Covey, on the 1st of January, 1833.
<p/>In my new employment, I found myself even more awkward than a country boy appeared to be in a large city.
<p/>I had been at my new home but one week before Mr. Covey gave me a very severe whipping, cutting my back, causing the blood to run, and raising ridges on my flesh as large as my little finger.
<p/>The details of this affair are as follows: Mr. Covey sent me, very early in the morning of one of our coldest days in the month of January, to the woods, to get a load of wood.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was now, for the first time in my life, a field hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) gave me a team of unbroken oxen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) then tied the end of a large rope around the horns of the in-hand ox, and gave me the other end of it, and told me, if the oxen started to run, that I must hold on upon the rope.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) told me which was the in-hand ox, and which the off-hand one. I had never driven oxen before, and of course I was very awkward.
<p/>I, however, succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty; but I had got a very few rods into the woods, when the oxen took fright, and started full tilt, carrying the cart against trees, and over stumps, in the most frightful manner.
<p/>After running thus for a considerable distance, they finally upset the cart, dashing it with great force against a tree, and threw themselves into a dense thicket.
<p/>I expected every moment that my brains would be dashed out against the trees. How I escaped death, I do not know.
<p/>My cart was upset and shattered, my oxen were entangled among the young trees, and there was none to help me.
<p/>After a long spell of effort, I succeeded in getting my cart righted, my oxen disentangled, and again yoked to the cart.
<p/>I now proceeded with my team to the place where I had, the day before, been chopping wood, and loaded my cart pretty heavily, thinking in this way to tame my oxen.
<p/>There I was, entirely alone, in a thick wood, in a place new to me. I then proceeded on my way home.
<p/>I had now consumed one half of the day. I got out of the woods safely, and now felt out of danger.
<p/>I stopped my oxen to open the woods gate; and just as I did so, before I could get hold of my ox-rope, the oxen again started, rushed through the gate, catching it between the wheel and the body of the cart, tearing it to pieces, and coming within a few inches of crushing me against the gate-post.
<p/>Thus twice, in one short day, I escaped death by the merest chance. On my return, I told Mr. Covey what had happened, and how it happened.
<p/>Just as I got into the woods, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) came up and told me to stop my cart, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would teach me how to trifle away my time, and break gates.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) then went to a large gum-tree, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) axe cut three large switches, and, after trimming them up neatly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) pocketknife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) ordered me to take off my clothes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) ordered me to return to the woods again immediately. I did so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) followed on after me. I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) no answer, but stood with my clothes on.
<p/>Upon this he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore off my clothes, and lashed me till he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) had worn out his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) switches, cutting me so savagely as to leave the marks visible for a long time after.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) order. I still made him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) no answer, nor did I move to strip myself. This whipping was the first of a number just like it, and for similar offences.
<p/>I lived with Mr. Covey one year. During the first six months, of that year, scarce a week passed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) whipping me.
<p/>I was seldom free from a sore back. My awkwardness was almost always his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) excuse for whipping me. We were worked fully up to the point of endurance.
<p/>Long before day we were up, our horses fed, and by the first approach of day we were off to the field with our hoes and ploughing teams.
<p/>Mr. Covey gave us enough to eat, but scarce time to eat it. We were often less than five minutes taking our meals.
<p/>We were often in the field from the first approach of day till its last lingering ray had left us; and at saving-fodder time, midnight often caught us in the field binding blades.
<p/>Covey would be out with us. The way he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) used to stand it, was this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would spend the most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) afternoons in bed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would then come out fresh in the evening, ready to urge us on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) words, example, and frequently with the whip.
<p/>Mr. Covey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was a hard-working man.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) work went on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) absence almost as well as in his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) presence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) had the faculty of making us feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was ever present with us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) knew by himself just what a man or a boy could do. There was no deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). This he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did by surprising us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seldom approached the spot where we were at work openly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do it secretly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always aimed at taking us by surprise.
<p/>When we were at work in the cornfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would sometimes crawl on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and knees to avoid detection, and all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would rise nearly in our midst, and scream out, ``Ha, ha!
<p/>Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cunning, that we used to call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), among ourselves, <div class="bookquote">``the snake. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Come, come! Dash on, dash on!''
<p/>This being his (<font color='blue'><b>Dash</b></font>) mode of attack, it was never safe to stop a single minute. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dash</b></font>) comings were like a thief in the night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dash</b></font>) appeared to us as being ever at hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dash</b></font>) was under every tree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every window, on the plantation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dash</b></font>) would sometimes mount his (<font color='blue'><b>Dash</b></font>) horse, as if bound to St. Michael's, a distance of seven miles, and in half an hour afterwards you would see him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence, watching every motion of the slaves.
<p/>Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would sometimes walk up to us, and give us orders as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was upon the point of starting on a long journey, turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) back upon us, and make as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) was going to the house to get ready; and, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would get half way thither, he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would turn short and crawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and there watch us till the going down of the sun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) would, for this purpose, leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) horse tied up in the woods. Mr. Covey's forte consisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) power to deceive.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) life was devoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions. Every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) possessed in the shape of learning or religion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) made conform to his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) disposition to deceive.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would make a short prayer in the morning, and a long prayer at night; and, strange as it may seem, few men would at times appear more devotional than he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>).
<p/>The exercises of his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) family devotions were always commenced with singing; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was a very poor singer himself, the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the Almighty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) would read his (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) hymn, and nod at me to commence.
<p/>I would at times do so; at others, I would not. My non-compliance would almost always produce much confusion. To show himself independent of me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) would start and stagger through with his (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) hymn in the most discordant manner.
<p/>such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) disposition, and success at deceiving, I do verily believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) was a sincere worshipper of the most high God; and this, too, at a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may be said to have been guilty of compelling his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) woman slave to commit the sin of adultery.
<p/>The facts in the case are these: Mr. Covey was a poor man; he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was just commencing in life; he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was only able to buy one slave; and, shocking as is the fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) bought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) said, for a breeder .
<p/>In this state of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) prayed with more than ordinary spirit. Poor man! This woman was named Caroline. Mr. Covey bought her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) from Mr. Thomas Lowe, about six miles from St. Michael's.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) was a large, able-bodied woman, about twenty years old. She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) had already given birth to one child, which proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) to be just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) wanted.
<p/>After buying her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) hired a married man of Mr. Samuel Harrison, to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) one year; and him (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) used to fasten up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) every night!
<p/>The result was, that, at the end of the year, the miserable woman gave birth to twins. At this result Mr. Covey seemed to be highly pleased, both with the man and the wretched woman.
<p/>Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) joy, and that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) wife, that nothing they could do for Caroline during her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) confinement was too good, or too hard, to be done.
<p/>If at any one time of my life more than another, I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr. Covey.
<p/>It was never too hot or too cold; it could never rain, blow, hail, or snow, too hard for us to work in the field.
<p/>The children were regarded as being quite an addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) wealth. We were worked in all weathers. Work, work, work, was scarcely more the order of the day than of the night.
<p/>The longest days were too short for him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>), and the shortest nights too long for him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>). I was somewhat unmanageable when I first went there, but a few months of this discipline tamed me.
<p/>My natural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute!
<p/>Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken in body, soul, and spirit. Sunday was my only leisure time. I spent this in a sort of beast-like stupor, between sleep and wake, under some large tree.
<p/>At times I would rise up, a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul, accompanied with a faint beam of hope, that flickered for a moment, and then vanished.
<p/>I was sometimes prompted to take my life, and that of Covey, but was prevented by a combination of hope and fear.
<p/>I sank down again, mourning over my wretched condition. My sufferings on this plantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality.
<p/>Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay, whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe.
<p/>Those beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to the eye of freemen, were to me so many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my wretched condition.
<p/>I have often, in the deep stillness of a summer's Sabbath, stood all alone upon the lofty banks of that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful eye, the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean.
<p/>My thoughts would compel utterance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour out my soul's complaint, in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of ships:-- <div class="bookquote">``You are loosed from your moorings, and are free; I am fast in my chains, and am a slave!
<p/>The sight of these always affected me powerfully. You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I sadly before the bloody whip!
<p/>You are freedom's swift-winged angels, that fly round the world; I am confined in bands of iron! O that I were free!
<p/>O, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting wing! Alas! betwixt me and you, the turbid waters roll.
<p/>Go on, go on. O that I could also go! Could I but swim! If I could fly! O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute!
<p/>The glad ship is gone; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hides in the dim distance. I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery.
<p/>O God, save me! God, deliver me! Let me be free! Is there any God? Why am I a slave? I will run away.
<p/>I will not stand it. Get caught, or get clear, I'll try it. I had as well die with ague as the fever.
<p/>I have only one life to lose. I had as well be killed running as die standing. Only think of it; one hundred miles straight north, and I am free!
<p/>Try it? Yes! God helping me, I will. It cannot be that I shall live and die a slave. I will take to the water.
<p/>I will do the same; and when I get to the head of the bay, I will turn my canoe adrift, and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania.
<p/>This very bay shall yet bear me into freedom. The steamboats steered in a north-east course from North Point. When I get there, I shall not be required to have a pass; I can travel without being disturbed.
<p/>Let but the first opportunity offer, and, come what will, I am off. Meanwhile, I will try to bear up under the yoke.
<p/>I am not the only slave in the world. Why should I fret? I can bear as much as any of them.
<p/>Besides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound to some one. It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free.
<p/>Thus I used to think, and thus I used to speak to myself; goaded almost to madness at one moment, and at the next reconciling myself to my wretched lot.
<p/>I have already intimated that my condition was much worse, during the first six months of my stay at Mr. Covey's, than in the last six.
<p/>There is a better day coming. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the multitude</b></font>)</div>The circumstances leading to the change in Mr. Covey's course toward me form an epoch in my humble history.
<p/>On one of the hottest days of the month of August, 1833, Bill Smith, William Hughes, a slave named Eli, and myself, were engaged in fanning wheat.
<p/>You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man. Hughes was clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan.
<p/>The work was simple, requiring strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused to such work, it came very hard.
<p/>About three o'clock of that day, I broke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violent aching of the head, attended with extreme dizziness; I trembled in every limb.
<p/>Eli was turning, Smith was feeding, and I was carrying wheat to the fan. Finding what was coming, I nerved myself up, feeling it would never do to stop work.
<p/>I stood as long as I could stagger to the hopper with grain. When I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as if held down by an immense weight.
<p/>The fan of course stopped; every one had his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) own work to do; and no one could do the work of the other, and have his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) own go on at the same time.
<p/>Mr. Covey was at the house, about one hundred yards from the treading-yard where we were fanning. On hearing the fan stop, he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) left immediately, and came to the spot where we were.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) hastily inquired what the matter was. Bill answered that I was sick, and there was no one to bring wheat to the fan.
<p/>I had by this time crawled away under the side of the post and rail-fence by which the yard was enclosed, hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) then asked where I was. He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) was told by one of the hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) came to the spot, and, after looking at me awhile, asked me what was the matter.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) as well as I could, for I scarce had strength to speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) then gave me a savage kick in the side, and told me to get up.
<p/>I tried to do so, but fell back in the attempt. He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) gave me another kick, and again told me to rise.
<p/>I again tried, and succeeded in gaining my feet; but, stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding the fan, I again staggered and fell.
<p/>While down in this situation, Mr. Covey took up the hickory slat with which Hughes had been striking off the half-bushel measure, and with it gave me a heavy blow upon the head, making a large wound, and the blood ran freely; and with this again told me to get up.
<p/>I made no effort to comply, having now made up my mind to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) do his (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) worst. In a short time after receiving this blow, my head grew better.
<p/>At this moment I resolved, for the first time, to go to my master, enter a complaint, and ask his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) protection.
<p/>In order to do this, I must that afternoon walk seven miles; and this, under the circumstances, was truly a severe undertaking.
<p/>I was exceedingly feeble; made so as much by the kicks and blows which I received, as by the severe fit of sickness to which I had been subjected.
<p/>Mr. Covey had now left me to my fate. I, however, watched my chance, while Covey was looking in an opposite direction, and started for St. Michael's.
<p/>I succeeded in getting a considerable distance on my way to the woods, when Covey discovered me, and called after me to come back, threatening what he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would do if I did not come.
<p/>I disregarded both his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) calls and his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) threats, and made my way to the woods as fast as my feeble state would allow; and thinking I might be overhauled by him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) if I kept the road, I walked through the woods, keeping far enough from the road to avoid detection, and near enough to prevent losing my way.
<p/>I had not gone far before my little strength again failed me. I could go no farther. I fell down, and lay for a considerable time.
<p/>For a time I thought I should bleed to death; and think now that I should have done so, but that the blood so matted my hair as to stop the wound.
<p/>After lying there about three quarters of an hour, I nerved myself up again, and started on my way, through bogs and briers, barefooted and bareheaded, tearing my feet sometimes at nearly every step; and after a journey of about seven miles, occupying some five hours to perform it, I arrived at master's store.
<p/>The blood was yet oozing from the wound on my head. I then presented an appearance enough to affect any but a heart of iron.
<p/>From the crown of my head to my feet, I was covered with blood. My hair was all clotted with dust and blood; my shirt was stiff with blood.
<p/>I suppose I looked like a man who had escaped a den of wild beasts, and barely escaped them. In this state I appeared before my master, humbly entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to interpose his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) authority for my protection.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) all the circumstances as well as I could, and it seemed, as I spoke, at times to affect him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would then walk the floor, and seek to justify Covey by saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) expected I deserved it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) asked me what I wanted.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>), to let me get a new home; that as sure as I lived with Mr. Covey again, I should live with but to die with him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>); that Covey would surely kill me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was in a fair way for it.
<p/>Master Thomas ridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr. Covey's killing me, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) knew Mr. Covey; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was a good man, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) could not think of taking me from him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>); that, should he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) do so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would lose the whole year's wages; that I belonged to Mr. Covey for one year, and that I must go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>), come what might; and that I must not trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) with any more stories, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would himself get hold of me .
<p/>After threatening me thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) gave me a very large dose of salts, telling me that I might remain in St. Michael's that night, -LRB-it being quite late,-RRB- but that I must be off back to Mr. Covey's early in the morning; and that if I did not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would get hold of me, which meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would whip me.
<p/>I remained all night, and, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) orders, I started off to Covey's in the morning, -LRB-Saturday morning,-RRB- wearied in body and broken in spirit.
<p/>I reached Covey's about nine o'clock; and just as I was getting over the fence that divided Mrs. Kemp's fields from ours, out ran Covey with his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) cowskin, to give me another whipping.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) could reach me, I succeeded in getting to the cornfield; and as the corn was very high, it afforded me the means of hiding.
<p/>I got no supper that night, or breakfast that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) seemed very angry, and searched for me a long time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) finally gave up the chase, thinking, I suppose, that I must come home for something to eat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would give himself no further trouble in looking for me.
<p/>I spent that day mostly in the woods, having the alternative before me,--to go home and be whipped to death, or stay in the woods and be starved to death.
<p/>My behavior was altogether unaccountable. That night, I fell in with Sandy Jenkins, a slave with whom I was somewhat acquainted.
<p/>Sandy had a free wife who lived about four miles from Mr. Covey's; and it being Saturday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) way to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sandy</b></font>).
<p/>I went home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>), and talked this whole matter over, and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) advice as to what course it was best for me to pursue.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) my circumstances, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) very kindly invited me to go home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>). I found Sandy an old adviser.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) told me, with great solemnity, I must go back to Covey; but that before I went, I must go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) into another part of the woods, where there was a certain root, which, if I would take some of it with me, carrying it always on my right side, would render it impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white man, to whip me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) had carried it for years; and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) had done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) had never received a blow, and never expected to while he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) carried it.
<p/>I at first rejected the idea, that the simple carrying of a root in my pocket would have any such effect as he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) had said, and was not disposed to take it; but Sandy impressed the necessity with much earnestness, telling me it could do no harm, if it did no good.
<p/>To please him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>), I at length took the root, and, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) direction, carried it upon my right side. This was Sunday morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) spoke to me very kindly, bade me drive the pigs from a lot near by, and passed on towards the church.
<p/>Now, this singular conduct of Mr. Covey really made me begin to think that there was something in the root which Sandy had given me; and had it been on any other day than Sunday, I could have attributed the conduct to no other cause than the influence of that root; and as it was, I was half inclined to think the root to be something more than I at first had taken it to be.
<p/>I immediately started for home; and upon entering the yard gate, out came Mr. Covey on his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) way to meeting. All went well till Monday morning.
<p/>On this morning, the virtue of the root was fully tested. Long before daylight, I was called to go and rub, curry, and feed, the horses.
<p/>But whilst thus engaged, whilst in the act of throwing down some blades from the loft, Mr. Covey entered the stable with a long rope; and just as I was half out of the loft, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) caught hold of my legs, and was about tying me.
<p/>As soon as I found what he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was up to, I gave a sudden spring, and as I did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) holding to my legs, I was brought sprawling on the stable floor.
<p/>Mr. Covey seemed now to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) had me, and could do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) pleased; but at this moment--from whence came the spirit I don't know--I resolved to fight; and, suiting my action to the resolution, I seized Covey hard by the throat; and as I did so, I rose.
<p/>I obeyed, and was glad to obey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) held on to me, and I to him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>). My resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey seemed taken all aback.
<p/>This gave me assurance, and I held him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) uneasy, causing the blood to run where I touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) with the ends of my fingers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) trembled like a leaf. Mr. Covey soon called out to Hughes for help. Hughes came, and, while Covey held me, attempted to tie my right hand.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was in the act of doing so, I watched my chance, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) a heavy kick close under the ribs.
<p/>This kick fairly sickened Hughes, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) left me in the hands of Mr. Covey. This kick had the effect of not only weakening Hughes, but Covey also.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) saw Hughes bending over with pain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) courage quailed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) asked me if I meant to persist in my resistance.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) I did, come what might; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) had used me like a brute for six months, and that I was determined to be used so no longer.
<p/>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) strove to drag me to a stick that was lying just out of the stable door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) meant to knock me down.
<p/>But just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) was leaning over to get the stick, I seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) with both hands by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) collar, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) by a sudden snatch to the ground.
<p/>By this time, Bill came. Covey called upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) for assistance. Bill wanted to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) could do. Covey said, <div class="bookquote">``Take hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>), take hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Covey/Covey/Mr. Edward Covey</b></font>)</div><p/>Bill said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) master hired him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) out to work, and not to help to whip me; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) left Covey and myself to fight our own battle out.
<p/>Covey at length let me go, puffing and blowing at a great rate, saying that if I had not resisted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would not have whipped me half so much.
<p/>I considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) as getting entirely the worst end of the bargain; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) had drawn no blood from me, but I had from him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>).
<p/>The whole six months afterwards, that I spent with Mr. Covey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) never laid the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) finger upon me in anger.
<p/>We were at it for nearly two hours. The truth was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) had not whipped me at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would occasionally say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) didn't want to get hold of me again.
<p/>'' No,'' thought I, <div class="bookquote">``you need not; for you will come off worse than you did before. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>This battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a slave.
<p/>It rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived within me a sense of my own manhood. It recalled the departed self-confidence, and inspired me again with a determination to be free.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) only can understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has himself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery.
<p/>The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow, even death itself. I felt as I never felt before.
<p/>My long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance took its place; and I now resolved that, however long I might remain a slave in form, the day had passed forever when I could be a slave in fact.
<p/>I did not hesitate to let it be known of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, must also succeed in killing me.
<p/>From this time I was never again what might be called fairly whipped, though I remained a slave four years afterwards.
<p/>It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom. I had several fights, but was never whipped.
<p/>It was for a long time a matter of surprise to me why Mr. Covey did not immediately have me taken by the constable to the whipping-post, and there regularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand against a white man in defence of myself.
<p/>And the only explanation I can now think of does not entirely satisfy me; but such as it is, I will give it.
<p/>Mr. Covey enjoyed the most unbounded reputation for being a first-rate overseer and negro-breaker. It was of considerable importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>).
<p/>That reputation was at stake; and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) sent me--a boy about sixteen years old--to the public whipping-post, his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) reputation would have been lost; so, to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) reputation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) suffered me to go unpunished.
<p/>The days between Christmas and New Year's day are allowed as holidays; and, accordingly, we were not required to perform any labor, more than to feed and take care of the stock.
<p/>This time we regarded as our own, by the grace of our masters; and we therefore used or abused it nearly as we pleased.
<p/>Those of us who had families at a distance, were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society.
<p/>My term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas day, 1833. This time, however, was spent in various ways.
<p/>The staid, sober, thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn-brooms, mats, horse-collars, and baskets; and another class of us would spend the time in hunting opossums, hares, and coons.
<p/>But by far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball, wrestling, running foot-races, fiddling, dancing, and drinking whisky; and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters.
<p/>A slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them. He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master.
<p/>It was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas; and he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was regarded as lazy indeed, who had not provided himself with the necessary means, during the year, to get whisky enough to last him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) through Christmas.
<p/>From what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave, I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection.
<p/>Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice, I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves.
<p/>But for these, the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation; and woe betide the slaveholder, the day he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors!
<p/>I warn him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) that, in such an event, a spirit will go forth in their midst, more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake.
<p/>These holidays serve as conductors, or safety-valves, to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity. The holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong, and inhumanity of slavery.
<p/>They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the result of selfishness, and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the down-trodden slave.
<p/>They do not give the slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during its continuance, but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it.
<p/>This will be seen by the fact, that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their ending as of their beginning.
<p/>For instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) drunk.
<p/>One plan is, to make bets on their slaves, as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk; and in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess.
<p/>Thus, when the slave asks for virtuous freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) ignorance, cheats him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labelled with the name of liberty.
<p/>The most of us used to drink it down, and the result was just what might be supposed; many of us were led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery.
<p/>Their object seems to be, to disgust their slaves with freedom, by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation. We felt, and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum.
<p/>So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field,--feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.
<p/>I have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of fraud and inhumanity of slavery.
<p/>The mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom, by allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) to see only the abuse of it, is carried out in other things.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master, in many cases, goes off to town, and buys a large quantity; he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) returns, takes his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) whip, and commands the slave to eat the molasses, until the poor fellow is made sick at the very mention of it.
<p/>It is so. For instance, a slave loves molasses; he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) steals some. The same mode is sometimes adopted to make the slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master is enraged at him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>); but, not willing to send him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) off without food, gives him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) more than is necessary, and compels him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) to eat it within a given time.
<p/>Then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) complains that he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) cannot eat it, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting, and is whipped for being hard to please!
<p/>I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same principle, drawn from my own observation, but think the cases I have cited sufficient.
<p/>On the first of January, 1834, I left Mr. Covey, and went to live with Mr. William Freeland, who lived about three miles from St. Michael's.
<p/>A slave runs through his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) allowance, and applies for more. The practice is a very common one. I soon found Mr. Freeland a very different man from Mr. Covey.
<p/>Though not rich, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was what would be called an educated southern gentleman. Mr. Covey, as I have shown, was a well-trained negro-breaker and slave-driver.
<p/>The former -LRB-slaveholder though he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was-RRB- seemed to possess some regard for honor, some reverence for justice, and some respect for humanity.
<p/>Mr. Freeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders, such as being very passionate and fretful; but I must do him (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) the justice to say, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which Mr. Covey was constantly addicted.
<p/>The latter seemed totally insensible to all such sentiments. The one was open and frank, and we always knew where to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>).
<p/>The other was a most artful deceiver, and could be understood only by such as were skilful enough to detect his (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) cunningly-devised frauds.
<p/>Another advantage I gained in my new master was, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) made no pretensions to, or profession of, religion; and this, in my opinion, was truly a great advantage.
<p/>I assert most unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes,--a justifier of the most appalling barbarity,--a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds,--and
<p/>Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, next to that enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me.
<p/>a dark shelter under, which the darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection. For of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst.
<p/>It was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder, but to live in a community of such religionists.
<p/>I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others. Very near Mr. Freeland lived the Rev. Daniel Weeden, and in the same neighborhood lived the Rev. Rigby Hopkins.
<p/>These were members and ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church. Mr. Weeden owned, among others, a woman slave, whose name I have forgotten.
<p/>This woman's back, for weeks, was kept literally raw, made so by the lash of this merciless, religious wretch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weeden</b></font>) used to hire hands.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weeden</b></font>) maxim was, Behave well or behave ill, it is the duty of a master occasionally to whip a slave, to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master's authority.
<p/>Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) theory, and such his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) practice. Mr. Hopkins was even worse than Mr. Weeden. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weeden</b></font>) chief boast was his (<font color='blue'><b>Weeden</b></font>) ability to manage slaves.
<p/>The peculiar feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weeden</b></font>) government was that of whipping slaves in advance of deserving it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weeden</b></font>) always managed to have one or more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weeden</b></font>) slaves to whip every Monday morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weeden</b></font>) did this to alarm their fears, and strike terror into those who escaped. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weeden</b></font>) plan was to whip for the smallest offences, to prevent the commission of large ones.
<p/>It would astonish one, unaccustomed to a slaveholding life, to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can find things, of which to make occasion to whip a slave.
<p/>A mere look, word, or motion,--a mistake, accident, or want of power,--are all matters for which a slave may be whipped at any time.
<p/>Mr. Hopkins could always find some excuse for whipping a slave. Does a slave look dissatisfied? It is said, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) has the devil in him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), and it must be whipped out.
<p/>Does he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) speak loudly when spoken to by his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is getting high-minded, and should be taken down a button-hole lower.
<p/>Does he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) forget to pull off his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) hat at the approach of a white person? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is wanting in reverence, and should be whipped for it.
<p/>Does he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) ever venture to vindicate his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) conduct, when censured for it? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is guilty of impudence,--one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty.
<p/>Does he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) ever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from that pointed out by his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master? He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is indeed presumptuous, and getting above himself; and nothing less than a flogging will do for him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>).
<p/>Does he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), while ploughing, break a plough,--or, while hoeing, break a hoe? It is owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) carelessness, and for it a slave must always be whipped.
<p/>Mr. Hopkins could always find something of this sort to justify the use of the lash, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>) seldom failed to embrace such opportunities.
<p/>There was not a man in the whole county, with whom the slaves who had the getting their own home, would not prefer to live, rather than with this Rev. Mr. Hopkins.
<p/>And yet there was not a man any where round, who made higher professions of religion, or was more active in revivals,--more attentive to the class, love-feast, prayer and preaching meetings, or more devotional in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family,--that prayed earlier, later, louder, and longer,--than this same reverend slave-driver, Rigby Hopkins.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>), like Mr. Covey, gave us enough to eat; but, unlike Mr. Covey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) also gave us sufficient time to take our meals.
<p/>But to return to Mr. Freeland, and to my experience while in his (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) employment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) worked us hard, but always between sunrise and sunset.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) farm was large, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) employed hands enough to work it, and with ease, compared with many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) neighbors.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) required a good deal of work to be done, but gave us good tools with which to work. My treatment, while in his (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) employment, was heavenly, compared with what I experienced at the hands of Mr. Edward Covey.
<p/>Mr. Freeland was himself the owner of but two slaves. Their names were Henry Harris and John Harris. The rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) hired.
<p/>These consisted of myself, Sandy Jenkins,* and Handy Caldwell. * This is the same man who gave me the roots to prevent my being whipped by Mr. Covey.
<p/>We used frequently to talk about the fight with Covey, and as often as we did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) would claim my success as the result of the roots which he (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) gave me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Covey</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``a clever soul. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>This superstition is very common among the more ignorant slaves. A slave seldom dies but that his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) death is attributed to trickery.
<p/>Henry and John were quite intelligent, and in a very little while after I went there, I succeeded in creating in them a strong desire to learn how to read.
<p/>This desire soon sprang up in the others also. They very soon mustered up some old spelling-books, and nothing would do but that I must keep a Sabbath school.
<p/>I agreed to do so, and accordingly devoted my Sundays to teaching these my loved fellow-slaves how to read. Neither of them knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) letters when I went there.
<p/>Some of the slaves of the neighboring farms found what was going on, and also availed themselves of this little opportunity to learn to read.
<p/>It was necessary to keep our religious masters at St. Michael's unacquainted with the fact, that, instead of spending the Sabbath in wrestling, boxing, and drinking whisky, we were trying to learn how to read the will of God; for they had much rather see us engaged in those degrading sports, than to see us behaving like intellectual, moral, and accountable beings.
<p/>My blood boils as I think of the bloody manner in which Messrs. Wright Fairbanks and Garrison West, both class-leaders, in connection with many others, rushed in upon us with sticks and stones, and broke up our virtuous little Sabbath school, at St. Michael's--
<p/>It was understood, among all who came, that there must be as little display about it as possible. all calling themselves Christians!
<p/>I held my Sabbath school at the house of a free colored man, whose name I deem it imprudent to mention; for should it be known, it might embarrass him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) greatly, though the crime of holding the school was committed ten years ago.
<p/>humble followers of the Lord Jesus Christ! But I am again digressing. I had at one time over forty scholars, and those of the right sort, ardently desiring to learn.
<p/>They were of all ages, though mostly men and women. I look back to those Sundays with an amount of pleasure not to be expressed.
<p/>They were great days to my soul. The work of instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetest engagement with which I was ever blessed.
<p/>When I think that these precious souls are to-day shut up in the prison-house of slavery, my feelings overcome me, and I am almost ready to ask, <div class="bookquote">``Does a righteous God govern the universe?
<p/>and for what does he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hold the thunders in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) right hand, if not to smite the oppressor, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler?
<p/>These dear souls came not to Sabbath school because it was popular to do so, nor did I teach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged.
<p/>We loved each other, and to leave them at the close of the Sabbath was a severe cross indeed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Every moment they spent in that school, they were liable to be taken up, and given thirty-nine lashes.
<p/>They came because they wished to learn. Their minds had been starved by their cruel masters. They had been shut up in mental darkness.
<p/>I taught them, because it was the delight of my soul to be doing something that looked like bettering the condition of my race.
<p/>I kept up my school nearly the whole year I lived with Mr. Freeland; and, beside my Sabbath school, I devoted three evenings in the week, during the winter, to teaching the slaves at home.
<p/>And I have the happiness to know, that several of those who came to Sabbath school learned how to read; and that one, at least, is now free through my agency.
<p/>The year passed off smoothly. It seemed only about half as long as the year which preceded it. I went through it without receiving a single blow.
<p/>I will give Mr. Freeland the credit of being the best master I ever had, till I became my own master.
<p/>For the ease with which I passed the year, I was, however, somewhat indebted to the society of my fellow-slaves. They were noble souls; they not only possessed loving hearts, but brave ones.
<p/>We were linked and interlinked with each other. I loved them with a love stronger than any thing I have experienced since.
<p/>In answer to this assertion, I can say, I never loved any or confided in any people more than my fellow-slaves, and especially those with whom I lived at Mr. Freeland's.
<p/>It is sometimes said that we slaves do not love and confide in each other. I believe we would have died for each other.
<p/>We were one; and as much so by our tempers and dispositions, as by the mutual hardships to which we were necessarily subjected by our condition as slaves.
<p/>We never undertook to do any thing, of any importance, without a mutual consultation. We never moved separately. At the close of the year 1834, Mr. Freeland again hired me of my master, for the year 1835.
<p/>But, by this time, I began to want to live upon free land as well as with Freeland; and I was no longer content, therefore, to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) or any other slaveholder.
<p/>I began, with the commencement of the year, to prepare myself for a final struggle, which should decide my fate one way or the other.
<p/>My tendency was upward. I was fast approaching manhood, and year after year had passed, and I was still a slave.
<p/>These thoughts roused me--I must do something. I therefore resolved that 1835 should not pass without witnessing an attempt, on my part, to secure my liberty.
<p/>But I was not willing to cherish this determination alone. My fellow-slaves were dear to me. I was anxious to have them participate with me in this, my life-giving determination.
<p/>I therefore, though with great prudence, commenced early to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition, and to imbue their minds with thoughts of freedom.
<p/>I bent myself to devising ways and means for our escape, and meanwhile strove, on all fitting occasions, to impress them with the gross fraud and inhumanity of slavery.
<p/>I went first to Henry, next to John, then to the others. I found, in them all, warm hearts and noble spirits.
<p/>They were ready to hear, and ready to act when a feasible plan should be proposed. This was what I wanted.
<p/>I talked to them of our want of manhood, if we submitted to our enslavement without at least one noble effort to be free.
<p/>We met often, and consulted frequently, and told our hopes and fears, recounted the difficulties, real and imagined, which we should be called on to meet.
<p/>At times we were almost disposed to give up, and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot; at others, we were firm and unbending in our determination to go.
<p/>Our path was beset with the greatest obstacles; and if we succeeded in gaining the end of it, our right to be free was yet questionable--we were yet liable to be returned to bondage.
<p/>Whenever we suggested any plan, there was shrinking--the odds were fearful. We could see no spot, this side of the ocean, where we could be free.
<p/>Our knowledge of the north did not extend farther than New York; and to go there, and be forever harassed with the frightful liability of being returned to slavery--with the certainty of being treated tenfold worse than before--the thought was truly a horrible one, and one which it was not easy to overcome.
<p/>The case sometimes stood thus: At every gate through which we were to pass, we saw a watchman--at every ferry a guard--on every bridge a sentinel--and in every wood a patrol.
<p/>We knew nothing about Canada. We were hemmed in upon every side. Here were the difficulties, real or imagined--the good to be sought, and the evil to be shunned.
<p/>On the one hand, there stood slavery, a stern reality, glaring frightfully upon us,--its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions, and even now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh.
<p/>On the other hand, away back in the dim distance, under the flickering light of the north star, behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain, stood a doubtful freedom--half frozen--beckoning us to come and share its hospitality.
<p/>This in itself was sometimes enough to stagger us; but when we permitted ourselves to survey the road, we were frequently appalled.
<p/>Upon either side we saw grim death, assuming the most horrid shapes. Now it was starvation, causing us to eat our own flesh;--now
<p/>we were contending with the waves, and were drowned;--now we were overtaken, and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound.
<p/>We were stung by scorpions, chased by wild beasts, bitten by snakes, and finally, after having nearly reached the desired spot,--after swimming rivers, encountering wild beasts, sleeping in the woods, suffering hunger and nakedness,--we were overtaken by our pursuers, and, in our resistance, we were shot dead upon the spot!
<p/>I say, this picture sometimes appalled us, and made us <div class="bookquote">``rather bear those ills we had, Than fly to others, that we knew not of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In coming to a fixed determination to run away, we did more than Patrick Henry, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) resolved upon liberty or death.
<p/>With us it was a doubtful liberty at most, and almost certain death if we failed. For my part, I should prefer death to hopeless bondage.
<p/>Sandy, one of our number, gave up the notion, but still encouraged us. Our company then consisted of Henry Harris, John Harris, Henry Bailey, Charles Roberts, and myself.
<p/>Henry Bailey was my uncle, and belonged to my master. Charles married my aunt: he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) belonged to my master's father-in-law, Mr. William Hamilton.
<p/>The plan we finally concluded upon was, to get a large canoe belonging to Mr. Hamilton, and upon the Saturday night previous to Easter holidays, paddle directly up the Chesapeake Bay.
<p/>On our arrival at the head of the bay, a distance of seventy or eighty miles from where we lived, it was our purpose to turn our canoe adrift, and follow the guidance of the north star till we got beyond the limits of Maryland.
<p/>Our reason for taking the water route was, that we were less liable to be suspected as runaways; we hoped to be regarded as fishermen; whereas, if we should take the land route, we should be subjected to interruptions of almost every kind.
<p/>Any one having a white face, and being so disposed, could stop us, and subject us to examination. The week before our intended start, I wrote several protections, one for each of us.
<p/>This is to certify that I, the undersigned, have given the bearer, my servant, full liberty to go to Baltimore, and spend the Easter holidays.
<p/>As well as I can remember, they were in the following words, to wit:-- '' Written with mine own hand, &c., 1835.
<p/>We were not going to Baltimore; but, in going up the bay, we went toward Baltimore, and these protections were only intended to protect us while on the bay.
<p/>'' WILLIAM HAMILTON, <div class="bookquote">``Near St. Michael's, in Talbot county, Maryland. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hamilton/Mr. William Hamilton/William</b></font>)</div>As the time drew near for our departure, our anxiety became more and more intense.
<p/>It was truly a matter of life and death with us. The strength of our determination was about to be fully tested.
<p/>At this time, I was very active in explaining every difficulty, removing every doubt, dispelling every fear, and inspiring all with the firmness indispensable to success in our undertaking; assuring them that half was gained the instant we made the move; we had talked long enough; we were now ready to move; if not now, we never should be; and if we did not intend to move now, we had as well fold our arms, sit down, and acknowledge ourselves fit only to be slaves.
<p/>Every man stood firm; and at our last meeting, we pledged ourselves afresh, in the most solemn manner, that, at the time appointed, we would certainly start in pursuit of freedom.
<p/>This, none of us were prepared to acknowledge. This was in the middle of the week, at the end of which we were to be off.
<p/>We went, as usual, to our several fields of labor, but with bosoms highly agitated with thoughts of our truly hazardous undertaking.
<p/>We tried to conceal our feelings as much as possible; and I think we succeeded very well. After a painful waiting, the Saturday morning, whose night was to witness our departure, came.
<p/>I probably felt more anxious than the rest, because I was, by common consent, at the head of the whole affair.
<p/>I hailed it with joy, bring what of sadness it might. Friday night was a sleepless one for me. The responsibility of success or failure lay heavily upon me.
<p/>The glory of the one, and the confusion of the other, were alike mine. The first two hours of that morning were such as I never experienced before, and hope never to again.
<p/>We were spreading manure; and all at once, while thus engaged, I was overwhelmed with an indescribable feeling, in the fulness of which I turned to Sandy, who was near by, and said, <div class="bookquote">``We are betrayed!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sandy/Sandy Jenkins</b></font>)</div><p/>Early in the morning, we went, as usual, to the field. '' Well,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sandy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that thought has this moment struck me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We said no more. I was never more certain of any thing. The horn was blown as usual, and we went up from the field to the house for breakfast.
<p/>Just as I got to the house, in looking out at the lane gate, I saw four white men, with two colored men.
<p/>I went for the form, more than for want of any thing to eat that morning. The white men were on horseback, and the colored ones were walking behind, as if tied.
<p/>I watched them a few moments till they got up to our lane gate. Here they halted, and tied the colored men to the gate-post.
<p/>I was not yet certain as to what the matter was. In a few moments, in rode Mr. Hamilton, with a speed betokening great excitement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) came to the door, and inquired if Master William was in. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was told he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was at the barn. Mr. Hamilton, without dismounting, rode up to the barn with extraordinary speed.
<p/>By this time, the three constables rode up, and in great haste dismounted, tied their horses, and met Master William and Mr. Hamilton returning from the barn; and after talking awhile, they all walked up to the kitchen door.
<p/>In a few moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and Mr. Freeland returned to the house. There was no one in the kitchen but myself and John.
<p/>Mr. Freeland put his (<font color='blue'><b>Freeland</b></font>) head in at the door, and called me by name, saying, there were some gentlemen at the door who wished to see me.
<p/>Henry and Sandy were up at the barn. I stepped to the door, and inquired what they wanted. They at once seized me, and, without giving me any satisfaction, tied me--lashing my hands closely together.
<p/>They at length said, that they had learned I had been in a <div class="bookquote">``scrape,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and that I was to be examined before my master; and if their information proved false, I should not be hurt.
<p/>I insisted upon knowing what the matter was. In a few moments, they succeeded in tying John. They then turned to Henry, who had by this time returned, and commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to cross his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' I won't!'' said Henry, in a firm tone, indicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) readiness to meet the consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) refusal. '' Won't you?'' said Tom Graham, the constable.
<p/>With this, two of the constables pulled out their shining pistols, and swore, by their Creator, that they would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) cross his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) hands or kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>).
<p/>Each cocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) pistol, and, with fingers on the trigger, walked up to Henry, saying, at the same time, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did not cross his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hands, they would blow his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) damned heart out.
<p/>'' No, I won't!'' said Henry, in a still stronger tone. '' Shoot me, shoot me!'' said Henry; <div class="bookquote">``you can't kill me but once.
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said in a tone of loud defiance; and at the same time, with a motion as quick as lightning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with one single stroke dashed the pistols from the hand of each constable.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) did this, all hands fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>), and, after beating him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) some time, they finally overpowered him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>), and got him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) tied.
<p/>During the scuffle, I managed, I know not how, to get my pass out, and, without being discovered, put it into the fire.
<p/>We were all now tied; and just as we were to leave for Easton jail, Betsy Freeland, mother of William Freeland, came to the door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) hands full of biscuits, and divided them between Henry and John.
<p/>Shoot, shoot,--and be damned! I won't be tied! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Patrick Henry</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) then delivered herself of a speech, to the following effect:--addressing herself to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) said, '' You devil!
<p/>You yellow devil! it was you that put it into the heads of Henry and John to run away. But for you, you long-legged mulatto devil!
<p/>Henry nor John would never have thought of such a thing. '' I made no reply, and was immediately hurried off towards St. Michael's.
<p/>Just a moment previous to the scuffle with Henry, Mr. Hamilton suggested the propriety of making a search for the protections which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had understood Frederick had written for himself and the rest.
<p/>But, just at the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) was about carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) proposal into effect, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) aid was needed in helping to tie Henry; and the excitement attending the scuffle caused them either to forget, or to deem it unsafe, under the circumstances, to search.
<p/>When we got about half way to St. Michael's, while the constables having us in charge were looking ahead, Henry inquired of me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pass.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to eat it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) biscuit, and own nothing; and we passed the word around, '' Own nothing; '' and '' Own nothing!
<p/>So we were not yet convicted of the intention to run away. '' said we all. Our confidence in each other was unshaken.
<p/>We were resolved to succeed or fail together, after the calamity had befallen us as much as before. We were now prepared for any thing.
<p/>We were to be dragged that morning fifteen miles behind horses, and then to be placed in the Easton jail. When we reached St. Michael's, we underwent a sort of examination.
<p/>We did this more to bring out the evidence against us, than from any hope of getting clear of being sold; for, as I have said, we were ready for that.
<p/>We all denied that we ever intended to run away. The fact was, we cared but little where we went, so we went together.
<p/>We found the evidence against us to be the testimony of one person; our master would not tell who it was; but we came to a unanimous decision among ourselves as to who their informant was.
<p/>Our greatest concern was about separation. We dreaded that more than any thing this side of death. We were sent off to the jail at Easton.
<p/>When we got there, we were delivered up to the sheriff, Mr. Joseph Graham, and by him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) placed in jail. Henry, John, and myself, were placed in one room together--Charles, and Henry Bailey, in another.
<p/>We had been in jail scarcely twenty minutes, when a swarm of slave traders, and agents for slave traders, flocked into jail to look at us, and to ascertain if we were for sale.
<p/>Their object in separating us was to hinder concert. Such a set of beings I never saw before! I felt myself surrounded by so many fiends from perdition.
<p/>A band of pirates never looked more like their father, the devil. They laughed and grinned over us, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my boys!
<p/>And after taunting us in various ways, they one by one went into an examination of us, with intent to ascertain our value.
<p/>we have got you, haven't we? ''  (<font color='red'><b>masters</b></font>)</div>They would impudently ask us if we would not like to have them for our masters.
<p/>Then they would curse and swear at us, telling us that they could take the devil out of us in a very little while, if we were only in their hands.
<p/>We would make them no answer, and leave them to find out as best they could. While in jail, we found ourselves in much more comfortable quarters than we expected when we went there.
<p/>We did not get much to eat, nor that which was very good; but we had a good clean room, from the windows of which we could see what was going on in the street, which was very much better than though we had been placed in one of the dark, damp cells.
<p/>Immediately after the holidays were over, contrary to all our expectations, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland came up to Easton, and took Charles, the two Henrys, and John, out of jail, and carried them home, leaving me alone.
<p/>Upon the whole, we got along very well, so far as the jail and its keeper were concerned. I regarded this separation as a final one.
<p/>It caused me more pain than any thing else in the whole transaction. I was ready for any thing rather than separation.
<p/>I supposed that they had consulted together, and had decided that, as I was the whole cause of the intention of the others to run away, it was hard to make the innocent suffer with the guilty; and that they had, therefore, concluded to take the others home, and sell me, as a warning to the others that remained.
<p/>It is due to the noble Henry to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seemed almost as reluctant at leaving the prison as at leaving home to come to the prison.
<p/>But we knew we should, in all probability, be separated, if we were sold; and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was in their hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) concluded to go peaceably home.
<p/>I was now left to my fate. I was all alone, and within the walls of a stone prison. But a few days before, and I was full of hope.
<p/>I expected to have been safe in a land of freedom; but now I was covered with gloom, sunk down to the utmost despair.
<p/>I was kept in this way about one week, at the end of which, Captain Auld, my master, to my surprise and utter astonishment, came up, and took me out, with the intention of sending me, with a gentleman of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) acquaintance, into Alabama.
<p/>But, from some cause or other, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not send me to Alabama, but concluded to send me back to Baltimore, to live again with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brother Hugh, and to learn a trade.
<p/>Thus, after an absence of three years and one month, I was once more permitted to return to my old home at Baltimore.
<p/>My master sent me away, because there existed against me a very great prejudice in the community, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) feared I might be killed.
<p/>In a few weeks after I went to Baltimore, Master Hugh hired me to Mr. William Gardner, an extensive ship-builder, on Fell's Point.
<p/>I thought the possibility of freedom was gone. I was put there to learn how to calk. It, however, proved a very unfavorable place for the accomplishment of this object.
<p/>The vessels were to be launched in the July of that year, and in failure thereof, Mr. Gardner was to lose a considerable sum; so that when I entered, all was hurry.
<p/>Mr. Gardner was engaged that spring in building two large man-of-war brigs, professedly for the Mexican government. There was no time to learn any thing.
<p/>Every man had to do that which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew how to do. In entering the shipyard, my orders from Mr. Gardner were, to do whatever the carpenters commanded me to do.
<p/>This was placing me at the beck and call of about seventy-five men. I was to regard all these as masters.
<p/>Their word was to be my law. My situation was a most trying one. At times I needed a dozen pair of hands.
<p/>I was called a dozen ways in the space of a single minute. Three or four voices would strike my ear at the same moment.
<p/>It was--<div class="bookquote">``Fred. , come help me to cant this timber here.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Fred., come carry this timber yonder.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Fred. , bring that roller here.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Fred., go get a fresh can of
<p/>, hold on the end of this fall.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Fred., go to the blacksmith's shop, and get a new punch.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Hurra, Fred! run and bring me a cold chisel.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``I say, Fred., bear a hand, and get up a fire as quick as lightning under that steam-box.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Halloo, nigger!
<p/>water.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Fred., come help saw off the end of this timber.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Fred., go quick, and get the crowbar.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Fred. come, turn this grindstone.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Come, come!
<p/>move, move! and bowse this timber forward.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``I say, darky , blast your eyes, why don't you heat up some pitch?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Halloo! halloo!
<p/>halloo! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Three voices at the same time.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Come here!--Go there!--Hold on where you are! Damn you, if you move, I'll knock your brains out!
<p/>This was my school for eight months; and I might have remained there longer, but for a most horrid fight I had with four of the white apprentices, in which my left eye was nearly knocked out, and I was horribly mangled in other respects.
<p/>The facts in the case were these: Until a very little while after I went there, white and black ship-carpenters worked side by side, and no one seemed to see any impropriety in it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All hands seemed to be very well satisfied. Many of the black carpenters were freemen. Things seemed to be going on very well.
<p/>Their reason for this, as alleged, was, that if free colored carpenters were encouraged, they would soon take the trade into their own hands, and poor white men would be thrown out of employment.
<p/>All at once, the white carpenters knocked off, and said they would not work with free colored workmen. They therefore felt called upon at once to put a stop to it.
<p/>And, taking advantage of Mr. Gardner's necessities, they broke off, swearing they would work no longer, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardner</b></font>) would discharge his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardner</b></font>) black carpenters.
<p/>Now, though this did not extend to me in form, it did reach me in fact. My fellow-apprentices very soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me.
<p/>They began to put on airs, and talk about the <div class="bookquote">``niggers''  (<font color='red'><b>the journeymen</b></font>)</div>taking the country, saying we all ought to be killed; and, being encouraged by the journeymen, they commenced making my condition as hard as they could, by hectoring me around, and sometimes striking me.
<p/>I, of course, kept the vow I made after the fight with Mr. Covey, and struck back again, regardless of consequences; and while I kept them from combining, I succeeded very well; for I could whip the whole of them, taking them separately.
<p/>They, however, at length combined, and came upon me, armed with sticks, stones, and heavy handspikes. One came in front with a half brick.
<p/>While I was attending to those in front, and on either side, the one behind ran up with the handspike, and struck me a heavy blow upon the head.
<p/>There was one at each side of me, and one behind me. It stunned me. I fell, and with this they all ran upon me, and fell to beating me with their fists.
<p/>I let them lay on for a while, gathering strength. In an instant, I gave a sudden surge, and rose to my hands and knees.
<p/>Just as I did that, one of their number gave me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) heavy boot, a powerful kick in the left eye.
<p/>My eyeball seemed to have burst. When they saw my eye closed, and badly swollen, they left me. With this I seized the handspike, and for a time pursued them.
<p/>But here the carpenters interfered, and I thought I might as well give it up. It was impossible to stand my hand against so many.
<p/>All this took place in sight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters, and not one interposed a friendly word; but some cried, <div class="bookquote">``Kill the damned nigger!
<p/>I succeeded in getting away without an additional blow, and barely so; for to strike a white man is death by Lynch law,--and that was the law in Mr. Gardner's ship-yard; nor is there much of any other out of Mr. Gardner's ship-yard.
<p/>I went directly home, and told the story of my wrongs to Master Hugh; and I am happy to say of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>), irreligious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) was, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) conduct was heavenly, compared with that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) brother Thomas under similar circumstances.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) listened attentively to my narration of the circumstances leading to the savage outrage, and gave many proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) strong indignation at it.
<p/>Kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>)! kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) struck a white person. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I found my only chance for life was in flight. The heart of my once overkind mistress was again melted into pity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) took a chair by me, washed the blood from my face, and, with a mother's tenderness, bound up my head, covering the wounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef.
<p/>It was almost compensation for my suffering to witness, once more, a manifestation of kindness from this, my once affectionate old mistress.
<p/>My puffed-out eye and blood-covered face moved her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to tears. Master Hugh was very much enraged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) gave expression to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) feelings by pouring out curses upon the heads of those who did the deed.
<p/>As soon as I got a little the better of my bruises, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) took me with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) to Esquire Watson's, on Bond Street, to see what could be done about the matter.
<p/>Master Hugh told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) it was done in Mr. Gardner's ship-yard at midday, where there were a large company of men at work.
<p/>Mr. Watson inquired who saw the assault committed. '' As to that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the deed was done, and there was no question as to who did it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) answer was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) could do nothing in the case, unless some white man would come forward and testify. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could issue no warrant on my word.
<p/>If I had been killed in the presence of a thousand colored people, their testimony combined would have been insufficient to have arrested one of the murderers.
<p/>Of course, it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) testimony in my behalf, and against the white young men.
<p/>Master Hugh, for once, was compelled to say this state of things was too bad. Even those who may have sympathized with me were not prepared to do this.
<p/>It required a degree of courage unknown to them to do so; for just at that time, the slightest manifestation of humanity toward a colored person was denounced as abolitionism, and that name subjected its bearer to frightful liabilities.
<p/>The watchwords of the bloody-minded in that region, and in those days, were, <div class="bookquote">``Damn the abolitionists!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Damn the niggers!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There was nothing done, and probably nothing would have been done if I had been killed.
<p/>Such was, and such remains, the state of things in the Christian city of Baltimore. Master Hugh, finding he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) could get no redress, refused to let me go back again to Mr. Gardner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gardner</b></font>) kept me himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardner</b></font>) wife dressed my wound till I was again restored to health. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gardner</b></font>) then took me into the ship-yard of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardner</b></font>) was foreman, in the employment of Mr. Walter Price.
<p/>In the course of one year from the time I left Mr. Gardner's, I was able to command the highest wages given to the most experienced calkers.
<p/>There I was immediately set to calking, and very soon learned the art of using my mallet and irons. I was now of some importance to my master.
<p/>I was bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) from six to seven dollars per week. I sometimes brought him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) nine dollars per week: my wages were a dollar and a half a day.
<p/>After learning how to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own contracts, and collected the money which I earned.
<p/>My pathway became much more smooth than before; my condition was now much more comfortable. When I could get no calking to do, I did nothing.
<p/>When in Mr. Gardner's employment, I was kept in such a perpetual whirl of excitement, I could think of nothing, scarcely, but my life; and in thinking of my life, I almost forgot my liberty.
<p/>During these leisure times, those old notions about freedom would steal over me again. I have observed this in my experience of slavery,--that
<p/>whenever my condition was improved, instead of its increasing my contentment, it only increased my desire to be free, and set me to thinking of plans to gain my freedom.
<p/>It is necessary to darken his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery; he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) can be brought to that only when he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) ceases to be a man.
<p/>I have found that, to make a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. I was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day.
<p/>I contracted for it; I earned it; it was paid to me; it was rightfully my own; yet, upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled to deliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh.
<p/>Not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) earned it,--not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) had any hand in earning it,--not because I owed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>),--nor because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) possessed the slightest shadow of a right to it; but solely because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) had the power to compel me to give it up.
<p/>I now come to that part of my life during which I planned, and finally succeeded in making, my escape from slavery.
<p/>But before narrating any of the peculiar circumstances, I deem it proper to make known my intention not to state all the facts connected with the transaction.
<p/>My reasons for pursuing this course may be understood from the following: First, were I to give a minute statement of all the facts, it is not only possible, but quite probable, that others would thereby be involved in the most embarrassing difficulties.
<p/>Secondly, such a statement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part of slaveholders than has existed heretofore among them; which would, of course, be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) galling chains.
<p/>And why? The right of the grim-visaged pirate upon the high seas is exactly the same. CHAPTER XI I deeply regret the necessity that impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my experience in slavery.
<p/>It would afford me great pleasure indeed, as well as materially add to the interest of my narrative, were I at liberty to gratify a curiosity, which I know exists in the minds of many, by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my most fortunate escape.
<p/>I would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which evil-minded men might suggest, rather than exculpate myself, and thereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a brother slave might clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery.
<p/>I have never approved of the very public manner in which some of our western friends have conducted what they call the underground railroad, but which I think, by their open declarations, has been made most emphatically the upper-ground railroad.
<p/>I honor those good men and women for their noble daring, and applaud them for willingly subjecting themselves to bloody persecution, by openly avowing their participation in the escape of slaves.
<p/>I, however, can see very little good resulting from such a course, either to themselves or the slaves escaping; while, upon the other hand, I see and feel assured that those open declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining, who are seeking to escape.
<p/>But I must deprive myself of this pleasure, and the curious of the gratification which such a statement would afford. They do nothing towards enlightening the slave, whilst they do much towards enlightening the master.
<p/>We owe something to the slave south of the line as well as to those north of it; and in aiding the latter on their way to freedom, we should be careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the former from escaping from slavery.
<p/>They stimulate him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) to greater watchfulness, and enhance his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) power to capture his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) slave. I would keep the merciless slaveholder profoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave.
<p/>I would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors, ever ready to snatch from his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) infernal grasp his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) trembling prey.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) be left to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) way in the dark; let darkness commensurate with his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) crime hover over him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>); and let him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) feel that at every step he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) takes, in pursuit of the flying bondman, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) is running the frightful risk of having his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) hot brains dashed out by an invisible agency.
<p/>Let us render the tyrant no aid; let us not hold the light by which he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) can trace the footprints of our flying brother.
<p/>I will now proceed to the statement of those facts, connected with my escape, for which I am alone responsible, and for which no one can be made to suffer but myself.
<p/>I could see no reason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my toil into the purse of my master.
<p/>When I carried to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) my weekly wages, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would, after counting the money, look me in the face with a robber-like fierceness, and ask, <div class="bookquote">``Is this all?
<p/>But enough of this. In the early part of the year 1838, I became quite restless. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would, however, when I made him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) six dollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourage me. It had the opposite effect.
<p/>The fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gave me any part of my wages was proof, to my mind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) believed me entitled to the whole of them.
<p/>I always felt worse for having received any thing; for I feared that the giving me a few cents would ease his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) conscience, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort of robber.
<p/>I was ever on the look-out for means of escape; and, finding no direct means, I determined to try to hire my time, with a view of getting money with which to make my escape.
<p/>In the spring of 1838, when Master Thomas came to Baltimore to purchase his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) spring goods, I got an opportunity, and applied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to allow me to hire my time.
<p/>I regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole. My discontent grew upon me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) unhesitatingly refused my request, and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) told me I could go nowhere but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could get me; and that, in the event of my running away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should spare no pains in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) efforts to catch me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) exhorted me to content myself, and be obedient. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) told me, if I would be happy, I must lay out no plans for the future.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) said, if I behaved myself properly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would take care of me. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future, and taught me to depend solely upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) for happiness.
<p/>But in spite of him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and even in spite of myself, I continued to think, and to think about the injustice of my enslavement, and the means of escape.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) seemed to see fully the pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature, in order to contentment in slavery. About two months after this, I applied to Master Hugh for the privilege of hiring my time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) too, at first, seemed disposed to refuse; but, after some reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) granted me the privilege, and proposed the following terms: I was to be allowed all my time, make all contracts with those for whom I worked, and find my own employment; and, in return for this liberty, I was to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) three dollars at the end of each week; find myself in calking tools, and in board and clothing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was not acquainted with the fact that I had applied to Master Thomas, and had been refused. My board was two dollars and a half per week.
<p/>This, with the wear and tear of clothing and calking tools, made my regular expenses about six dollars per week. This amount I was compelled to make up, or relinquish the privilege of hiring my time.
<p/>Rain or shine, work or no work, at the end of each week the money must be forthcoming, or I must give up my privilege.
<p/>This arrangement, it will be perceived, was decidedly in my master's favor. It relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) of all need of looking after me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) received all the benefits of slaveholding without its evils; while I endured all the evils of a slave, and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>freeman</b></font>) money was sure. I found it a hard bargain. But, hard as it was, I thought it better than the old mode of getting along.
<p/>It was a step towards freedom to be allowed to bear the responsibilities of a freeman, and I was determined to hold on upon it.
<p/>I was ready to work at night as well as day, and by the most untiring perseverance and industry, I made enough to meet my expenses, and lay up a little money every week.
<p/>I bent myself to the work of making money. I went on thus from May till August. Master Hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer.
<p/>The ground for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) refusal was a failure on my part, one Saturday night, to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) for my week's time.
<p/>During the week, I had entered into an engagement with a number of young friends to start from Baltimore to the camp ground early Saturday evening; and being detained by my employer, I was unable to get down to Master Hugh's without disappointing the company.
<p/>This failure was occasioned by my attending a camp meeting about ten miles from Baltimore. I knew that Master Hugh was in no special need of the money that night.
<p/>I therefore decided to go to camp meeting, and upon my return pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) the three dollars. I staid at the camp meeting one day longer than I intended when I left.
<p/>But as soon as I returned, I called upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) due. I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) very angry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) could scarce restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) wrath.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) had a great mind to give me a severe whipping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) wished to know how I dared go out of the city without asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) permission.
<p/>while I paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) the price which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) asked for it, I did not know that I was bound to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) when and where I should go.
<p/>This reply troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>); and, after reflecting a few moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) turned to me, and said I should hire my time no longer; that the next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) should know of, I would be running away.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) I hired my time and Upon the same plea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) told me to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith.
<p/>I did so; but instead of seeking work, as I had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time, I spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke of work.
<p/>I did this in retaliation. Saturday night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) called upon me as usual for my week's wages. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) I had no wages; I had done no work that week.
<p/>Here we were upon the point of coming to blows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) raved, and swore his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) determination to get hold of me.
<p/>I did not allow myself a single word; but was resolved, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) laid the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) hand upon me, it should be blow for blow.
<p/>I thought the matter over during the next day, Sunday, and finally resolved upon the third day of September, as the day upon which I would make a second attempt to secure my freedom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) did not strike me, but told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) would find me in constant employment in future. I now had three weeks during which to prepare for my journey.
<p/>Early on Monday morning, before Master Hugh had time to make any engagement for me, I went out and got employment of Mr. Butler, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) ship-yard near the drawbridge, upon what is called the City Block, thus making it unnecessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) to seek employment for me.
<p/>At the end of the week, I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) between eight and nine dollars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) seemed very well pleased, and asked why I did not do the same the week before.
<p/>My object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) might entertain of my intent to run away; and in this I succeeded admirably.
<p/>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) thought I was never better satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which I was planning my escape.
<p/>The second week passed, and again I carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) my full wages; and so well pleased was he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) gave me twenty-five cents, -LRB-quite a large sum for a slaveholder to give a slave,-RRB- and bade me to make a good use of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) little knew what my plans were. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) I would. Things went on without very smoothly indeed, but within there was trouble.
<p/>It is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of my contemplated start drew near. I had a number of warmhearted friends in Baltimore,--friends that I loved almost as I did my life,--and
<p/>It is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery, who now remain, but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to their friends.
<p/>the thought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond expression. The thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most painful thought with which I had to contend.
<p/>Besides the pain of separation, the dread and apprehension of a failure exceeded what I had experienced at my first attempt.
<p/>The love of them was my tender point, and shook my decision more than all things else. The appalling defeat I then sustained returned to torment me.
<p/>I felt assured that, if I failed in this attempt, my case would be a hopeless one--it would seal my fate as a slave forever.
<p/>I could not hope to get off with any thing less than the severest punishment, and being placed beyond the means of escape.
<p/>It required no very vivid imagination to depict the most frightful scenes through which I should have to pass, in case I failed.
<p/>But I remained firm, and, according to my resolution, on the third day of September, 1838, I left my chains, and succeeded in reaching New York without the slightest interruption of any kind.
<p/>The wretchedness of slavery, and the blessedness of freedom, were perpetually before me. It was life and death with me. How I did
<p/>so,--what means I adopted,--what direction I travelled, and by what mode of conveyance,--I must leave unexplained, for the reasons before mentioned.
<p/>I have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free State. I have never been able to answer the question with any satisfaction to myself.
<p/>I suppose I felt as one may imagine the unarmed mariner to feel when he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is rescued by a friendly man-of-war from the pursuit of a pirate.
<p/>In writing to a dear friend, immediately after my arrival at New York, I said I felt like one who had escaped a den of hungry lions.
<p/>This state of mind, however, very soon subsided; and I was again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness.
<p/>It was a moment of the highest excitement I ever experienced. I was yet liable to be taken back, and subjected to all the tortures of slavery.
<p/>There I was in the midst of thousands, and yet a perfect stranger; without home and without friends, in the midst of thousands of my own brethren--children of a common Father, and yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition.
<p/>I was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one, and thereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers, whose business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive, as the ferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey.
<p/>This in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm. But the loneliness overcame me. The motto which I adopted when I started from slavery was this--<div class="bookquote">``Trust no man!
<p/>It was a most painful situation; and, to understand it, one must needs experience it, or imagine himself in similar circumstances.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be a fugitive slave in a strange land--a land given up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders--whose inhabitants are legalized kidnappers--where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is every moment subjected to the terrible liability of being seized upon by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellowmen, as the hideous crocodile seizes upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prey!--I
<p/>say, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place himself in my situation--without home or friends--without money or credit--wanting shelter, and no one to give it--wanting bread, and no money to buy it,--and at the same time let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is pursued by merciless men-hunters, and in total darkness as to what to do, where to go, or where to stay,--perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and means of escape,--in the midst of plenty, yet suffering the terrible gnawings of hunger,--in the midst of houses, yet having no home,--among fellow-men, yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts, whose greediness to swallow up the trembling and half-famished fugitive is only equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which they subsist,--I say, let him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) be placed in this most trying situation,--the situation in which I was placed,--then, and not till then, will he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fully appreciate the hardships of, and know how to sympathize with, the toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I saw in every white man an enemy, and in almost every colored man cause for distrust. Thank Heaven, I remained but a short time in this distressed situation.
<p/>I was relieved from it by the humane hand of Mr. David Ruggles , whose vigilance, kindness, and perseverance, I shall never forget.
<p/>Mr. Ruggles is now afflicted with blindness, and is himself in need of the same kind offices which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) was once so forward in the performance of toward others.
<p/>I had been in New York but a few days, when Mr. Ruggles sought me out, and very kindly took me to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) boarding-house at the corner of Church and Lespenard Streets.
<p/>Mr. Ruggles was then very deeply engaged in the memorable Darg case, as well as attending to a number of other fugitive slaves, devising ways and means for their successful escape; and, though watched and hemmed in on almost every side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) seemed to be more than a match for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) enemies.
<p/>Very soon after I went to Mr. Ruggles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) wished to know of me where I wanted to go; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) deemed it unsafe for me to remain in New York.
<p/>I am glad of an opportunity to express, as far as words can, the love and gratitude I bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>). I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) I was a calker, and should like to go where I could get work.
<p/>I thought of going to Canada; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ruggles</b></font>) decided against it, and in favor of my going to New Bedford, thinking I should be able to get work there at my trade.
<p/>At this time, Anna,* my intended wife, came on; for I wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) immediately after my arrival at New York, -LRB-notwithstanding my homeless, houseless, and helpless condition,-RRB- informing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of my successful flight, and wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to come on forthwith.
<p/>In a few days after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arrival, Mr. Ruggles called in the Rev. J. W. C. Pennington, who, in the presence of Mr. Ruggles, Mrs. Michaels, and two or three others, performed the marriage ceremony, and gave us a certificate, of which the following is an exact copy:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This may certify, that I joined together in holy matrimony Frederick Johnson ** and Anna Murray, as man and wife, in the presence of Mr. David Ruggles and Mrs. Michaels.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>JAMES W. C. PENNINGTON '' New York, Sept. 15, 1838 '' * She (<font color='blue'><b>Michaels</b></font>) was free. * * I had changed my name from Frederick Bailey to that of Johnson .
<p/>Upon receiving this certificate, and a five-dollar bill from Mr. Ruggles, I shouldered one part of our baggage, and Anna took up the other, and we set out forthwith to take passage on board of the steamboat John W. Richmond for Newport, on our way to New Bedford.
<p/>Mr. Ruggles gave me a letter to a Mr. Shaw in Newport, and told me, in case my money did not serve me to New Bedford, to stop in Newport and obtain further assistance; but upon our arrival at Newport, we were so anxious to get to a place of safety, that, notwithstanding we lacked the necessary money to pay our fare, we decided to take seats in the stage, and promise to pay when we got to New Bedford.
<p/>We were encouraged to do this by two excellent gentlemen, residents of New Bedford, whose names I afterward ascertained to be Joseph Ricketson and William C. Taber.
<p/>They seemed at once to understand our circumstances, and gave us such assurance of their friendliness as put us fully at ease in their presence.
<p/>Upon reaching New Bedford, we were directed to the house of Mr. Nathan Johnson, by whom we were kindly received, and hospitably provided for.
<p/>It was good indeed to meet with such friends, at such a time. Both Mr. and Mrs. Johnson took a deep and lively interest in our welfare.
<p/>When the stage-driver found us unable to pay our fare, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) held on upon our baggage as security for the debt.
<p/>They proved themselves quite worthy of the name of abolitionists. I had but to mention the fact to Mr. Johnson, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) forthwith advanced the money.
<p/>We now began to feel a degree of safety, and to prepare ourselves for the duties and responsibilities of a life of freedom.
<p/>On the morning after our arrival at New Bedford, while at the breakfast-table, the question arose as to what name I should be called by.
<p/>I, however, had dispensed with the two middle names long before I left Maryland so that I was generally known by the name of ``Frederick Bailey.
<p/>The name given me by my mother was, <div class="bookquote">``Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey. ''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>'' I started from Baltimore bearing the name of ``Stanley.
<p/>When I got to New York, I again changed my name to <div class="bookquote">``Frederick Johnson,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and thought that would be the last change.
<p/>The reason of this necessity was, that there were so many Johnsons in New Bedford, it was already quite difficult to distinguish between them.
<p/>I gave Mr. Johnson the privilege of choosing me a name, but told him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) must not take from me the name of <div class="bookquote">``Frederick.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But when I got to New Bedford, I found it necessary again to change my name. '' I must hold on to that, to preserve a sense of my identity.
<p/>Mr. Johnson had just been reading the <div class="bookquote">``Lady of the Lake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Johnson/Mr. Nathan Johnson</b></font>)</div>and at once suggested that my name be <div class="bookquote">``Douglass. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Johnson/Mr. Nathan Johnson</b></font>)</div><p/>From that time until now I have been called <div class="bookquote">``Frederick Douglass;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and as I am more widely known by that name than by either of the others, I shall continue to use it as my own.
<p/>The impression which I had received respecting the character and condition of the people of the north, I found to be singularly erroneous.
<p/>I had very strangely supposed, while in slavery, that few of the comforts, and scarcely any of the luxuries, of life were enjoyed at the north, compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the south.
<p/>I was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New Bedford. I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern people owned no slaves.
<p/>I knew they were exceedingly poor, and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders.
<p/>I had somehow imbibed the opinion that, in the absence of slaves, there could be no wealth, and very little refinement.
<p/>And upon coming to the north, I expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, and uncultivated population, living in the most Spartan-like simplicity, knowing nothing of the ease, luxury, pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders.
<p/>Such being my conjectures, any one acquainted with the appearance of New Bedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my mistake.
<p/>In the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford, I visited the wharves, to take a view of the shipping.
<p/>I supposed that they were about upon a level with the non-slaveholding population of the south. Here I found myself surrounded with the strongest proofs of wealth.
<p/>Lying at the wharves, and riding in the stream, I saw many ships of the finest model, in the best order, and of the largest size.
<p/>Upon the right and left, I was walled in by granite warehouses of the widest dimensions, stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life.
<p/>Added to this, almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore.
<p/>There were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships. I heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer.
<p/>Every man appeared to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, and went at it with a sober, yet cheerful earnestness, which betokened the deep interest which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt in what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was doing, as well as a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own dignity as a man.
<p/>From the wharves I strolled around and over the town, gazing with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches, beautiful dwellings, and finely-cultivated gardens; evincing an amount of wealth, comfort, taste, and refinement, such as I had never seen in any part of slaveholding Maryland.
<p/>I saw no whipping of men; but all seemed to go smoothly on. To me this looked exceedingly strange. Every thing looked clean, new, and beautiful.
<p/>I saw few or no dilapidated houses, with poverty-stricken inmates; no half-naked children and barefooted women, such as I had been accustomed to see in Hillsborough, Easton, St. Michael's, and Baltimore.
<p/>The people looked more able, stronger, healthier, and happier, than those of Maryland. I was for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth, without being saddened by seeing extreme poverty.
<p/>But the most astonishing as well as the most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored people, a great many of whom, like myself, had escaped thither as a refuge from the hunters of men.
<p/>I found many, who had not been seven years out of their chains, living in finer houses, and evidently enjoying more of the comforts of life, than the average of slaveholders in Maryland.
<p/>I will venture to assert, that my friend Mr. Nathan Johnson -LRB-of whom I can say with a grateful heart, <div class="bookquote">``I was hungry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) gave me drink; I was a stranger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) took me in'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-RRB- lived in a neater house; dined at a better table; took, paid for, and read, more newspapers; better understood the moral, religious, and political character of the nation,--than nine tenths of the slaveholders in Talbot county Maryland.
<p/>Yet Mr. Johnson was a working man. His (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) hands were hardened by toil, and not his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) alone, but those also of Mrs. Johnson.
<p/>I found the colored people much more spirited than I had supposed they would be. I found among them a determination to protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper, at all hazards.
<p/>Soon after my arrival, I was told of a circumstance which illustrated their spirit. A colored man and a fugitive slave were on unfriendly terms.
<p/>The former was heard to threaten the latter with informing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whereabouts. Straightway a meeting was called among the colored people, under the stereotyped notice, <div class="bookquote">``Business of importance!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>The people came at the appointed hour, and organized the meeting by appointing a very religious old gentleman as president, who, I believe, made a prayer, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) addressed the meeting as follows: '' Friends, we have got him (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) here, and I would recommend that you young men just take him (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) outside the door, and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>)! ''
<p/>With this, a number of them bolted at him (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>); but they were intercepted by some more timid than themselves, and the betrayer escaped their vengeance, and has not been seen in New Bedford since.
<p/>I believe there have been no more such threats, and should there be hereafter, I doubt not that death would be the consequence.
<p/>The betrayer was invited to attend. I found employment, the third day after my arrival, in stowing a sloop with a load of oil.
<p/>It was new, dirty, and hard work for me; but I went at it with a glad heart and a willing hand.
<p/>I was now my own master. It was a happy moment, the rapture of which can be understood only by those who have been slaves.
<p/>It was the first work, the reward of which was to be entirely my own. There was no Master Hugh standing ready, the moment I earned the money, to rob me of it.
<p/>I worked that day with a pleasure I had never before experienced. I was at work for myself and newly-married wife.
<p/>When I got through with that job, I went in pursuit of a job of calking; but such was the strength of prejudice against color, among the white calkers, that they refused to work with me, and of course I could get no employment.
<p/>It was to me the starting-point of a new existence. * * I am told that colored persons can now get employment at calking in New
<p/>Finding my trade of no immediate benefit, I threw off my calking habiliments, and prepared myself to do any kind of work I could get to do.
<p/>Bedford--a result of anti-slavery effort. Mr. Johnson kindly let me have his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) wood-horse and saw, and I very soon found myself a plenty of work.
<p/>I was ready to saw wood, shovel coal, carry wood, sweep the chimney, or roll oil casks,--all of which I did for nearly three years in New Bedford, before I became known to the anti-slavery world.
<p/>In about four months after I went to New Bedford, there came a young man to me, and inquired if I did not wish to take the <div class="bookquote">``Liberator.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I did; but, just having made my escape from slavery, I remarked that I was unable to pay for it then.
<p/>The paper came, and I read it from week to week with such feelings as it would be quite idle for me to attempt to describe.
<p/>There was no work too hard--none too dirty. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I, however, finally became a subscriber to it. The paper became my meat and my drink.
<p/>Its sympathy for my brethren in bonds--its scathing denunciations of slaveholders--its faithful exposures of slavery--and its powerful attacks upon the upholders of the institution--sent a thrill of joy through my soul, such as I had never felt before!
<p/>I had not long been a reader of the <div class="bookquote">``Liberator,''  (<font color='red'><b>a reader</b></font>)</div>before I got a pretty correct idea of the principles, measures and spirit of the anti-slavery reform.
<p/>I could do but little; but what I could, I did with a joyful heart, and never felt happier than when in an anti-slavery meeting.
<p/>I seldom had much to say at the meetings, because what I wanted to say was said so much better by others.
<p/>But, while attending an anti-slavery convention at Nantucket, on the 11th of August, 1841, I felt strongly moved to speak, and was at the same time much urged to do so by Mr. William C. Coffin, a gentleman who had heard me speak in the colored people's meeting at New Bedford.
<p/>My soul was set all on fire. I took right hold of the cause. It was a severe cross, and I took it up reluctantly.
<p/>The truth was, I felt myself a slave, and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me down. I spoke but
<p/>From that time until now, I have been engaged in pleading the cause of my brethren--with what success, and with what devotion, I leave those acquainted with my labors to decide.
<p/>APPENDIX I find, since reading over the foregoing Narrative, that I have, in several instances, spoken in such a tone and manner, respecting religion, as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my religious views to suppose me an opponent of all religion.
<p/>a few moments, when I felt a degree of freedom, and said what I desired with considerable ease. To remove the liability of such misapprehension, I deem it proper to append the following brief explanation.
<p/>What I have said respecting and against religion, I mean strictly to apply to the slaveholding religion of this land, and with no possible reference to Christianity proper; for, between the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest possible difference--so wide, that to receive the one as good, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, and wicked.
<p/>I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land.
<p/>To be the friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy of the other. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity.
<p/>I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels.
<p/>Never was there a clearer case of <div class="bookquote">``stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious pomp and show, together with the horrible inconsistencies, which every where surround me.
<p/>The man who wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday, and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus.
<p/>The man who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me as a class-leader on Sunday morning, to show me the way of life, and the path of salvation.
<p/>We have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who sells my sister, for purposes of prostitution, stands forth as the pious advocate of purity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>advocate</b></font>) who proclaims it a religious duty to read the Bible denies me the right of learning to read the name of the God who made me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who is the religious advocate of marriage robs whole millions of its sacred influence, and leaves them to the ravages of wholesale pollution.
<p/>The warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same that scatters whole families,--sundering husbands and wives, parents and children, sisters and brothers,--leaving the hut vacant, and the hearth desolate.
<p/>We have men sold to build churches, women sold to support the gospel, and babes sold to purchase Bibles for the Poor Heathen!
<p/>We see the thief preaching against theft, and the adulterer against adultery. All For The Glory Of God And The Good Of Souls!
<p/>The slave auctioneer's bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other, and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) pious master.
<p/>Revivals of religion and revivals in the slave-trade go hand in hand together. The slave prison and the church stand near each other.
<p/>The clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in the prison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church, may be heard at the same time.
<p/>The dealers in the bodies and souls of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other.
<p/>The dealer gives his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) infernal business with the garb of Christianity.
<p/>Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other--devils dressed in angels' robes, and hell presenting the semblance of paradise.
<p/>'' Just God! and these are they, Who minister at thine altar, God of right! Men who their hands, with prayer and blessing, lay On Israel's ark of light.
<p/>'' What! preach, and kidnap men? Give thanks, and rob thy own afflicted poor? Talk of thy glorious liberty, and then Bolt hard the captive's door?
<p/>servants of thy own Merciful Son, who came to seek and save The homeless and the outcast, fettering down The tasked and plundered slave!
<p/>'' What! '' Pilate and Herod friends! Chief priests and rulers, as of old, combine! Just God and holy! is that church which lends Strength to the spoiler thine?''
<p/>The Christianity of America is a Christianity, of whose votaries it may be as truly said, as it was of the ancient scribes and Pharisees, <div class="bookquote">``They bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
<p/>All their works they do for to be seen of men.--They love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, ... .
<p/>and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.--But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer
<p/>ye them that are entering to go in. Ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
<p/>Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) is made, ye make him (<font color='blue'><b>Rabbi</b></font>) twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.--Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
<p/>for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
<p/>for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but within, they are full of extortion and excess.--Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
<p/>for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
<p/>Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
<p/>Dark and terrible as is this picture, I hold it to be strictly true of the overwhelming mass of professed Christians in America.
<p/>They would be shocked at the proposition of fellowshipping a sheep -stealer; and at the same time they hug to their communion a man -stealer, and brand me with being an infidel, if I find fault with them for it.
<p/>They attend with Pharisaical strictness to the outward forms of religion, and at the same time neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pharisees</b></font>)</div>They strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. Could any thing be more true of our churches? They are always ready to sacrifice, but seldom to show mercy.
<p/>They are they who are represented as professing to love God whom they have not seen, whilst they hate their brother whom they have seen.
<p/>They can pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), pay money to have the Bible put into his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand, and missionaries to instruct him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); while they despise and totally neglect the heathen at their own doors.
<p/>Such is, very briefly, my view of the religion of this land; and to avoid any misunderstanding, growing out of the use of general terms, I mean by the religion of this land, that which is revealed in the words, deeds, and actions, of those bodies, north and south, calling themselves Christian churches, and yet in union with slaveholders.
<p/>They love the heathen on the other side of the globe. It is against religion, as presented by these bodies, that I have felt it my duty to testify.
<p/>I conclude these remarks by copying the following portrait of the religion of the south, -LRB-which is, by communion and fellowship, the religion of the north,-RRB- which I soberly affirm is <div class="bookquote">``true to the life,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and without caricature or the slightest exaggeration.
<p/>It is said to have been drawn, several years before the present anti-slavery agitation began, by a northern Methodist preacher, who, while residing at the south, had an opportunity to see slaveholding morals, manners, and piety, with his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) own eyes.
<p/>'' Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord. Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
<p/>'' <b> A PARODY</b> <div class="bookquote">``Come, saints and sinners, hear me tell How pious priests whip Jack and Nell, And women buy and children sell,
<p/>They'll bleat and baa, dona like goats, Gorge down black sheep, and strain at motes, Array their backs in fine black coats, Then seize their negroes by their throats, And choke, for heavenly union.
<p/>And preach all sinners down to hell, And sing of heavenly union. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' They'll church you if you sip a dram,
<p/>And damn you if you steal a lamb; Yet rob old Tony, Doll, and Sam, Of human rights, and bread and ham; Kidnapper's heavenly union.
<p/>They'll loudly talk of Christ's reward, And bind his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) image with a cord, And scold, and swing the lash abhorred, And sell their brother in the Lord To handcuffed heavenly union.
<p/>They'll read and sing a sacred song, And make a prayer both loud and long, And teach the right and do the wrong, Hailing the brother, sister throng,
<p/>We wonder how such saints can sing, Or praise the Lord upon the wing, Who roar, and scold, and whip, and sting,
<p/>They'll raise tobacco, corn, and rye, And drive, and thieve, and cheat, and lie, And lay up treasures in the sky, By making switch and cowskin fly,
<p/>'' '' With words of heavenly union. '' And to their slaves and mammon cling, In guilty conscience union. '' In hope of heavenly union.
<p/>They'll crack old Tony on the skull, And preach and roar like Bashan bull, Or braying ass, of mischief full, Then seize old Jacob by the wool, And pull for heavenly union.
<p/>A roaring, ranting, sleek man-thief, Who lived on mutton, veal, and beef, Yet never would afford relief To needy, sable sons of grief, Was big with heavenly union.
<p/>And winked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eye, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) head; He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) seized on Tom, and Dick, and Ned, Cut short their meat, and clothes, and bread, Yet still loved heavenly union.
<p/>'' '' '' ' Love not the world,' the preacher said, '' Another preacher whining spoke Of One whose heart for sinners broke:
<p/>Two others oped their iron jaws, And waved their children-stealing paws; There sat their children in gewgaws; By stinting negroes' backs and maws, They kept up heavenly union.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) tied old Nanny to an oak, And drew the blood at every stroke, And prayed for heavenly union. '' ''
<p/>All good from Jack another takes, And entertains their flirts and rakes, Who dress as sleek as glossy snakes, And cram their mouths with sweetened cakes; And this goes down for union.
<p/>Sincerely and earnestly hoping that this little book may do something toward throwing light on the American slave system, and hastening the glad day of deliverance to the millions of my brethren in bonds--faithfully relying upon the power of truth, love, and justice, for success in my humble efforts--and solemnly pledging my self anew to the sacred cause,--I subscribe myself, FREDERICK DOUGLASS.
