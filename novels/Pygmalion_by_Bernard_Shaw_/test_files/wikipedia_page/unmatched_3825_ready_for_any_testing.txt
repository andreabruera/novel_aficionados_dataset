for for other stage performances see pygmalion it was first presented on stage to the public in in ancient greek mythology pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures which then came to life
the general idea of that myth was popular subject for victorian era english playwrights including one of shaw influences s gilbert who wrote successful play based on the story called pygmalion and galatea that was first presented in
shaw would also have been familiar with the burlesque version galatea or pygmalion reversed shaw play has been adapted numerous time most notably as the musical my fair lady and its film version
shaw mentioned that the character of professor henry_higgins mrs_higgins was inspired by several british professors of phonetics alexander melville bell alexander ellis tito pagliardini but above all the cantankerous henry_higgins sweet
a sketch magazine illustration of mrs patrick campbell as eliza_doolittle from april shaw wrote the part of eliza_doolittle expressly for campbell who played opposite herbert beerbohm tree as henry_higgins mrs_higgins
after creating the role of col pickering in the london production philip merivale second from right played henry_higgins mrs_higgins opposite mrs patrick campbell
right when pygmalion was taken to broadway shaw wrote the play in early and read it to famed actress mrs patrick campbell in june
pygmalion premiered at the hofburg theatre in vienna on october in german translation by shaw viennese literary agent and acolyte siegfried trebitsch
she came on board almost immediately but her mild nervous breakdown contributed to the delay of london production its first new york production opened on march at the german language irving place theatre
it opened in london on april at sir herbert beerbohm tree his majesty theatre and starred mrs campbell as eliza_doolittle and tree as mrs_higgins running for performances
shaw directed the actors through tempestuous rehearsals often punctuated by at least one of the two storming out of the theatre in rage
portico of saint paul church not wren cathedral but inigo jones church in covent garden vegetable market m a group of people are sheltering from the rain
among them are the eynsford hills superficial social climbers eking out living in genteel poverty consisting initially of mrs eynsford hill and her daughter clara
clara brother freddy enters having earlier been dispatched to secure them cab which they can ill afford but being rather timid and faint hearted he has failed to do so
as he goes off once again to find cab he bumps into flower girl eliza_doolittle her flower drop into the mud of covent garden the flower she needs to survive in her poverty stricken world
shortly they are joined by gentleman colonel pickering while eliza_doolittle tries to sell flower to the colonel bystander informs her that man is writing down everything she says
the man is henry_higgins mrs_higgins professor of phonetics eliza_doolittle worries that mrs_higgins is police officer and will not calm down until mrs_higgins introduces himself
it soon becomes apparent that he and colonel pickering have shared interest in phonetics indeed pickering has come from india to meet mrs_higgins and mrs_higgins was planning to go to india to meet pickering
these word of bravado spark an interest in eliza_doolittle who would love to make changes in her life and become more mannerly even though to her it only means working in flower shop
at the end of the act freddy returns after finding taxi only to find that his mother and sister have gone and left him with the cab
the streetwise eliza_doolittle takes the cab from him using the money that mrs_higgins tossed to her leaving him on his own
lynn fontanne eliza_doolittle and henry_higgins travers alfred eliza_doolittle in the theatre guild production of pygmalion as mrs_higgins demonstrates his phonetics to pickering the housekeeper mrs_pearce tells him that young girl wants to see him
mrs_higgins tells pickering that he could pass off the flower girl as duchess merely by teaching her to speak properly eliza_doolittle has shown up because she wishes to talk like lady in flower shop
she tells mrs_higgins that she will pay for lessons he shows no interest but she reminds him of his boast the previous day
mrs_higgins claimed that he could pass her for duchess pickering makes bet with him on his claim and says that he will pay for her lessons if mrs_higgins succeeds
mrs_pearce tells mrs_higgins that he must behave himself in the young girl presence meaning he must stop swearing and improve his table manners but he is at loss to understand why she should find fault with him
alfred eliza_doolittle eliza_doolittle father appears with the sole purpose of getting money out of mrs_higgins having no paternal interest in his daughter welfare
she is sent off to have bath he sees himself as member of the undeserving poor and means to go on being undeserving
he is also aggressive and when eliza_doolittle on her return sticks her tongue out at him he goes to hit her but is prevented by pickering
with his intelligent mind untamed by education he has an eccentric view of life the scene ends with mrs_higgins telling pickering that they really have got difficult job on their hand
mrs_higgins is not very impressed with her son attempts to win her approval because it is her at home day and she is entertaining visitors
mrs_higgins bursts in and tells his mother he has picked up common flower girl whom he has been teaching the visitors are the eynsford hills
mrs_higgins is rude to them on their arrival eliza_doolittle enters and soon falls into talking about the weather and her family
whilst she is now able to speak in beautifully modulated tones the substance of what she says remains unchanged from the gutter
she confides her suspicions that her aunt was killed by relatives and mentions that gin had been mother milk to this aunt and that eliza_doolittle own father was always more cheerful after goodly amount of gin
when she is leaving he asks her if she is going to walk across the park to which she replies walk
this is the most famous line from the play and for many year after the play debut use of the word bloody was known as pygmalion mrs campbell was considered to have risked her career by speaking the line on stage
mrs_higgins passes off her remarks as the new small talk and freddy is enraptured after she and the eynsford hills leave henry_higgins asks for his mother opinion
she says the girl is not presentable and is very concerned about what will happen to her but neither mrs_higgins nor pickering understands her thoughts of eliza_doolittle future and leave feeling confident and excited about how eliza_doolittle will get on
this leaves mrs_higgins feeling exasperated and exclaiming man mrs_higgins pickering and eliza_doolittle have returned from ball a tired eliza_doolittle sits unnoticed brooding and silent while pickering congratulates mrs_higgins on winning the bet
mrs_higgins scoffs and declares the evening silly tomfoolery thanking god it over and saying that he had been sick of the whole thing for the last two months
still barely acknowledging eliza_doolittle beyond asking her to leave note for mrs_pearce regarding coffee the two retire to bed mrs_higgins returns to the room looking for his slipper and eliza_doolittle throws them at him
mrs_higgins is taken aback and is at first completely unable to understand eliza_doolittle preoccupation which aside from being ignored after her triumph is the question of what she is to do now
when mrs_higgins does understand he makes light of it saying she could get married but eliza_doolittle interprets this as selling herself like prostitute
finally she returns her jewellery to mrs_higgins including the ring he had given her which he throws into the fireplace with violence that scares eliza_doolittle
furious with himself for losing his temper he damns mrs_pearce the coffee and then eliza_doolittle and finally himself for lavishing his knowledge and his regard and intimacy on heartless guttersnipe and retires in great dudgeon
we were above that at the corner of tottenham court road eliza_doolittle roots around in the fireplace and retrieves the ring
mrs_higgins drawing room the next morning mrs_higgins and pickering perturbed by the discovery that eliza_doolittle has walked out on them call on mrs_higgins to phone the police
mrs_higgins is particularly distracted since eliza_doolittle had assumed the responsibility of maintaining his diary and keeping track of his possessions which causes mrs_higgins to decry their calling the police as though eliza_doolittle were a lost umbrella
eliza_doolittle is announced he emerges dressed in splendid wedding attire and is furious with mrs_higgins who after their previous encounter had been so taken with eliza_doolittle unorthodox ethics that he had recommended him as the most original moralist in england to rich american founding moral reform societies the american had subsequently left eliza_doolittle pension worth three thousand pounds year as consequence of which eliza_doolittle feels intimidated into joining the middle class and marrying his missus
mrs_higgins observes that this at least settles the problem of who shall provide for eliza_doolittle to which mrs_higgins objects after all he paid eliza_doolittle five pounds for her
mrs_higgins informs her son that eliza_doolittle is upstairs and explains the circumstances of her arrival alluding to how marginalised and overlooked eliza_doolittle felt the previous night
mrs_higgins is unable to appreciate this and sulks when told that he must behave if eliza_doolittle is to join them eliza_doolittle is asked to wait outside
throwing mrs_higgins previous insults back at him oh i only squashed cabbage leaf eliza_doolittle remarks that it was only by pickering example that she learned to be lady which renders mrs_higgins speechless
eliza_doolittle goes on to say that she has completely left behind the flower girl she was and that she couldnt utter any of her old sounds if she tried at which point eliza_doolittle emerges from the balcony causing eliza_doolittle to relapse totally into her gutter speech
eliza_doolittle enters at ease and self possessed mrs_higgins blusters but eliza_doolittle isnt shaken and speaks exclusively to pickering mrs_higgins is jubilant jumping up and crowing over her
eliza_doolittle explains his situation and asks if eliza_doolittle will come with him to his wedding pickering and mrs_higgins also agree to go and leave with eliza_doolittle and eliza_doolittle to follow
mrs_higgins asks if eliza_doolittle is satisfied with the revenge she has brought thus far and if she will now come back but she refuses
mrs_higgins defends himself from eliza_doolittle earlier accusation by arguing that he treats everyone the same so she shouldnt feel singled out
eliza_doolittle replies that she just wants little kindness and that since he will never stop to show her this she will not come back but will marry freddy
the scene ends with another confrontation between mrs_higgins and eliza_doolittle mrs_higgins scolds her for such low ambitions he has made her a consort for king
when she threatens to teach phonetics and offer herself as an assistant to nepommuck mrs_higgins again loses his temper and promises to wring her neck if she does so
eliza_doolittle realises that this last threat strikes mrs_higgins at the very core and that it gives her power over him mrs_higgins for his part is delighted to see spark of fight in eliza_doolittle rather than her erstwhile fretting and worrying
he remarks i like you like this and calls her pillar of strength mrs_higgins returns and she and eliza_doolittle depart for the wedding
as they leave mrs_higgins incorrigibly gives eliza_doolittle number of errands to run as though their recent conversation had not taken place
eliza_doolittle disdainfully explains why they are unnecessary and wonders what mrs_higgins is going to do without her in another version eliza_doolittle disdainfully tells him to do the errands himself mrs_higgins says that she ll get the items but mrs_higgins cheerfully tells her that eliza_doolittle will do it after all
mrs_higgins laughs to himself at the idea of eliza_doolittle marrying freddy as the play ends the play was well received by critics in major cities following its premieres in vienna london and new york
the initial release in vienna garnered several reviews describing the show as positive departure from shaw usual dry and didactic style
the broadway premiere in new york was praised in terms of both plot and acting described as a love story with brusque diffidence and wealth of humor
reviews of the production in london were slightly less unequivocally positive with the telegraph noting that the play was deeply diverting with interesting mechanical staging although the critic ultimately found the production somewhat shallow and overly lengthy
the london time however praised both the characters and actors especially sir herbert tree as mrs_higgins and mrs patrick campbell as eliza_doolittle and the happy if unconventional ending
but popular audiences looking for pleasant entertainment with big stars in west end venue wanted happy ending for the characters they liked so well as did some critics
during the run to shaw exasperation but not to his surprise tree sought to sweeten shaw ending to please himself and his record houses
pygmalion was the most broadly appealing of all shaw plays shaw returned for the performance and watched mrs_higgins standing at the window toss bouquet down to eliza_doolittle
my ending makes money you ought to be grateful protested tree to which shaw replied your ending is damnable you ought to be shot
to the print edition for inclusion with subsequent editions in which he explained precisely why it was impossible for the story to end with mrs_higgins and eliza_doolittle getting married
he continued to protect what he saw as the play and eliza_doolittle integrity by protecting the last scene for at least some performances during the revival shaw adjusted the ending in way that underscored the shavian message
in an undated note to mrs campbell he wrote when eliza_doolittle emancipates herself when galatea comes to life she must not relapse
when mrs_higgins takes your arm on consort battleship you must instantly throw him off with implacable pride and this is the note until the final buy them yourself
she must retain her pride and triumph to the end he will go out on the balcony to watch your departure come back triumphantly into the room exclaim galatea
meaning that the statue has come to life at last and curtain thus he gets the last word and you get it too
this ending however is not included in any print version of the play shaw fought against mrs_higgins eliza_doolittle happy end pairing as late as
he sent the film version producer gabriel pascal concluding sequence which he felt offered fair compromise tender farewell scene between mrs_higgins and eliza_doolittle followed by one showing freddy and eliza_doolittle happy in their greengrocery flower shop
only at the sneak preview did he learn that pascal had finessed the question of eliza_doolittle future with slightly ambiguous final scene in which eliza_doolittle returns to the house of sadly musing mrs_higgins and self mockingly quotes her previous self announcing i washed my face and hand before come did
first american serialized publication everybody magazine november different printed versions of the play omit or add certain lines i could pass you off as the queen of sheba
a line so famous that it is now retained in nearly all productions of the play including the film version of pygmalion as well as in the stage and film versions of my fair lady
the co director of the film anthony asquith had seen mrs campbell in the revival of pygmalion and noticed that she spoke the line it my belief as how they done the old woman in
he knew as how was not in shaw text but he felt it added color and rhythm to eliza_doolittle speech and liked to think that mrs campbell had ad libbed it herself
eighteen year later he added it to wendy hiller line in the film in the original play eliza_doolittle test is met at an ambassador garden party offstage
for the film shaw and co writers replaced that exposition with scene at an embassy ball nepomuck the blackmailing translator spoken about in the play is finally seen but his name is updated to aristid karpathy named so by gabriel pascal the film hungarian producer who also made sure that karpathy mistakes eliza_doolittle for hungarian princess
the change of name was likely to avoid offending the sensibilities of roman catholics as st john nepomuk was ironically catholic martyr who refused to divulge the secrets of the confessional
the film also introduced the famous pronunciation exercises the rain in spain stays mainly in the plain and in hertford hereford and hampshire hurricanes hardly ever happen
shaw screen version of the play as well as new print version incorporating the new sequences he had added for the film script were published in
in my fair lady he became zoltan karpathy neither of these appears in the original play the scenes he had noted in note for technicians are added
pygmalion remains shaw most popular play the play widest audiences know it as the inspiration for the highly romanticized musical and film my fair lady
