<p/>As will be seen later on, Pygmalion needs, not a preface, but a sequel, which I have supplied in its due place.
<p/>PYGMALION BERNARD SHAW 1912 TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: This etext edition restores the omitted apostrophes. PREFACE TO PYGMALION. A Professor of Phonetics. The English have no respect for their language, and will not teach their children to speak it.
<p/>They spell it so abominably that no man can teach himself what it sounds like. It is impossible for an Englishman to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>).
<p/>The reformer England needs today is an energetic phonetic enthusiast: that is why I have made such a one the hero of a popular play.
<p/>German and Spanish are accessible to foreigners: English is not accessible even to Englishmen. There have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for many years past.
<p/>When I became interested in the subject towards the end of the eighteen-seventies, Melville Bell was dead; but Alexander J. Ellis was still a living patriarch, with an impressive head always covered by a velvet skull cap, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>) would apologize to public meetings in a very courtly manner.
<p/>Henry Sweet, then a young man, lacked their sweetness of character: he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) was about as conciliatory to conventional mortals as Ibsen or Samuel Butler.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) great ability as a phonetician -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) was, I think, the best of them all at his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) job-RRB- would have entitled him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) to high official recognition, and perhaps enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) to popularize his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) subject, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) Satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in general who thought more of Greek than of phonetics.
<p/>Once, in the days when the Imperial Institute rose in South Kensington, and Joseph Chamberlain was booming the Empire, I induced the editor of a leading monthly review to commission an article from Sweet on the imperial importance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) subject.
<p/>When it arrived, it contained nothing but a savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature whose chair Sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only.
<p/>The article, being libelous, had to be returned as impossible; and I had to renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight.
<p/>When I met him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) afterwards, for the first time for many years, I found to my astonishment that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>), who had been a quite tolerably presentable young man, had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) personal appearance until he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) had become a sort of walking repudiation of Oxford and all its traditions.
<p/>It must have been largely in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) own despite that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) was squeezed into something called a Readership of phonetics there.
<p/>The future of phonetics rests probably with his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) pupils, who all swore by him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>); but nothing could bring the man himself into any sort of compliance with the university, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nevertheless clung by divine right in an intensely Oxonian way.
<p/>I daresay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) papers, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has left any, include some satires that may be published without too destructive results fifty years hence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, I believe, not in the least an ill-natured man: very much the opposite, I should say; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not suffer fools gladly.
<p/>Those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will recognize in my third act the allusion to the patent Shorthand in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to write postcards, and which may be acquired from a four and six-penny manual published by the Clarendon Press.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Tito Pagliardini, another phonetic veteran, were men whom it was impossible to dislike. The postcards which Mrs. Higgins describes are such as I have received from Sweet.
<p/>I would decipher a sound which a cockney would represent by zerr, and a Frenchman by seu, and then write demanding with some heat what on earth it meant.
<p/>Sweet, with boundless contempt for my stupidity, would reply that it not only meant but obviously was the word Result, as no other Word containing that sound, and capable of making sense with the context, existed in any language spoken on earth.
<p/>Therefore, though the whole point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Current Shorthand''  (<font color='red'><b>the ones u</b></font>)</div>is that it can express every sound in the language perfectly, vowels as well as consonants, and that your hand has to make no stroke except the easy and current ones with which you write m, n, and u, l, p, and q, scribbling them at whatever angle comes easiest to you, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) unfortunate determination to make this remarkable and quite legible script serve also as a Shorthand reduced it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) own practice to the most inscrutable of cryptograms.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) true objective was the provision of a full, accurate, legible script for our noble but ill-dressed language; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) was led past that by his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) contempt for the popular Pitman system of Shorthand, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) called the Pitfall system.
<p/>The triumph of Pitman was a triumph of business organization: there was a weekly paper to persuade you to learn Pitman: there were cheap textbooks and exercise books and transcripts of speeches for you to copy, and schools where experienced teachers coached you up to the necessary proficiency.
<p/>That less expert mortals should require fuller indications was beyond Sweet's patience. Sweet could not organize his (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) market in that fashion.
<p/>The four and six-penny manual, mostly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) lithographed handwriting, that was never vulgarly advertized, may perhaps some day be taken up by a syndicate and pushed upon the public as The Times pushed the Encyclopaedia Britannica; but until then it will certainly not prevail against Pitman.
<p/>I have bought three copies of it during my lifetime; and I am informed by the publishers that its cloistered existence is still a steady and healthy one.
<p/>I actually learned the system two several times; and yet the shorthand in which I am writing these lines is Pitman's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) might as well have been the Sybil who tore up the leaves of prophecy that nobody would attend to. And the reason is, that my secretary cannot transcribe Sweet, having been perforce taught in the schools of Pitman.
<p/>Therefore, Sweet railed at Pitman as vainly as Thersites railed at Ajax: his (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) raillery, however it may have eased his (<font color='blue'><b>Pitman</b></font>) soul, gave no popular vogue to Current Shorthand.
<p/>Pygmalion Higgins is not a portrait of Sweet, to whom the adventure of Eliza Doolittle would have been impossible; still, as will be seen, there are touches of Sweet in the play.
<p/>As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) impressed himself professionally on Europe to an extent that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) comparative personal obscurity, and the failure of Oxford to do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) eminence, a puzzle to foreign specialists in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) subject.
<p/>I do not blame Oxford, because I think Oxford is quite right in demanding a certain social amenity from its nurslings -LRB-heaven knows it is not exorbitant in its requirements!-RRB-
<p/>; for although I well know how hard it is for a man of genius with a seriously underrated subject to maintain serene and kindly relations with the men who underrate it, and who keep all the best places for less important subjects which they profess without originality and sometimes without much capacity for them, still, if he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) overwhelms them with wrath and disdain, he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) cannot expect them to heap honors on him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>).
<p/>With Higgins's physique and temperament Sweet might have set the Thames on fire. Of the later generations of phoneticians I know little.
<p/>Among them towers the Poet Laureate, to whom perhaps Higgins may owe his (<font color='blue'><b>Poet</b></font>) Miltonic sympathies, though here again I must disclaim all portraiture.
<p/>But if the play makes the public aware that there are such people as phoneticians, and that they are among the most important people in England at present, it will serve its turn.
<p/>I wish to boast that Pygmalion has been an extremely successful play all over Europe and North America as well as at home.
<p/>It is so intensely and deliberately didactic, and its subject is esteemed so dry, that I delight in throwing it at the heads of the wiseacres who repeat the parrot cry that art should never be didactic.
<p/>Finally, and for the encouragement of people troubled with accents that cut them off from all high employment, I may add that the change wrought by Professor Higgins in the flower girl is neither impossible nor uncommon.
<p/>The modern concierge's daughter who fulfils her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ambition by playing the Queen of Spain in Ruy Blas at the Theatre Francais is only one of many thousands of men and women who have sloughed off their native dialects and acquired a new tongue.
<p/>But the thing has to be done scientifically, or the last state of the aspirant may be worse than the first.
<p/>An honest and natural slum dialect is more tolerable than the attempt of a phonetically untaught person to imitate the vulgar dialect of the golf club; and I am sorry to say that in spite of the efforts of our Academy of Dramatic Art, there is still too much sham golfing English on our stage, and too little of the noble English of Forbes Robertson.
<p/>It goes to prove my contention that art should never be anything else. ACT I Covent Garden at 11.15 p.m. Torrents of heavy summer rain.
<p/>Pedestrians running for shelter into the market and under the portico of St. Paul's Church, where there are already several people, among them a lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter in evening dress.
<p/>They are all peering out gloomily at the rain, except one man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back turned to the rest, who seems wholly preoccupied The church clock strikes the first quarter.
<p/>Cab whistles blowing frantically in all directions. THE DAUGHTER -LSB-in the space between the central pillars, close to the one on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left-RSB-
<p/>I'm getting chilled to the bone. What can Freddy be doing all this time? He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)'s been gone twenty minutes. THE MOTHER -LSB-on her (<font color='blue'><b>MOTHER</b></font>) daughter's right-RSB-
<p/>Not so long. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) ought to have got us a cab by this. A BYSTANDER -LSB-on the lady's right-RSB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) won't get no cab not until half-past
<p/>eleven, missus, when they come back after dropping their theatre fares. THE MOTHER. But we must have a cab. We can't stand here until half-past eleven.
<p/>It's too bad. THE BYSTANDER. Well, it ain't my fault, missus. THE DAUGHTER. If Freddy had a bit of gumption, he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) would have got one at the theatre door.
<p/>THE MOTHER. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) have done, poor boy? THE DAUGHTER. Other people got cabs. Why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)? Freddy rushes in out of the rain from the Southampton Street side, and comes between them closing a dripping umbrella.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) is a young man of twenty, in evening dress, very wet around the ankles. THE DAUGHTER. Well, haven't you got a cab?
<p/>FREDDY. There's not one to be had for love or money. THE MOTHER. Oh, Freddy, there must be one. You can't have tried.
<p/>THE DAUGHTER. It's too tiresome. Do you expect us to go and get one ourselves? FREDDY. I tell you they're all engaged.
<p/>The rain was so sudden: nobody was prepared; and everybody had to take a cab. I've been to Charing Cross one way and nearly to Ludgate Circus the other; and they were all engaged.
<p/>THE MOTHER. Did you try Trafalgar Square? FREDDY. There wasn't one at Trafalgar Square. THE DAUGHTER. Did you try? FREDDY. I tried as far as Charing Cross Station.
<p/>Did you expect me to walk to Hammersmith? THE DAUGHTER. You haven't tried at all. THE MOTHER. You really are very helpless, Freddy.
<p/>Go again; and don't come back until you have found a cab. FREDDY. I shall simply get soaked for nothing. THE DAUGHTER.
<p/>And what about us? Are we to stay here all night in this draught, with next to nothing on. You selfish pig-- FREDDY.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>FREDDY</b></font>) opens his (<font color='blue'><b>FREDDY</b></font>) umbrella and dashes off Strandwards, but comes into collision with a flower girl, who is hurrying in for shelter, knocking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) basket out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Oh, very well: I'll go, I'll go. A blinding flash of lightning, followed instantly by a rattling peal of thunder, orchestrates the incident-RSB- THE FLOWER GIRL.
<p/>Nah then, Freddy: look wh' y' gowin, deah. FREDDY. Sorry -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>FREDDY</b></font>) rushes off-RSB-. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-picking up her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) scattered flowers and replacing them in the basket-RSB-
<p/>There's menners f' yer! Te-oo banches o voylets trod into the mad. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) sits down on the plinth of the column, sorting her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) flowers, on the lady's right.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) wears a little sailor hat of black straw that has long been exposed to the dust and soot of London and has seldom if ever been brushed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) is not at all an attractive person. She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) is perhaps eighteen, perhaps twenty, hardly older. Her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) hair needs washing rather badly: its mousy color can hardly be natural.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) wears a shoddy black coat that reaches nearly to her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) knees and is shaped to her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) waist. She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) has a brown skirt with a coarse apron.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) is no doubt as clean as she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) can afford to be; but compared to the ladies she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) is very dirty.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) features are no worse than theirs; but their condition leaves something to be desired; and she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) needs the services of a dentist-RSB-. THE MOTHER.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>MOTHER</b></font>) boots are much the worse for wear. How do you know that my son's name is Freddy, pray? THE FLOWER GIRL.
<p/>Wal, fewd dan y' de-ooty bawmz a mather should, eed now bettern to spawl a pore gel's flahrzn than ran awy atbaht pyin.
<p/>-LSB-Here, with apologies, this desperate attempt to represent her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) dialect without a phonetic alphabet must be abandoned as unintelligible outside London.-RSB-
<p/>Ow, eez ye-ooa san, is e? Will ye-oo py me f`them? THE DAUGHTER. Do nothing of the sort, mother. The idea!
<p/>THE MOTHER. Please allow me, Clara. Have you any pennies? THE DAUGHTER. No. I've nothing smaller than sixpence. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-hopefully-RSB-
<p/>I can give you change for a tanner, kind lady. THE MOTHER -LSB-to Clara-RSB- Give it to me. -LSB-Clara parts reluctantly-RSB-. Now -LSB-to the girl-RSB-
<p/>This is for your flowers. THE FLOWER GIRL. Thank you kindly, lady. THE DAUGHTER. Make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) give you the change. These things are only a penny a bunch.
<p/>THE MOTHER. Do hold your tongue, Clara. -LSB-To the girl-RSB-. You can keep the change. THE FLOWER GIRL. Oh, thank you, lady.
<p/>THE MOTHER. Now tell me how you know that young gentleman's name. THE FLOWER GIRL. I didn't. THE MOTHER. I heard you call him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) by it.
<p/>I called him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Freddy or Charlie same as you might yourself if you was talking to a stranger and wished to be pleasant.
<p/>Don't try to deceive me. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-protesting-RSB- Who's trying to deceive you? -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) sits down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) basket-RSB-. THE DAUGHTER.
<p/>Sixpence thrown away! Really, mamma, you might have spared Freddy that. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) retreats in disgust behind the pillar-RSB-. An elderly gentleman of the amiable military type rushes into shelter, and closes a dripping umbrella.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is in the same plight as Freddy, very wet about the ankles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) is in evening dress, with a light overcoat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) takes the place left vacant by the daughter's retirement. THE GENTLEMAN. Phew! THE MOTHER -LSB-to the gentleman-RSB- Oh, sir, is there any sign of its stopping?
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) goes to the plinth beside the flower girl; puts up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) foot on it; and stoops to turn down his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) trouser ends-RSB-. THE MOTHER.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>MOTHER</b></font>) retires sadly and joins her (<font color='blue'><b>MOTHER</b></font>) daughter-RSB-. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-taking advantage of the military gentleman's proximity to establish friendly relations with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)-RSB-. If it's worse
<p/>THE GENTLEMAN. I'm afraid not. It started worse than ever about two minutes ago. Oh, dear! it's a sign it's nearly over.
<p/>So cheer up, Captain; and buy a flower off a poor girl. THE GENTLEMAN. I'm sorry, I haven't any change. THE FLOWER GIRL.
<p/>I can give you change, Captain, THE GENTLEMEN. For a sovereign? I've nothing less. THE FLOWER GIRL. Garn! Oh do buy a flower off me, Captain.
<p/>I can change half-a-crown. Take this for tuppence. THE GENTLEMAN. Now don't be troublesome: there's a good girl. -LSB-Trying his (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) pockets-RSB- I really haven't any change
<p/>--Stop: here's three hapence, if that's any use to you -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) retreats to the other pillar-RSB-. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-disappointed, but thinking three halfpence better than nothing-RSB- Thank you, sir.
<p/>THE BYSTANDER -LSB-to the girl-RSB- You be careful: give him (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) a flower for it. There's a bloke here behind taking down every blessed word you're saying.
<p/>-LSB-All turn to the man who is taking notes-RSB-. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-springing up terrified-RSB- I ain't done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman.
<p/>-LSB-Hysterically-RSB- I'm a respectable girl: so help me, I never spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) except to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to buy a flower off me.
<p/>I've a right to sell flowers if I keep off the kerb. -LSB-General hubbub, mostly sympathetic to the flower girl, but deprecating her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) excessive sensibility.
<p/>Cries of Don't start hollerin. Who's hurting you? Nobody's going to touch you. What's the good of fussing? Steady on. Easy, easy, etc., come from the elderly staid spectators, who pat her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comfortingly.
<p/>A remoter group, not knowing what the matter is, crowd in and increase the noise with question and answer: What's the row?
<p/>Less patient ones bid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, or ask her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) roughly what is wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). What she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) do? Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?
<p/>A tec taking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) down. What! him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? Yes: him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) over there : Took money off the gentleman, etc.. The flower girl, distraught and mobbed, breaks through them to the gentleman, crying mildly-RSB-
<p/>Oh, sir, don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) charge me. You dunno what it means to me. They'll take away my character and drive me on the streets for speaking to gentlemen.
<p/>They-- THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-coming forward on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) right, the rest crowding after him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)-RSB- There, there, there, there! Who's hurting you, you silly girl?
<p/>What do you take me for? THE BYSTANDER. It's all right : he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)'s a gentleman: look at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) boots. -LSB-Explaining to the note taker-RSB- She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought you was a copper's nark, sir.
<p/>THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-with quick interest-RSB- What's a copper's nark? THE BYSTANDER -LSB-inept at definition-RSB- It's a-- well, it's a copper's nark, as you might say.
<p/>What else would you call it? A sort of informer. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-still hysterical-RSB- I take my Bible oath I never said a word-- THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-overbearing but good-humored-RSB-
<p/>Oh, shut up, shut up. Do I look like a policeman? THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-far from reassured-RSB- Then what did you take down my words for?
<p/>-LSB-The note taker opens his (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) book and holds it steadily under her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) nose, though the pressure of the mob trying to read it over his (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) shoulders would upset a weaker man-RSB-.
<p/>How do I know whether you took me down right? You just show me what you've wrote about me. What's that?
<p/>That ain't proper writing. I can't read that. THE NOTE TAKER. I can. -LSB-Reads, reproducing her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) pronunciation exactly-RSB- '' Cheer ap, Keptin; n' haw
<p/>ya flahr orf a pore gel. '' THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-much distressed-RSB- It's because I called him (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) Captain. I meant no harm.
<p/>-LSB-To the gentleman-RSB- Oh, sir, don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lay a charge agen me for a word like that. You-- THE GENTLEMAN.
<p/>-LSB-To the note taker-RSB- Really, sir, if you are a detective, you need not begin protecting me against molestation by young women until I ask you.
<p/>Charge! I make no charge. Anybody could see that the girl meant no harm. THE BYSTANDERS GENERALLY -LSB-demonstrating against police espionage
<p/>-RSB- Course they could. What business is it of yours? You mind your own affairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) wants promotion, he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) does. Taking down people's words!
<p/>Girl never said a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>). What harm if she (<font color='blue'><b>Girl</b></font>) did? Nice thing a girl can't shelter from the rain without being insulted, etc., etc., etc.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is conducted by the more sympathetic demonstrators back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) plinth, where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) resumes her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seat and struggles with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) emotion-RSB-. THE BYSTANDER.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) ain't a tec. He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>)'s a blooming busybody: that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) is. I tell you, look at his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) boots. THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) genially-RSB-
<p/>And how are all your people down at Selsey? THE BYSTANDER -LSB-suspiciously-RSB- Who told you my people come from Selsey? THE NOTE TAKER.
<p/>Never you mind. They did. -LSB-To the girl-RSB- How do you come to be up so far east? You were born in Lisson Grove.
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-appalled-RSB- Oh, what harm is there in my leaving Lisson Grove? It wasn't fit for a pig to live in; and I had to pay four-and-six a week.
<p/>-LSB-In tears-RSB- Oh, boo--hoo--oo-- THE NOTE TAKER. Live where you like; but stop that noise. THE GENTLEMAN -LSB-to the girl-RSB- Come, come!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) can't touch you: you have a right to live where you please. A SARCASTIC BYSTANDER -LSB-thrusting himself between the note taker and the gentleman-RSB-
<p/>Park Lane, for instance. I'd like to go into the Housing Question with you, I would. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-subsiding into a brooding melancholy over her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) basket, and talking very low-spiritedly to herself-RSB-
<p/>I'm a good girl, I am. THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER -LSB-not attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)-RSB- Do you know where I come from? THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-promptly-RSB- Hoxton.
<p/>Titterings. Popular interest in the note taker's performance increases. THE SARCASTIC ONE -LSB-amazed-RSB- Well, who said I didn't? Bly me! You know everything, you do.
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-still nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) sense of injury-RSB- Ain't no call to meddle with me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bly</b></font>) ain't. THE BYSTANDER -LSB-to her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>)-RSB-
<p/>-LSB-To the note taker-RSB- See here: what call have you to know about people what never offered to meddle with you?
<p/>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) ain't. Don't you stand it from him (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>). Where's your warrant? SEVERAL BYSTANDERS -LSB-encouraged by this seeming point of law-RSB-
<p/>Yes: where's your warrant? THE FLOWER GIRL. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) say what he (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) likes. I don't want to have no truck with him (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>).
<p/>THE BYSTANDER. You take us for dirt under your feet, don't you? Catch you taking liberties with a gentleman! THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER.
<p/>Yes: tell HIM where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) come from if you want to go fortune-telling. THE NOTE TAKER. Cheltenham, Harrow, Cambridge, and India.
<p/>THE GENTLEMAN. Quite right. -LSB-Great laughter. Reaction in the note taker's favor. Exclamations of He (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) knows all about it. Told him (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) proper.
<p/>Hear him (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) tell the toff where he (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) come from? etc.-RSB-. May I ask, sir, do you do this for your living at a music hall?
<p/>THE NOTE TAKER. I've thought of that. Perhaps I shall some day. The rain has stopped; and the persons on the outside of the crowd begin to drop off.
<p/>THE DAUGHTER -LSB-out of patience, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) way rudely to the front and displacing the gentleman, who politely retires to the other side of the pillar-RSB-
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-resenting the reaction-RSB- He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s no gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ain't, to interfere with a poor girl. What on earth is Freddy doing?
<p/>I shall get pneumonia if I stay in this draught any longer. THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-to himself, hastily making a note of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pronunciation of <div class="bookquote">``monia'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RSB-
<p/>Earlscourt. THE DAUGHTER -LSB-violently-RSB- Will you please keep your impertinent remarks to yourself? THE NOTE TAKER. Did I say that out loud?
<p/>I didn't mean to. I beg your pardon. Your mother's Epsom, unmistakeably. THE MOTHER -LSB-advancing between her (<font color='blue'><b>MOTHER</b></font>) daughter and the note taker-RSB- How very curious!
<p/>I was brought up in Largelady Park, near Epsom. THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-uproariously amused-RSB- Ha! ha! What a devil of a name!
<p/>Excuse me. -LSB-To the daughter-RSB- You want a cab, do you? THE DAUGHTER. Don't dare speak to me. THE MOTHER. Oh, please, please Clara.
<p/>-LSB-Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) daughter repudiates her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with an angry shrug and retires haughtily.-RSB- We should be so grateful to you, sir, if you found us a cab.
<p/>-LSB-The note taker produces a whistle-RSB-. Oh, thank you. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) joins her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) daughter-RSB-. The note taker blows a piercing blast. THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER.
<p/>There! I knowed he (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>) was a plain-clothes copper. THE BYSTANDER. That ain't a police whistle: that's a sporting whistle. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-still preoccupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) wounded feelings-RSB-
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>taker</b></font>)'s no right to take away my character. My character is the same to me as any lady's. THE NOTE TAKER.
<p/>I don't know whether you've noticed it; but the rain stopped about two minutes ago. THE BYSTANDER. So it has. Why didn't you say so before?
<p/>and us losing our time listening to your silliness. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) walks off towards the Strand-RSB-. THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER. I can tell where you come from.
<p/>You come from Anwell. Go back there. THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-helpfully-RSB- H anwell. THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER -LSB-affecting great distinction of speech-RSB-
<p/>Thenk you, teacher. Haw haw! So long -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Haw</b></font>) touches his (<font color='blue'><b>Haw</b></font>) hat with mock respect and strolls off-RSB-. THE FLOWER GIRL. Frightening people like that!
<p/>How would he (<font color='blue'><b>Haw</b></font>) like it himself. THE MOTHER. It's quite fine now, Clara. We can walk to a motor bus. Come.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) gathers her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) skirts above her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ankles and hurries off towards the Strand-RSB-. THE DAUGHTER. But the cab---LSB-her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mother is out of hearing-RSB-. Oh, how tiresome!
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) follows angrily-RSB-. All the rest have gone except the note taker, the gentleman, and the flower girl, who sits arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) basket, and still pitying herself in murmurs.
<p/>THE GENTLEMAN -LSB-returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) former place on the note taker's left-RSB- How do you do it, if I may ask?
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL. Poor girl! Hard enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to live without being worrited and chivied. THE NOTE TAKER. Simply phonetics.
<p/>The science of speech. That's my profession; also my hobby. Happy is the man who can make a living by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hobby!
<p/>You can spot an Irishman or a Yorkshireman by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brogue. I can place any man within six miles. I can place him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) within two miles in London.
<p/>Sometimes within two streets. THE FLOWER GIRL. Ought to be ashamed of himself, unmanly coward! THE GENTLEMAN. But is there a living in that?
<p/>THE NOTE TAKER. Oh yes. Quite a fat one. This is an age of upstarts. Men begin in Kentish Town with 80 pounds a year, and end in Park Lane with a hundred thousand.
<p/>They want to drop Kentish Town; but they give themselves away every time they open their mouths. Now I can teach them-- THE FLOWER GIRL.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) mind his (<font color='blue'><b>GENTLEMAN</b></font>) own business and leave a poor girl-- THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-explosively-RSB- Woman: cease this detestable boohooing instantly; or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship.
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-with feeble defiance-RSB- I've a right to be here if I like, same as you. THE NOTE TAKER.
<p/>Remember that you are a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate speech: that your native language is the language of Shakespear and Milton and The Bible; and don't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon.
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-quite overwhelmed, and looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) in mingled wonder and deprecation without daring to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) head-RSB-
<p/>A woman who utters such depressing and disgusting sounds has no right to be anywhere--no right to live. Ah--ah--ah--ow--ow--oo! THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-whipping out his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) book-RSB- Heavens!
<p/>what a sound! -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) writes; then holds out the book and reads, reproducing her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) vowels exactly-RSB- Ah--ah--ah--ow--ow--ow--oo! THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-tickled by the performance, and laughing in spite of herself-RSB-
<p/>You see this creature with her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) kerbstone English: the English that will keep her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) in the gutter to the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) days.
<p/>Garn! THE NOTE TAKER. Well, sir, in three months I could pass that girl off as a duchess at an ambassador's garden party.
<p/>I could even get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a place as lady's maid or shop assistant, which requires better English. That's the sort of thing I do for commercial millionaires.
<p/>And on the profits of it I do genuine scientific work in phonetics, and a little as a poet on Miltonic lines.
<p/>THE GENTLEMAN. I am myself a student of Indian dialects; and-- THE NOTE TAKER -LSB-eagerly-RSB- Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering, the author of Spoken Sanscrit?
<p/>THE GENTLEMAN. I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you? THE NOTE TAKER. Henry Higgins, author of Higgins's Universal Alphabet. PICKERING -LSB-with enthusiasm-RSB-
<p/>I came from India to meet you. HIGGINS. I was going to India to meet you. PICKERING. Where do you live?
<p/>HIGGINS. 27A Wimpole Street. Come and see me tomorrow. PICKERING. I'm at the Carlton. Come with me now and let's have a jaw over some supper.
<p/>HIGGINS. Right you are. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-to Pickering, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) passes her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>)-RSB- Buy a flower, kind gentleman. I'm short for my lodging.
<p/>PICKERING. I really haven't any change. I'm sorry -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) goes away-RSB-. HIGGINS -LSB-shocked at girl's mendacity-RSB- Liar. You said you could change half-a-crown.
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-rising in desperation-RSB- You ought to be stuffed with nails, you ought. -LSB-Flinging the basket at his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) feet-RSB- Take the whole blooming basket for sixpence.
<p/>The church clock strikes the second quarter. HIGGINS -LSB-hearing in it the voice of God, rebuking him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Pharisaic want of charity to the poor girl-RSB-
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) raises his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hat solemnly; then throws a handful of money into the basket and follows Pickering-RSB-. THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-picking up a half-crown-RSB-
<p/>A reminder. Ah--ow--ooh! -LSB-Picking up a couple of florins-RSB- Aaah--ow--ooh! -LSB-Picking up several coins-RSB- Aaaaaah--ow--ooh! -LSB-Picking up a half-sovereign-RSB- Aasaaaaaaaaah --ow--ooh!!!
<p/>FREDDY -LSB-springing out of a taxicab-RSB- Got one at last. Hallo! -LSB-To the girl-RSB- Where are the two ladies that were here?
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL. They walked to the bus when the rain stopped. FREDDY. And left me with a cab on my hands.
<p/>Damnation! THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-with grandeur-RSB- Never you mind, young man. I'm going home in a taxi. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) sails off to the cab.
<p/>The driver puts his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) hand behind him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) and holds the door firmly shut against her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>). Quite understanding his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) mistrust, she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) shows him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) handful of money-RSB-. Eightpence ain't no object to me, Charlie.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) grins and opens the door-RSB-. Angel Court, Drury Lane, round the corner of Micklejohn's oil shop. Let's see how fast you can make her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) hop it.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) gets in and pulls the door to with a slam as the taxicab starts-RSB-. FREDDY. Well, I'm dashed! ACT II
<p/>Next day at 11 a.m. Higgins's laboratory in Wimpole Street. It is a room on the first floor, looking on the street, and was meant for the drawing-room.
<p/>The double doors are in the middle of the back hall; and persons entering find in the corner to their right two tall file cabinets at right angles to one another against the walls.
<p/>In this corner stands a flat writing-table, on which are a phonograph, a laryngoscope, a row of tiny organ pipes with a bellows, a set of lamp chimneys for singing flames with burners attached to a gas plug in the wall by an indiarubber tube, several tuning-forks of different sizes, a life-size image of half a human head, showing in section the vocal organs, and a box containing a supply of wax cylinders for the phonograph.
<p/>Further down the room, on the same side, is a fireplace, with a comfortable leather-covered easy-chair at the side of the hearth nearest the door, and a coal-scuttle.
<p/>There is a clock on the mantelpiece. Between the fireplace and the phonograph table is a stand for newspapers. On the other side of the central door, to the left of the visitor, is a cabinet of shallow drawers.
<p/>The corner beyond, and most of the side wall, is occupied by a grand piano, with the keyboard at the end furthest from the door, and a bench for the player extending the full length of the keyboard.
<p/>On it is a telephone and the telephone directory. On the piano is a dessert dish heaped with fruit and sweets, mostly chocolates.
<p/>The middle of the room is clear. Besides the easy chair, the piano bench, and two chairs at the phonograph table, there is one stray chair.
<p/>It stands near the fireplace. On the walls, engravings; mostly Piranesis and mezzotint portraits. No paintings. Pickering is seated at the table, putting down some cards and a tuning-fork which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) has been using.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) appears in the morning light as a robust, vital, appetizing sort of man of forty or thereabouts, dressed in a professional-looking black frock-coat with a white linen collar and black silk tie.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is of the energetic, scientific type, heartily, even violently interested in everything that can be studied as a scientific subject, and careless about himself and other people, including their feelings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, in fact, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) years and size, rather like a very impetuous baby <div class="bookquote">``taking notice''  (<font color='red'><b>a baby</b></font>)</div>eagerly and loudly, and requiring almost as much watching to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of unintended mischief.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner varies from genial bullying when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in a good humor to stormy petulance when anything goes wrong; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is so entirely frank and void of malice that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remains likeable even in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) least reasonable moments.
<p/>Higgins is standing up near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), closing two or three file drawers which are hanging out. HIGGINS -LSB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shuts the last drawer-RSB-
<p/>Well, I think that's the whole show. PICKERING. It's really amazing. I haven't taken half of it in, you know. HIGGINS.
<p/>Would you like to go over any of it again? PICKERING -LSB-rising and coming to the fireplace, where he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) plants himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) back to the fire-RSB-
<p/>No, thank you; not now. I'm quite done up for this morning. HIGGINS -LSB-following him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>), and standing beside him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) left-RSB-
<p/>Tired of listening to sounds? PICKERING. Yes. It's a fearful strain. I rather fancied myself because I can pronounce twenty-four distinct vowel sounds; but your hundred and thirty beat me.
<p/>I can't hear a bit of difference between most of them. HIGGINS -LSB-chuckling, and going over to the piano to eat sweets-RSB-
<p/>You hear no difference at first; but you keep on listening, and presently you find they're all as different as A from B.
<p/>Oh, that comes with practice. -LSB-Mrs. Pearce looks in: she (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) is Higgins's housekeeper-RSB- What's the matter? MRS. PEARCE -LSB-hesitating, evidently perplexed-RSB- A young woman wants to see you, sir.
<p/>HIGGINS. A young woman! What does she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) want? MRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) says you'll be glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) when you know what she (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>)'s come about.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>)'s quite a common girl, sir. Very common indeed. I should have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) away, only I thought perhaps you wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) to talk into your machines.
<p/>I hope I've not done wrong; but really you see such queer people sometimes --you'll excuse me, I'm sure, sir-- HIGGINS.
<p/>Oh, that's all right, Mrs. Pearce. Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) an interesting accent? MRS. PEARCE. Oh, something dreadful, sir, really. I don't know how you can take an interest in it.
<p/>Show her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) up, Mrs. Pearce -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) rushes across to his (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) working table and picks out a cylinder to use on the phonograph-RSB-. MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-to Pickering-RSB- Let's have her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) up. PEARCE -LSB-only half resigned to it-RSB- Very well, sir. It's for you to say.
<p/>We'll set her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) talking; and I'll take it down first in Bell's visible Speech; then in broad Romic; and then we'll get her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) on the phonograph so that you can turn her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) on as often as you like with the written transcript before you.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) goes downstairs-RSB-. HIGGINS. This is rather a bit of luck. I'll show you how I make records. MRS. PEARCE -LSB-returning-RSB-
<p/>This is the young woman, sir. The flower girl enters in state. She (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) has a hat with three ostrich feathers, orange, sky-blue, and red.
<p/>The pathos of this deplorable figure, with its innocent vanity and consequential air, touches Pickering, who has already straightened himself in the presence of Mrs. Pearce.
<p/>But as to Higgins, the only distinction he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) makes between men and women is that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) is neither bullying nor exclaiming to the heavens against some featherweight cross, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) coaxes women as a child coaxes its nurse when it wants to get anything out of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) has a nearly clean apron, and the shoddy coat has been tidied a little. HIGGINS -LSB-brusquely, recognizing her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) with unconcealed disappointment, and at once, baby-like, making an intolerable grievance of it-RSB-
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s no use: I've got all the records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo; and I'm not going to waste another cylinder on it.
<p/>Why, this is the girl I jotted down last night. -LSB-To the girl-RSB- Be off with you: I don't want you.
<p/>-LSB-To Mrs. Pearce, who is waiting at the door for further instruction-RSB- Did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) I come in a taxi?
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL. Don't you be so saucy. You ain't heard what I come for yet. MRS. PEARCE. Nonsense, girl! what do you think a gentleman like Mr. Higgins cares what you came in?
<p/>Well, I ain't come here to ask for any compliment; and if my money's not good enough I can go elsewhere.
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL. Oh, we are proud! He (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) ain't above giving lessons, not him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) : I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) say so. HIGGINS.
<p/>Good enough for what? THE FLOWER GIRL. Good enough for ye --oo. Now you know, don't you? I'm come to have lessons, I am.
<p/>And to pay for em too: make no mistake. HIGGINS -LSB-stupent-RSB- WELL!!! -LSB-Recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) breath with a gasp-RSB- What do you expect me to say to you?
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL. Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, I think. Don't I tell you I'm bringing you business?
<p/>HIGGINS. Pickering: shall we ask this baggage to sit down or shall we throw her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) out of the window? THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-running away in terror to the piano, where she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) turns at bay-RSB-
<p/>Ah--ah--ah--ow--ow--ow--oo! -LSB-Wounded and whimpering-RSB- I won't be called a baggage when I've offered to pay like any lady. Motionless, the two men stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from the other side of the room, amazed.
<p/>PICKERING -LSB-gently-RSB- What is it you want, my girl? THE FLOWER GIRL. I want to be a lady in a flower shop stead of selling at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.
<p/>But they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel. He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) could teach me. Well, here I am ready to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>)--not asking any favor--and he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) treats me as if I was dirt.
<p/>MRS. PEARCE. How can you be such a foolish ignorant girl as to think you could afford to pay Mr. Higgins?
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL. Why shouldn't I? I know what lessons cost as well as you do; and I'm ready to pay.
<p/>I thought you'd come off it when you saw a chance of getting back a bit of what you chucked at me last night.
<p/>HIGGINS. How much? THE FLOWER GIRL -LSB-coming back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>), triumphant-RSB- Now you're talking! -LSB-Confidentially-RSB- You'd had a drop in, hadn't you?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-peremptorily-RSB- Sit down. THE FLOWER GIRL. Oh, if you're going to make a compliment of it-- HIGGINS -LSB-thundering at her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>)-RSB-
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) places the stray chair near the hearthrug between Higgins and Pickering, and stands behind it waiting for the girl to sit down-RSB-.
<p/>Sit down. MRS. PEARCE -LSB-severely-RSB- Sit down, girl. Do as you're told. THE FLOWER GIRL. Ah--ah--ah--ow--ow--oo! -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) stands, half rebellious, half bewildered-RSB-. PICKERING -LSB-very courteous-RSB-
<p/>Won't you sit down? LIZA -LSB-coyly-RSB- Don't mind if I do. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) sits down. Pickering returns to the hearthrug-RSB-. HIGGINS. What's your name?
<p/>THE FLOWER GIRL. Liza Doolittle. HIGGINS -LSB-declaiming gravely-RSB- Eliza, Elizabeth, Betsy and Bess, They went to the woods to get a bird's nes': PICKERING.
<p/>They found a nest with four eggs in it: HIGGINS. They took one apiece, and left three in it. They laugh heartily at their own wit.
<p/>LIZA. Oh, don't be silly. MRS. PEARCE. You mustn't speak to the gentleman like that. LIZA. Well, why won't he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) speak sensible to me?
<p/>HIGGINS. Come back to business. How much do you propose to pay me for the lessons? LIZA. Oh, I know what's right.
<p/>Well, you wouldn't have the face to ask me the same for teaching me my own language as you would for French; so I won't give more than a shilling.
<p/>A lady friend of mine gets French lessons for eighteenpence an hour from a real French gentleman. Take it or leave it.
<p/>You know, Pickering, if you consider a shilling, not as a simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girl's income, it works out as fully equivalent to sixty or seventy guineas from a millionaire.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-walking up and down the room, rattling his (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) keys and his (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) cash in his (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) pockets-RSB- PICKERING. How so? HIGGINS. Figure it out.
<p/>A millionaire has about 150 pounds a day. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) earns about half-a-crown. LIZA -LSB-haughtily-RSB- Who told you I only-- HIGGINS -LSB-continuing-RSB-
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) offers me two-fifths of her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) day's income for a lesson. Two-fifths of a millionaire's income for a day would be somewhere about 60 pounds.
<p/>It's handsome. By George, it's enormous! it's the biggest offer I ever had. LIZA -LSB-rising, terrified-RSB- Sixty pounds! What are you talking about?
<p/>I never offered you sixty pounds. Where would I get-- HIGGINS. Hold your tongue. LIZA -LSB-weeping-RSB- But I ain't got sixty pounds.
<p/>Oh-- MRS. PEARCE. Don't cry, you silly girl. Sit down. Nobody is going to touch your money. HIGGINS. Somebody is going to touch you, with a broomstick, if you don't stop snivelling.
<p/>Sit down. LIZA -LSB-obeying slowly-RSB- Ah--ah--ah-- ow--oo--o! One would think you was my father. HIGGINS. If I decide to teach you, I'll be worse than two fathers to you.
<p/>Here -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) offers her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) silk handkerchief-RSB-! LIZA. What's this for? HIGGINS. To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part of your face that feels moist.
<p/>Remember: that's your handkerchief; and that's your sleeve. Don't mistake the one for the other if you wish to become a lady in a shop.
<p/>Liza, utterly bewildered, stares helplessly at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). MRS. PEARCE. It's no use talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) like that, Mr. Higgins: she (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) doesn't understand you.
<p/>Besides, you're quite wrong: she (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) doesn't do it that way at all -LSB-she (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) takes the handkerchief-RSB-. LIZA -LSB-snatching it-RSB- Here! You give me that handkerchief.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) give it to me, not to you. PICKERING -LSB-laughing-RSB- He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) did. I think it must be regarded as her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) property, Mrs. Pearce.
<p/>MRS. PEARCE -LSB-resigning herself-RSB- Serve you right, Mr. Higgins. PICKERING. Higgins: I'm interested. What about the ambassador's garden party? I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you make that good.
<p/>I'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment you can't do it. And I'll pay for the lessons. LIZA. Oh, you are real good.
<p/>Thank you, Captain. HIGGINS -LSB-tempted, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB- It's almost irresistible. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s so deliciously low--so horribly dirty-- LIZA -LSB-protesting extremely-RSB- Ah--ah--ah--ah--ow--ow--oooo!!!
<p/>I ain't dirty: I washed my face and hands afore I come, I did. PICKERING. You're certainly not going to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) head with flattery, Higgins.
<p/>Oh, don't say that, sir: there's more ways than one of turning a girl's head; and nobody can do it better than Mr. Higgins, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) may not always mean it.
<p/>MRS. PEARCE -LSB-uneasy-RSB- I do hope , sir, you won't encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) to do anything foolish. HIGGINS -LSB-becoming excited as the idea grows on him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>)-RSB- What is life but a series of inspired follies?
<p/>The difficulty is to find them to do. Never lose a chance: it doesn't come every day. I shall make a duchess of this draggletailed guttersnipe.
<p/>Yes: in six months--in three if she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) has a good ear and a quick tongue--I'll take her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) anywhere and pass her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) off as anything.
<p/>LIZA -LSB-strongly deprecating this view of her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>)-RSB- Ah--ah--ah--ow--ow--oo! HIGGINS -LSB-carried away-RSB- We'll start today: now! this moment! Take her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) away and clean her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), Mrs. Pearce.
<p/>Monkey Brand, if it won't come off any other way. Is there a good fire in the kitchen? MRS. PEARCE -LSB-protesting-RSB-. Yes;
<p/>but-- HIGGINS -LSB-storming on-RSB- Take all her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) clothes off and burn them. Ring up Whiteley or somebody for new ones. Wrap her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) up in brown paper till they come.
<p/>LIZA. You're no gentleman, you're not, to talk of such things. I'm a good girl, I am; and I know what the like of you are, I do.
<p/>HIGGINS. We want none of your Lisson Grove prudery here, young woman. You've got to learn to behave like a duchess.
<p/>Take her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) away, Mrs. Pearce. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) gives you any trouble wallop her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>). LIZA -LSB-springing up and running between Pickering and Mrs. Pearce for protection-RSB-
<p/>No! I'll call the police , I will. MRS. PEARCE. But I've no place to put her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>). HIGGINS. Put her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) in the dustbin.
<p/>LIZA. Ah--ah--ah-- ow--ow--oo! PICKERING. Oh come, Higgins! be reasonable. MRS. PEARCE -LSB-resolutely-RSB- You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins: really you must.
<p/>You can't walk over everybody like this. Higgins, thus scolded, subsides. The hurricane is succeeded by a zephyr of amiable surprise.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-with professional exquisiteness of modulation-RSB- I walk over everybody! My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering, I never had the slightest intention of walking over anyone.
<p/>All I propose is that we should be kind to this poor girl. We must help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to prepare and fit herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) new station in life.
<p/>If I did not express myself clearly it was because I did not wish to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) delicacy, or yours. Liza, reassured, steals back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) chair.
<p/>MRS. PEARCE -LSB-to Pickering-RSB- Well, did you ever hear anything like that, sir? PICKERING -LSB-laughing heartily-RSB- Never, Mrs. Pearce: never. HIGGINS -LSB-patiently-RSB-
<p/>Well, the matter is, sir, that you can't take a girl up like that as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.
<p/>What's the matter? MRS. PEARCE. HIGGINS. Why not? MRS. PEARCE. Why not! But you don't know anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>). What about her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) parents?
<p/>Don't you know that a woman of that class looks a worn out drudge of fifty a year after she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s married.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be married. LIZA. Garn! HIGGINS. There! As the girl very properly says, Garn! Married indeed! LIZA. Who'd marry me?
<p/>By George, Eliza, the streets will be strewn with the bodies of men shooting themselves for your sake before I've done with you.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-suddenly resorting to the most thrillingly beautiful low tones in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) best elocutionary style-RSB- MRS. PEARCE. Nonsense, sir. You mustn't talk like that to her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>).
<p/>LIZA -LSB-rising and squaring herself determinedly-RSB- I'm going away. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s off his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chump, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is. I don't want no balmies teaching me.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-wounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tenderest point by her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) insensibility to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) elocution-RSB- Oh, indeed! I'm mad, am I? Very well, Mrs. Pearce: you needn't order the new clothes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>).
<p/>Throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) out. LIZA -LSB-whimpering-RSB- Nah--ow. You got no right to touch me. MRS. PEARCE. You see now what comes of being saucy.
<p/>-LSB-Indicating the door-RSB- This way, please. LIZA -LSB-almost in tears-RSB- I didn't want no clothes. I wouldn't have taken them -LSB-she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) throws away the handkerchief-RSB-.
<p/>I can buy my own clothes. HIGGINS -LSB-deftly retrieving the handkerchief and intercepting her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) reluctant way to the door-RSB-
<p/>This is my return for offering to take you out of the gutter and dress you beautifully and make a lady of you.
<p/>You're an ungrateful wicked girl. MRS. PEARCE. Stop, Mr. Higgins. I won't allow it. It's you that are wicked. Go home to your parents, girl; and tell them to take better care of you.
<p/>LIZA. I ain't got no parents. They told me I was big enough to earn my own living and turned me out.
<p/>MRS. PEARCE. Where's your mother? LIZA. I ain't got no mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) that turned me out was my sixth stepmother. But I done without them.
<p/>And I'm a good girl, I am. HIGGINS. Very well, then, what on earth is all this fuss about? The girl doesn't belong to anybody--is no use to anybody but me.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) goes to Mrs. Pearce and begins coaxing-RSB-. You can adopt her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>), Mrs. Pearce: I'm sure a daughter would be a great amusement to you.
<p/>Now don't make any more fuss. Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) downstairs; and-- MRS. PEARCE. But what's to become of her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>)? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) to be paid anything?
<p/>Do be sensible, sir. HIGGINS. Oh, pay her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) whatever is necessary: put it down in the housekeeping book. -LSB-Impatiently-RSB- What on earth will she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) want with money?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'ll have her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) food and her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) clothes. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'ll only drink if you give her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) money. LIZA -LSB-turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB- Oh you are a brute.
<p/>It's a lie: nobody ever saw the sign of liquor on me. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) goes back to her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) chair and plants herself there defiantly-RSB-. PICKERING -LSB-in good-humored remonstrance-RSB-
<p/>Does it occur to you, Higgins, that the girl has some feelings? HIGGINS -LSB-looking critically at her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>)-RSB- Oh no, I don't think so.
<p/>Not any feelings that we need bother about. -LSB-Cheerily-RSB- Have you, Eliza? LIZA. I got my feelings same as anyone else.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-to Pickering, reflectively-RSB- You see the difficulty? PICKERING. Eh? What difficulty? HIGGINS. To get her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) to talk grammar. The mere pronunciation is easy enough.
<p/>LIZA. I don't want to talk grammar. I want to talk like a lady. MRS. PEARCE. Will you please keep to the point, Mr. Higgins.
<p/>I want to know on what terms the girl is to be here. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to have any wages? And what is to become of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when you've finished your teaching?
<p/>You must look ahead a little. HIGGINS -LSB-impatiently-RSB- What's to become of her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) if I leave her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) in the gutter? Tell me that, Mrs. Pearce.
<p/>Well, when I've done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>), we can throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) back into the gutter; and then it will be her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) own business again; so
<p/>MRS. PEARCE. That's her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) own business, not yours, Mr. Higgins. HIGGINS. that's all right. LIZA. Oh, you've no feeling heart in you: you don't care for nothing but yourself
<p/>-LSB-she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) rises and takes the floor resolutely-RSB-. Here! I've had enough of this. I'm going -LSB-making for the door-RSB-. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you ought.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-snatching a chocolate cream from the piano, his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) eyes suddenly beginning to twinkle with mischief-RSB- Have some chocolates, Eliza. LIZA -LSB-halting, tempted-RSB-
<p/>Higgins whips out his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) penknife; cuts a chocolate in two; puts one half into his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) mouth and bolts it; and offers her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) the other half.
<p/>How do I know what might be in them? I've heard of girls being drugged by the like of you. HIGGINS.
<p/>-LSB-Liza opens her (<font color='blue'><b>Liza</b></font>) mouth to retort: he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) pops the half chocolate into it-RSB-. You shall have boxes of them, barrels of them, every day.
<p/>Pledge of good faith, Eliza. I eat one half you eat the other. You shall live on them. Eh? LIZA -LSB-who has disposed of the chocolate after being nearly choked by it-RSB-
<p/>I wouldn't have ate it, only I'm too ladylike to take it out of my mouth. HIGGINS. Listen, Eliza. I think you said you came in a taxi.
<p/>LIZA. Well, what if I did? I've as good a right to take a taxi as anyone else. HIGGINS. You have, Eliza; and in future you shall have as many taxis as you want.
<p/>You shall go up and down and round the town in a taxi every day. Think of that, Eliza. MRS. PEARCE.
<p/>Mr. Higgins: you're tempting the girl. It's not right. She (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) should think of the future. HIGGINS. At her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) age! Nonsense! Time enough to think of the future when you haven't any future to think of.
<p/>No, Eliza: do as this lady does: think of other people's futures; but never think of your own. Think of chocolates, and taxis, and gold, and diamonds.
<p/>LIZA. No: I don't want no gold and no diamonds. I'm a good girl, I am. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sits down again, with an attempt at dignity-RSB-. HIGGINS.
<p/>And you shall marry an officer in the Guards, with a beautiful moustache: the son of a marquis, who will disinherit him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) for marrying you, but will relent when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sees your beauty and goodness-- PICKERING.
<p/>You shall remain so, Eliza, under the care of Mrs. Pearce. Excuse me, Higgins; but I really must interfere. Mrs. Pearce is quite right.
<p/>If this girl is to put herself in your hands for six months for an experiment in teaching, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) must understand thoroughly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>)'s doing.
<p/>HIGGINS. How can she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s incapable of understanding anything. Besides, do any of us understand what we are doing? If we did, would we ever do it?
<p/>PICKERING. Very clever, Higgins; but not sound sense. -LSB-To Eliza-RSB- Miss Doolittle-- LIZA -LSB-overwhelmed-RSB- Ah--ah--ow--oo! HIGGINS. There! That's all you get out of Eliza.
<p/>Ah--ah--ow--oo! No use explaining. As a military man you ought to know that. Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) orders: that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) wants.
<p/>Eliza: you are to live here for the next six months, learning how to speak beautifully, like a lady in a florist's shop.
<p/>If you're good and do whatever you're told, you shall sleep in a proper bedroom, and have lots to eat, and money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.
<p/>If you're naughty and idle you will sleep in the back kitchen among the black beetles, and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce with a broomstick.
<p/>If the King finds out you're not a lady, you will be taken by the police to the Tower of London, where your head will be cut off as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls.
<p/>If you are not found out, you shall have a present of seven-and-sixpence to start life with as a lady in a shop.
<p/>If you refuse this offer you will be a most ungrateful and wicked girl; and the angels will weep for you.
<p/>At the end of six months you shall go to Buckingham Palace in a carriage, beautifully dressed. -LSB-To Pickering-RSB- Now are you satisfied, Pickering?
<p/>-LSB-To Mrs. Pearce-RSB- Can I put it more plainly and fairly, Mrs. Pearce? MRS. PEARCE -LSB-patiently-RSB- I think you'd better let me speak to the girl properly in private.
<p/>Of course I know you don't mean her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) any harm; but when you get what you call interested in people's accents, you never think or care what may happen to them or you.
<p/>I don't know that I can take charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) or consent to the arrangement at all. Come with me, Eliza.
<p/>HIGGINS. That's all right. Thank you, Mrs. Pearce. Bundle her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) off to the bath-room. LIZA -LSB-rising reluctantly and suspiciously-RSB- You're a great bully, you are.
<p/>I won't stay here if I don't like. I won't let nobody wallop me. I never asked to go to Bucknam Palace, I didn't.
<p/>I was never in trouble with the police, not me. I'm a good girl-- MRS. PEARCE. Don't answer back, girl. You don't understand the gentleman.
<p/>Come with me. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) leads the way to the door, and holds it open for Eliza-RSB-. LIZA -LSB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) goes out-RSB-
<p/>Well, what I say is right. I won't go near the king, not if I'm going to have my head cut off.
<p/>I always been a good girl; and I never offered to say a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>); and I don't owe him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) nothing; and I don't care; and I won't be put upon; and I have my feelings the same as anyone else-- Mrs. Pearce shuts the door; and Eliza's plaints are no longer audible.
<p/>If I'd known what I was letting myself in for, I wouldn't have come here. Pickering comes from the hearth to the chair and sits astride it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) arms on the back.
<p/>PICKERING. Excuse the straight question, Higgins. Are you a man of good character where women are concerned? HIGGINS -LSB-moodily-RSB- Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?
<p/>PICKERING. Yes: very frequently. HIGGINS -LSB-dogmatically, lifting himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) hands to the level of the piano, and sitting on it with a bounce-RSB-
<p/>I find that the moment I let a woman make friends with me, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) becomes jealous, exacting, suspicious, and a damned nuisance.
<p/>Well, I haven't. I find that the moment I let myself make friends with a woman, I become selfish and tyrannical.
<p/>Women upset everything. When you let them into your life, you find that the woman is driving at one thing and you're driving at another.
<p/>I suppose the woman wants to live her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own life; and the man wants to live his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and each tries to drag the other on to the wrong track.
<p/>One wants to go north and the other south; and the result is that both have to go east, though they both hate the east wind.
<p/>PICKERING. At what, for example? HIGGINS -LSB-coming off the piano restlessly-RSB- Oh, Lord knows! -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sits down on the bench at the keyboard-RSB-.
<p/>So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor, and likely to remain so. PICKERING -LSB-rising and standing over him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) gravely-RSB- Come, Higgins!
<p/>You know what I mean. If I'm to be in this business I shall feel responsible for that girl. I hope it's understood that no advantage is to be taken of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) position.
<p/>HIGGINS. What! That thing! Sacred, I assure you. -LSB-Rising to explain-RSB- You see, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll be a pupil; and teaching would be impossible unless pupils were sacred.
<p/>I've taught scores of American millionairesses how to speak English: the best looking women in the world. I'm seasoned. They might as well be blocks of wood.
<p/>I might as well be a block of wood. It's-- Mrs. Pearce opens the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) has Eliza's hat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Pickering retires to the easy-chair at the hearth and sits down. HIGGINS -LSB-eagerly-RSB- Well, Mrs. Pearce: is it all right? MRS.
<p/>PEARCE -LSB-at the door-RSB- I just wish to trouble you with a word, if I may, Mr. Higgins. HIGGINS. Yes, certainly.
<p/>Come in. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) comes forward-RSB-. Don't burn that, Mrs. Pearce. I'll keep it as a curiosity. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) takes the hat-RSB-. MRS.
<p/>I had to promise her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) not to burn it; but I had better put it in the oven for a while.
<p/>PEARCE. Handle it carefully, sir, please. HIGGINS -LSB-putting it down hastily on the piano-RSB- Oh! thank you. Well, what have you to say to me?
<p/>PICKERING. Am I in the way? MRS. PEARCE. Not at all, sir. Mr. Higgins: will you please be very particular what you say before the girl?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-sternly-RSB- Of course. I'm always particular about what I say. Why do you say this to me? MRS. PEARCE -LSB-unmoved-RSB-
<p/>No, sir: you're not at all particular when you've mislaid anything or when you get a little impatient. Now it doesn't matter before me: I'm used to it.
<p/>But you really must not swear before the girl. HIGGINS -LSB-indignantly-RSB- I swear! -LSB-Most emphatically-RSB- I never swear. I detest the habit.
<p/>What the devil do you mean? MRS. PEARCE -LSB-stolidly-RSB- That's what I mean, sir. You swear a great deal too much.
<p/>I don't mind your damning and blasting, and what the devil and where the devil and who the devil-- HIGGINS. Really!
<p/>Mrs. Pearce: this language from your lips! MRS. PEARCE -LSB-not to be put off-RSB---but there is a certain word I must ask you not to use.
<p/>The girl has just used it herself because the bath was too hot. It begins with the same letter as bath.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knows no better: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) learnt it at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's knee. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must not hear it from your lips. HIGGINS
<p/>-LSB-loftily-RSB- I cannot charge myself with having ever uttered it, Mrs. Pearce. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) steadfastly. He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) adds, hiding an uneasy conscience with a judicial air-RSB-
<p/>Except perhaps in a moment of extreme and justifiable excitement. MRS. PEARCE. Only this morning, sir, you applied it to your boots, to the butter, and to the brown bread.
<p/>HIGGINS. Oh, that! Mere alliteration, Mrs. Pearce, natural to a poet. MRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, whatever you choose to call it, I beg you not to let the girl hear you repeat it.
<p/>HIGGINS. Oh, very well, very well. Is that all? MRS. PEARCE. No, sir. We shall have to be very particular with this girl as to personal cleanliness.
<p/>HIGGINS. Certainly. Quite right. Most important. MRS. PEARCE. I mean not to be slovenly about her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) dress or untidy in leaving things about.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-going to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) solemnly-RSB- Just so. I intended to call your attention to that -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) passes on to Pickering, who is enjoying the conversation
<p/>Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves is as true of personal habits as of money.
<p/>immensely-RSB-. It is these little things that matter, Pickering. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) comes to anchor on the hearthrug, with the air of a man in an unassailable position-RSB-. MRS.
<p/>Then might I ask you not to come down to breakfast in your dressing-gown, or at any rate not to use it as a napkin to the extent you do, sir.
<p/>And if you would be so good as not to eat everything off the same plate, and to remember not to put the porridge saucepan out of your hand on the clean tablecloth, it would be a better example to the girl.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-routed from the hearthrug and drifting back to the piano-RSB- I may do these things sometimes in absence of mind; but surely I don't do them habitually.
<p/>PEARCE. Yes, sir. You know you nearly choked yourself with a fishbone in the jam only last week. -LSB-Angrily-RSB- By the way: my dressing-gown smells most damnably of benzine.
<p/>MRS. PEARCE. No doubt it does, Mr. Higgins. But if you will wipe your fingers-- HIGGINS -LSB-yelling-RSB- Oh very well, very well: I'll wipe them in my hair in future.
<p/>MRS. PEARCE. I hope you're not offended, Mr. Higgins. HIGGINS -LSB-shocked at finding himself thought capable of an unamiable sentiment-RSB- Not at all, not at all.
<p/>You're quite right, Mrs. Pearce: I shall be particularly careful before the girl. Is that all? MRS. PEARCE. No, sir. Might she (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) use some of those Japanese dresses you brought from abroad?
<p/>I really can't put her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) back into her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) old things. HIGGINS. Certainly. Anything you like. Is that all? MRS. PEARCE. Thank you, sir.
<p/>That's all. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) goes out-RSB-. HIGGINS. You know, Pickering, that woman has the most extraordinary ideas about me. Here I am, a shy, diffident sort of man.
<p/>I've never been able to feel really grown-up and tremendous, like other chaps. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s firmly persuaded that I'm an arbitrary overbearing bossing kind of person.
<p/>I can't account for it. Mrs. Pearce returns. MRS. PEARCE. If you please, sir, the trouble's beginning already. There's a dustman downstairs, Alfred Doolittle, wants to see you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) says you have his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) daughter here. PICKERING -LSB-rising-RSB- Phew! I say! -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) retreats to the hearthrug-RSB-. HIGGINS -LSB-promptly-RSB- Send the blackguard up.
<p/>MRS. PEARCE. Oh, very well, sir. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) goes out-RSB-. PICKERING. He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) may not be a blackguard, Higgins. HIGGINS. Nonsense. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>)'s a blackguard.
<p/>PICKERING. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) is or not, I'm afraid we shall have some trouble with him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>). HIGGINS -LSB-confidently-RSB- Oh no: I think not.
<p/>If there's any trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) shall have it with me, not I with him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>). And we are sure to get something interesting out of him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>).
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) admits Doolittle and retires-RSB-. Alfred Doolittle is an elderly but vigorous dustman, clad in the costume of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) profession, including a hat with a back brim covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) neck and shoulders.
<p/>PICKERING. About the girl? HIGGINS. No. I mean his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) dialect. PICKERING. Oh! MRS. PEARCE -LSB-at the door-RSB- Doolittle, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) has well marked and rather interesting features, and seems equally free from fear and conscience.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) has a remarkably expressive voice, the result of a habit of giving vent to his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) feelings without reserve. His (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) present pose is that of wounded honor and stern resolution.
<p/>DOOLITTLE -LSB-at the door, uncertain which of the two gentlemen is his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) man-RSB- Professor Higgins? HIGGINS. Here. Good morning. Sit down.
<p/>DOOLITTLE. Morning, Governor. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) sits down magisterially-RSB- I come about a very serious matter, Governor. HIGGINS -LSB-to Pickering-RSB- Brought up in Hounslow.
<p/>Mother Welsh, I should think. -LSB-Doolittle opens his (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) mouth, amazed. Higgins continues-RSB- What do you want, Doolittle? DOOLITTLE -LSB-menacingly-RSB- I want my daughter: that's what I want.
<p/>See? HIGGINS. Of course you do. You're her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) father, aren't you? You don't suppose anyone else wants her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), do you? I'm glad to see you have some spark of family feeling left.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s upstairs. Take her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) away at once. DOOLITTLE -LSB-rising, fearfully taken aback-RSB- What! HIGGINS. Take her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) away. Do you suppose I'm going to keep your daughter for you?
<p/>DOOLITTLE -LSB-remonstrating-RSB- Now, now, look here, Governor. Is this reasonable? Is it fair to take advantage of a man like this?
<p/>Your daughter had the audacity to come to my house and ask me to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) how to speak properly so that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could get a place in a flower-shop.
<p/>The girl belongs to me. You got her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Where do I come in? -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sits down again-RSB-. HIGGINS. This gentleman and my housekeeper have been here all the time.
<p/>-LSB-Bullying him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)-RSB- How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me? You sent her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) here on purpose. DOOLITTLE -LSB-protesting-RSB- No, Governor.
<p/>HIGGINS. You must have. How else could you possibly know that she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) is here? DOOLITTLE. Don't take a man up like that, Governor.
<p/>HIGGINS. The police shall take you up. This is a plant--a plot to extort money by threats. I shall telephone for the police -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) goes resolutely to the telephone and opens the directory-RSB-. DOOLITTLE.
<p/>Have I asked you for a brass farthing? I leave it to the gentleman here: have I said a word about money?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-throwing the book aside and marching down on Doolittle with a poser-RSB- What else did you come for? DOOLITTLE -LSB-sweetly-RSB-
<p/>Well, what would a man come for? Be human, governor. HIGGINS -LSB-disarmed-RSB- Alfred: did you put her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) up to it? DOOLITTLE.
<p/>So help me, Governor, I never did. I take my Bible oath I ain't seen the girl these two months past.
<p/>HIGGINS. Then how did you know she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) was here? DOOLITTLE -LSB-<div class="bookquote">``most musical, most melancholy'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-RSB- I'll tell you, Governor, if you'll only let me get a word in.
<p/>I'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you. HIGGINS. Pickering: this chap has a certain natural gift of rhetoric.
<p/>Observe the rhythm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) native woodnotes wild. '' I'm willing to tell you: I'm wanting to tell you: I'm waiting to tell you.
<p/>'' Sentimental rhetoric! That's the Welsh strain in him (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>). It also accounts for his (<font color='blue'><b>Welsh</b></font>) mendacity and dishonesty. PICKERING. Oh, PLEASE, Higgins:
<p/>I'm west country myself. -LSB-To Doolittle-RSB- How did you know the girl was here if you didn't send her (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>)? DOOLITTLE. It was like this, Governor.
<p/>The girl took a boy in the taxi to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) a jaunt. Son of her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) landlady, he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) hung about on the chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) another ride home.
<p/>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) back for her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) luggage when she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) heard you was willing for her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) to stop here. I met the boy at the corner of Long Acre and Endell Street.
<p/>HIGGINS. Public house. Yes? DOOLITTLE. The poor man's club, Governor: why shouldn't I? PICKERING. Do let him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) tell his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) story, Higgins.
<p/>DOOLITTLE. He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) told me what was up. And I ask you, what was my feelings and my duty as a father?
<p/>I says to the boy, <div class="bookquote">``You bring me the luggage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>I says-- PICKERING. Why didn't you go for it yourself? DOOLITTLE.
<p/>Landlady wouldn't have trusted me with it, Governor. She (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>)'s that kind of woman: you know. I had to give the boy a penny afore
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trusted me with it, the little swine. I brought it to her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) just to oblige you like, and make myself agreeable.
<p/>That's all. HIGGINS. How much luggage? DOOLITTLE. Musical instrument, Governor. A few pictures, a trifle of jewelry, and a bird-cage. She (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) didn't want no clothes.
<p/>What was I to think from that, Governor? I ask you as a parent what was I to think? HIGGINS. So you came to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) from worse than death, eh?
<p/>DOOLITTLE -LSB-appreciatively: relieved at being understood-RSB- Just so, Governor. That's right. PICKERING. But why did you bring her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) luggage if you intended to take her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) away?
<p/>DOOLITTLE. Have I said a word about taking her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) away? Have I now? HIGGINS -LSB-determinedly-RSB- You're going to take her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) away, double quick.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) crosses to the hearth and rings the bell-RSB-. DOOLITTLE -LSB-rising-RSB- No, Governor. Don't say that. I'm not the man to stand in my girl's light.
<p/>Here's a career opening for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as you might say; and-- Mrs. Pearce opens the door and awaits orders. HIGGINS. Mrs. Pearce: this is Eliza's father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has come to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) away. Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) goes back to the piano, with an air of washing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands of the whole affair-RSB-. DOOLITTLE.
<p/>No. This is a misunderstanding. Listen here-- MRS. PEARCE. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can't take her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) away, Mr. Higgins: how can he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>)? You told me to burn her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) clothes.
<p/>DOOLITTLE. That's right. I can't carry the girl through the streets like a blooming monkey, can I? I put it to you.
<p/>HIGGINS. You have put it to me that you want your daughter. Take your daughter. If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has no clothes go out and buy her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) some.
<p/>DOOLITTLE -LSB-desperate-RSB- Where's the clothes she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) come in? Did I burn them or did your missus here? MRS. PEARCE. I am the housekeeper, if you please.
<p/>I have sent for some clothes for your girl. When they come you can take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) away. You can wait in the kitchen.
<p/>This way, please. Doolittle, much troubled, accompanies her (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) to the door; then hesitates; finally turns confidentially to Higgins. DOOLITTLE. Listen here, Governor.
<p/>You and me is men of the world, ain't we? HIGGINS. Oh! Men of the world, are we? You'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.
<p/>MRS. PEARCE. I think so, indeed, sir. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>) goes, with dignity-RSB-. PICKERING. The floor is yours, Mr. Doolittle. DOOLITTLE -LSB-to Pickering-RSB-
<p/>-LSB-To Higgins, who takes refuge on the piano bench, a little overwhelmed by the proximity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) visitor; for Doolittle has a professional flavor of dust about him (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>)-RSB-.
<p/>Well, the truth is, I've taken a sort of fancy to you, Governor; and if you want the girl, I'm not so set on having her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back home again
<p/>I thank you, Governor. but what I might be open to an arrangement. Regarded in the light of a young woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a fine handsome girl.
<p/>All I ask is my rights as a father; and you're the last man alive to expect me to let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go for nothing
<p/>As a daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s not worth her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) keep; and so I tell you straight. ; for I can see you're one of the straight sort, Governor.
<p/>Well, what's a five pound note to you? And what's Eliza to me? -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) chair and sits down judicially-RSB-. PICKERING.
<p/>I think you ought to know, Doolittle, that Mr. Higgins's intentions are entirely honorable. DOOLITTLE. Course they are, Governor. If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask fifty.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-revolted-RSB- Do you mean to say, you callous rascal, that you would sell your daughter for 50 pounds? DOOLITTLE. Not in a general way I wouldn't; but to oblige a gentleman like you
<p/>I'd do a good deal, I do assure you. PICKERING. Have you no morals, man? DOOLITTLE -LSB-unabashed-RSB- Can't afford them, Governor.
<p/>Neither could you if you was as poor as me. Not that I mean any harm, you know. But if Liza is going to have a bit out of this, why not me too?
<p/>There can be no question that as a matter of morals it's a positive crime to give this chap a farthing.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-troubled-RSB- I don't know what to do, Pickering. And yet I feel a sort of rough justice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) claim.
<p/>DOOLITTLE. That's it, Governor. That's all I say. A father's heart, as it were. PICKERING. Well, I know the feeling; but really it seems hardly right-- DOOLITTLE.
<p/>Don't say that, Governor. Don't look at it that way. What am I, Governors both? I ask you, what am I?
<p/>I'm one of the undeserving poor: that's what I am. Think of what that means to a man. It means that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s up agen middle class morality all the time.
<p/>If there's anything going, and I put in for a bit of it, it's always the same story: <div class="bookquote">``You're undeserving; so you can't have it.
<p/>But my needs is as great as the most deserving widow's that ever got money out of six different charities in one week for the death of the same husband.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I don't need less than a deserving man: I need more. I don't eat less hearty than him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and I drink a lot more.
<p/>I want a bit of amusement, cause I'm a thinking man. I want cheerfulness and a song and a band when I feel low.
<p/>Well, they charge me just the same for everything as they charge the deserving. What is middle class morality? Just an excuse for never giving me anything.
<p/>Therefore, I ask you, as two gentlemen, not to play that game on me. I'm playing straight with you. I ain't pretending to be deserving.
<p/>Will you take advantage of a man's nature to do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the price of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own daughter what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s brought up and fed and clothed by the sweat of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brow until she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s growed big enough to be interesting to you two gentlemen?
<p/>I'm undeserving; and I mean to go on being undeserving. I like it; and that's the truth. Is five pounds unreasonable?
<p/>Pickering: if we were to take this man in hand for three months, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could choose between a seat in the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.
<p/>I put it to you; and I leave it to you. HIGGINS -LSB-rising, and going over to Pickering-RSB- PICKERING. What do you say to that, Doolittle?
<p/>I've heard all the preachers and all the prime ministers--for I'm a thinking man and game for politics or religion or social reform same as all the other amusements--and I tell you it's a dog's life
<p/>DOOLITTLE. Not me, Governor, thank you kindly. anyway you look at it. Undeserving poverty is my line. Taking one station in society with another, it's
<p/>--it's--well, it's the only one that has any ginger in it, to my taste. HIGGINS. I suppose we must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) a fiver.
<p/>PICKERING. He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>)'ll make a bad use of it, I'm afraid. DOOLITTLE. Not me, Governor, so help me I won't. Don't you be afraid that I'll save it and spare it and live idle on it.
<p/>There won't be a penny of it left by Monday: I'll have to go to work same as if I'd never had it.
<p/>Just one good spree for myself and the missus, giving pleasure to ourselves and employment to others, and satisfaction to you to think it's not been throwed away.
<p/>It won't pauperize me, you bet. You couldn't spend it better. HIGGINS -LSB-taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pocket book and coming between Doolittle and the piano-RSB-
<p/>This is irresistible. Let's give him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ten. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) offers two notes to the dustman-RSB-. DOOLITTLE. No, Governor. She (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) wouldn't have the heart to spend ten; and perhaps I shouldn't neither.
<p/>Ten pounds is a lot of money: it makes a man feel prudent like; and then goodbye to happiness. You give me what I ask you,
<p/>Governor: not a penny more, and not a penny less. PICKERING. Why don't you marry that missus of yours? I rather draw the line at encouraging that sort of immorality.
<p/>DOOLITTLE. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) so, Governor: tell her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) so. I'm willing. It's me that suffers by it. I've no hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>).
<p/>I got to be agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>). I got to give her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) presents. I got to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) clothes something sinful.
<p/>I'm a slave to that woman, Governor, just because I'm not her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) lawful husband. And she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) knows it too. Catch her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) marrying me!
<p/>Take my advice, Governor: marry Eliza while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'s young and don't know no better. If you don't you'll be sorry for it after.
<p/>If you do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'ll be sorry for it after; but better you than her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), because you're a man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'s only a woman and don't know how to be happy anyhow.
<p/>HIGGINS. Pickering: if we listen to this man another minute, we shall have no convictions left. -LSB-To Doolittle-RSB- Five pounds I think you said.
<p/>DOOLITTLE. Thank you kindly, Governor. HIGGINS. You're sure you won't take ten? DOOLITTLE. Not now. Another time, Governor. HIGGINS -LSB-handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) a five-pound note-RSB-
<p/>Here you are. DOOLITTLE. Thank you, Governor. Good morning. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) hurries to the door, anxious to get away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) booty.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) opens it he (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) is confronted with a dainty and exquisitely clean young Japanese lady in a simple blue cotton kimono printed cunningly with small white jasmine blossoms.
<p/>Mrs. Pearce is with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) gets out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) way deferentially and apologizes-RSB-. Beg pardon, miss. THE JAPANESE LADY. Garn!
<p/>Don't you know your own daughter? DOOLITTLE -LCB-exclaiming Bly me! it's Eliza! HIGGINS -LCB- simul- What's that! This! PICKERING -LCB-taneously By Jove!
<p/>LIZA. Don't I look silly? HIGGINS. Silly? MRS. PEARCE -LSB-at the door-RSB- Now, Mr. Higgins, please don't say anything to make the girl conceited about herself.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-conscientiously-RSB- Oh! Quite right, Mrs. Pearce. -LSB-To Eliza-RSB- Yes: damned silly. MRS. PEARCE. Please, sir. HIGGINS -LSB-correcting himself-RSB- I mean extremely silly.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) takes up her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) hat; puts it on; and walks across the room to the fireplace with a fashionable air-RSB-. HIGGINS.
<p/>LIZA. I should look all right with my hat on. A new fashion, by George! And it ought to look horrible!
<p/>DOOLITTLE -LSB-with fatherly pride-RSB- Well, I never thought she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>)'d clean up as good looking as that, Governor. She (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>)'s a credit to me, ain't she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>)?
<p/>LIZA. I tell you, it's easy to clean up here. Hot and cold water on tap, just as much as you like, there is.
<p/>Woolly towels, there is; and a towel horse so hot, it burns your fingers. Soft brushes to scrub yourself, and a wooden bowl of soap smelling like primroses.
<p/>Now I know why ladies is so clean. Washing's a treat for them. Wish they saw what it is for the like of me!
<p/>HIGGINS. I'm glad the bath-room met with your approval. LIZA. It didn't: not all of it; and I don't care who hears me say it.
<p/>Mrs. Pearce knows. HIGGINS. What was wrong, Mrs. Pearce? MRS. PEARCE -LSB-blandly-RSB- Oh, nothing, sir. It doesn't matter. LIZA. I had a good mind to break it.
<p/>I didn't know which way to look. But I hung a towel over it, I did. HIGGINS. Over what? MRS. PEARCE.
<p/>Over the looking-glass, sir. HIGGINS. Doolittle: you have brought your daughter up too strictly. DOOLITTLE. Me! I never brought her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) up at all, except to give her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) a lick of a strap now and again.
<p/>Don't put it on me, Governor. She (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) ain't accustomed to it, you see: that's all. But she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>)'ll soon pick up your free-and-easy ways.
<p/>LIZA. I'm a good girl, I am; and I won't pick up no free and easy ways. HIGGINS. Eliza: if you say again that you're a good girl, your father shall take you home.
<p/>LIZA. Not him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). You don't know my father. All he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) come here for was to touch you for some money to get drunk on.
<p/>DOOLITTLE. Well, what else would I want money for? To put into the plate in church, I suppose. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) puts out her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) tongue at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Don't you give me none of your lip; and don't let me hear you giving this gentleman any of it neither, or you'll hear from me about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is so incensed by this that Pickering presently finds it necessary to step between them-RSB-. See? HIGGINS. Have you any further advice to give her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) before you go, Doolittle?
<p/>Your blessing, for instance. DOOLITTLE. No, Governor: I ain't such a mug as to put up my children to all I know myself.
<p/>Hard enough to hold them in without that. If you want Eliza's mind improved, Governor, you do it yourself with a strap.
<p/>So long, gentlemen. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) turns to go-RSB-. HIGGINS -LSB-impressively-RSB- Stop. You'll come regularly to see your daughter. It's your duty, you know.
<p/>My brother is a clergyman; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could help you in your talks with her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). DOOLITTLE -LSB-evasively-RSB- Certainly. I'll come, Governor.
<p/>Not just this week, because I have a job at a distance. But later on you may depend on me. Afternoon, gentlemen.
<p/>Afternoon, ma'am. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) takes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) hat to Mrs. Pearce, who disdains the salutation and goes out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) winks at Higgins, thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>) probably a fellow sufferer from Mrs. Pearce's difficult disposition, and follows her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>)-RSB-. LIZA.
<p/>Don't you believe the old liar. He (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>)'d as soon you set a bull-dog on him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) as a clergyman. You won't see him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) again in a hurry.
<p/>HIGGINS. I don't want to, Eliza. Do you? LIZA. Not me. I don't want never to see him (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) again, I don't.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>)'s a disgrace to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) is, collecting dust, instead of working at his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) trade. PICKERING. What is his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) trade, Eliza?
<p/>LIZA. Talking money out of other people's pockets into his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) own. His (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) proper trade's a navvy; and he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) works at it sometimes too--for exercise--and earns good money at it.
<p/>Ain't you going to call me Miss Doolittle any more? PICKERING. I beg your pardon, Miss Doolittle. It was a slip of the tongue.
<p/>I should just like to take a taxi to the corner of Tottenham Court Road and get out there and tell it to wait for me, just to put the girls in their place a bit.
<p/>LIZA. Oh, I don't mind; only it sounded so genteel. I wouldn't speak to them, you know. PICKERING. Better wait til we get you something really fashionable.
<p/>HIGGINS. Besides, you shouldn't cut your old friends now that you have risen in the world. That's what we call snobbery.
<p/>They've took it out of me often enough with their ridicule when they had the chance; and now I mean to get a bit of my own back.
<p/>LIZA. You don't call the like of them my friends now, I should hope. But if I'm to have fashionable clothes, I'll wait.
<p/>Mrs. Pearce says you're going to give me some to wear in bed at night different to what I wear in the daytime; but it do seem a waste of money when you could get something to show.
<p/>I should like to have some. Besides, I never could fancy changing into cold things on a winter night. MRS. PEARCE -LSB-coming back-RSB-
<p/>Now, Eliza. The new things have come for you to try on. LIZA. Ah--ow--oo--ooh! -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) rushes out-RSB-. MRS. PEARCE -LSB-following her (<font color='blue'><b>PEARCE</b></font>)-RSB-
<p/>Oh, don't rush about like that, girl -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shuts the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)-RSB-. HIGGINS. Pickering: we have taken on a stiff job.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drawing-room, in a flat on Chelsea embankment, has three windows looking on the river; and the ceiling is not so lofty as it would be in an older house of the same pretension.
<p/>PICKERING -LSB-with conviction-RSB- Higgins: we have. ACT III It is Mrs. Higgins's at-home day. Nobody has yet arrived. The windows are open, giving access to a balcony with flowers in pots.
<p/>If you stand with your face to the windows, you have the fireplace on your left and the door in the right-hand wall close to the corner nearest the windows.
<p/>Mrs. Higgins was brought up on Morris and Burne Jones; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) room, which is very unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) son's room in Wimpole Street, is not crowded with furniture and little tables and nicknacks.
<p/>In the middle of the room there is a big ottoman; and this, with the carpet, the Morris wall-papers, and the Morris chintz window curtains and brocade covers of the ottoman and its cushions, supply all the ornament, and are much too handsome to be hidden by odds and ends of useless things.
<p/>A few good oil-paintings from the exhibitions in the Grosvenor Gallery thirty years ago -LRB-the Burne Jones, not the Whistler side of them-RRB- are on the walls.
<p/>There is a portrait of Mrs. Higgins as she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) defied fashion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) youth in one of the beautiful Rossettian costumes which, when caricatured by people who did not understand, led to the absurdities of popular estheticism in the eighteen-seventies.
<p/>In the corner diagonally opposite the door Mrs. Higgins, now over sixty and long past taking the trouble to dress out of the fashion, sits writing at an elegantly simple writing-table with a bell button within reach of her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The only landscape is a Cecil Lawson on the scale of a Rubens. There is a Chippendale chair further back in the room between her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) and the window nearest her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) side.
<p/>At the other side of the room, further forward, is an Elizabethan chair roughly carved in the taste of Inigo Jones.
<p/>On the same side a piano in a decorated case. The corner between the fireplace and the window is occupied by a divan cushioned in Morris chintz.
<p/>It is between four and five in the afternoon. The door is opened violently; and Higgins enters with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hat on.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-dismayed-RSB- Henry -LSB-scolding him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)-RSB-! What are you doing here to-day? It is my at home day: you promised not to come.
<p/>-LSB-As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bends to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hat off, and presents it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)-RSB-. HIGGINS. Oh bother! -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) throws the hat down on the table-RSB-. MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS. Go home at once. HIGGINS -LSB-kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB- I know, mother. I came on purpose. MRS. HIGGINS. But you mustn't. I'm serious, Henry.
<p/>You offend all my friends: they stop coming whenever they meet you. HIGGINS. Nonsense! I know I have no small talk; but people don't mind.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sits on the settee-RSB-. MRS. HIGGINS. Oh! don't they? Small talk indeed! What about your large talk? Really, dear, you mustn't stay.
<p/>I'm sorry; but I can't get round your vowels; and though I like to get pretty postcards in your patent shorthand, I always have to read the copies in ordinary writing you so thoughtfully send me.
<p/>HIGGINS. I must. I've a job for you. A phonetic job. MRS. HIGGINS. No use, dear. HIGGINS. Well, this isn't a phonetic job.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. You said it was. HIGGINS. Not your part of it. I've picked up a girl. MRS. HIGGINS. Does that mean that some girl has picked you up?
<p/>HIGGINS. Not at all. I don't mean a love affair. MRS. HIGGINS. What a pity! HIGGINS. Why? MRS. HIGGINS. Well, you never fall in love with anyone under forty-five.
<p/>When will you discover that there are some rather nice-looking young women about? HIGGINS. Oh, I can't be bothered with young women.
<p/>My idea of a loveable woman is something as like you as possible. I shall never get into the way of seriously liking young women: some habits lie too deep to be changed.
<p/>-LSB-Rising abruptly and walking about, jingling his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) money and his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) keys in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) trouser pockets-RSB- Besides, they're all idiots. MRS. HIGGINS.
<p/>Do you know what you would do if you really loved me, Henry? HIGGINS. Oh bother! What? Marry, I suppose? MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS. No. Stop fidgeting and take your hands out of your pockets. -LSB-With a gesture of despair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) obeys and sits down again-RSB-.
<p/>That's a good boy. Now tell me about the girl. HIGGINS. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s coming to see you. MRS. HIGGINS. I don't remember asking her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>).
<p/>HIGGINS. You didn't. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). If you'd known her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) you wouldn't have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). MRS. HIGGINS. Indeed! Why? HIGGINS. Well, it's like this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s a common flower girl. I picked her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) off the kerbstone. MRS. HIGGINS. And invited her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) to my at-home! HIGGINS -LSB-rising and coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) to coax her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB-
<p/>Oh, that'll be all right. I've taught her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) to speak properly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) has strict orders as to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) behavior. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s to keep to two subjects: the weather and everybody's health--
<p/>Fine day and How do you do, you know--and not to let herself go on things in general. That will be safe.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Safe! To talk about our health! about our insides! perhaps about our outsides! How could you be so silly, Henry?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-impatiently-RSB- Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) must talk about something. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) controls himself and sits down again-RSB-. Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'ll be all right: don't you fuss.
<p/>Pickering is in it with me. I've a sort of bet on that I'll pass her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) off as a duchess in six months.
<p/>I started on her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) some months ago; and she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s getting on like a house on fire. I shall win my bet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) has a quick ear; and she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s been easier to teach than my middle-class pupils because she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s had to learn a complete new language.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) talks English almost as you talk French. MRS. HIGGINS. That's satisfactory, at all events. HIGGINS. Well, it is and it isn't.
<p/>You see, I've got her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) pronunciation all right; but you have to consider not only how a girl pronounces, but what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pronounces; and that's where--
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. What does that mean? HIGGINS. They are interrupted by the parlor-maid, announcing guests. THE PARLOR-MAID. Mrs. and Miss Eynsford Hill.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rises; snatches his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hat from the table; and makes for the door; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reaches it his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother introduces him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)-RSB-. Mrs. and Miss Eynsford Hill are the mother and daughter who sheltered from the rain in Covent Garden.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) withdraws-RSB-. HIGGINS. Oh Lord! The mother is well bred, quiet, and has the habitual anxiety of straitened means. The daughter has acquired a gay air of being very much at home in society: the bravado of genteel poverty.
<p/>MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-to Mrs. Higgins-RSB- How do you do? -LSB-They shake hands-RSB-. MISS EYNSFORD HILL. How d'you do? -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) shakes-RSB-. MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-introducing-RSB- My son Henry. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Your celebrated son! I have so longed to meet you, Professor Higgins. HIGGINS
<p/>-LSB-glumly, making no movement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) direction-RSB- Delighted. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) backs against the piano and bows brusquely-RSB-. Miss EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) with confident familiarity-RSB-
<p/>How do you do? HIGGINS -LSB-staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB- I've seen you before somewhere. I haven't the ghost of a notion where; but I've heard your voice.
<p/>-LSB-Drearily-RSB- It doesn't matter. You'd better sit down. MRS. HIGGINS. I'm sorry to say that my celebrated son has no manners.
<p/>You mustn't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). MISS EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-gaily-RSB- I don't. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) sits in the Elizabethan chair-RSB-. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-a little bewildered-RSB- Not at all.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) sits on the ottoman between her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) daughter and Mrs. Higgins, who has turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) chair away from the writing-table-RSB-. HIGGINS.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) goes to the central window, through which, with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) back to the company, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) contemplates the river and the flowers in Battersea Park on the opposite bank as if they were a frozen dessert.-RSB-
<p/>Oh, have I been rude? I didn't mean to be. The parlor-maid returns, ushering in Pickering. THE PARLOR-MAID. Colonel Pickering -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) withdraws-RSB-. PICKERING.
<p/>How do you do, Mrs. Higgins? MRS. HIGGINS. So glad you've come. Do you know Mrs. Eynsford Hill--Miss Eynsford Hill? -LSB-Exchange of bows.
<p/>The Colonel brings the Chippendale chair a little forward between Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Higgins, and sits down-RSB-. PICKERING. Has Henry told you what we've come for?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-over his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulder-RSB- We were interrupted: damn it! MRS. HIGGINS. Oh Henry, Henry, really! MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-half rising-RSB- Are we in the way?
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-rising and making her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) sit down again-RSB- No, no. You couldn't have come more fortunately: we want you to meet a friend of ours.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-turning hopefully-RSB- Yes, by George! We want two or three people. You'll do as well as anybody else. The parlor-maid returns, ushering Freddy.
<p/>THE PARLOR-MAID. Mr. Eynsford Hill. HIGGINS -LSB-almost audibly, past endurance-RSB- God of Heaven! another of them. FREDDY -LSB-shaking hands with Mrs. Higgins-RSB-
<p/>Ahdedo? MRS. HIGGINS. Very good of you to come. -LSB-Introducing-RSB- Colonel Pickering. FREDDY -LSB-bowing-RSB- Ahdedo? MRS. HIGGINS. I don't think you know my son, Professor Higgins.
<p/>FREDDY -LSB-going to Higgins-RSB- Ahdedo? HIGGINS -LSB-looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) were a pickpocket-RSB- I'll take my oath I've met you before somewhere.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) shakes Freddy's hand, and almost slings him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) on the ottoman with his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) face to the windows; then comes round to the other side of it.
<p/>Where was it? FREDDY. I don't think so. HIGGINS -LSB-resignedly-RSB- It don't matter, anyhow. Sit down. HIGGINS. Well, here we are, anyhow!
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>FREDDY</b></font>) sits down on the ottoman next Mrs. Eynsford Hill, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) left.-RSB- And now, what the devil are we going to talk about until Eliza comes?
<p/>Henry: you are the life and soul of the Royal Society's soirees; but really you're rather trying on more commonplace occasions.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. HIGGINS. Am I? Very sorry. -LSB-Beaming suddenly-RSB- I suppose I am, you know. -LSB-Uproariously-RSB- Ha, ha! MISS EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-who considers Higgins quite eligible matrimonially-RSB-
<p/>I sympathize. I haven't any small talk. If people would only be frank and say what they really think! HIGGINS -LSB-relapsing into gloom-RSB- Lord forbid!
<p/>What they think they ought to think is bad enough, Lord knows; but what they really think would break up the whole show.
<p/>MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) daughter's cue-RSB- But why? HIGGINS. Do you suppose it would be really agreeable if I were to come out now with what I really think?
<p/>MISS EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-gaily-RSB- Is it so very cynical? HIGGINS. Cynical! Who the dickens said it was cynical? I mean it wouldn't be decent.
<p/>MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-seriously-RSB- Oh! I'm sure you don't mean that, Mr. Higgins. HIGGINS. You see, we're all savages, more or less.
<p/>We're supposed to be civilized and cultured--to know all about poetry and philosophy and art and science, and so on; but how many of us know even the meanings of these names?
<p/>-LSB-To Miss Hill-RSB- What do you know of poetry? -LSB-To Mrs. Hill-RSB- What do you know of science? -LSB-Indicating Freddy-RSB- What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) know of art or science or anything else?
<p/>What the devil do you imagine I know of philosophy? MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-warningly-RSB- Or of manners, Henry? THE PARLOR-MAID -LSB-opening the door-RSB-
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stands on tiptoe and makes signs over his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mother's head to Eliza to indicate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) which lady is her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) hostess-RSB-. Eliza, who is exquisitely dressed, produces an impression of such remarkable distinction and beauty as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) enters that they all rise, quite flustered.
<p/>Miss Doolittle. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) withdraws-RSB-. HIGGINS -LSB-rising hastily and running to Mrs. Higgins-RSB- Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) is, mother. Guided by Higgins's signals, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) comes to Mrs. Higgins with studied grace.
<p/>LIZA -LSB-speaking with pedantic correctness of pronunciation and great beauty of tone-RSB- How do you do, Mrs. Higgins? -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) gasps slightly in making sure of the H in Higgins, but is quite successful-RSB-.
<p/>Mr. Higgins told me I might come. MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-cordially-RSB- Quite right: I'm very glad indeed to see you. PICKERING. How do you do, Miss Doolittle?
<p/>LIZA -LSB-shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>)-RSB- Colonel Pickering, is it not? MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. I feel sure we have met before, Miss Doolittle.
<p/>I remember your eyes. LIZA. How do you do? -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) sits down on the ottoman gracefully in the place just left vacant by Higgins-RSB-. MRS.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) sits down on the ottoman beside Eliza, devouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) eyes-RSB-. FREDDY -LSB-coming to their side of the ottoman-RSB-
<p/>EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-introducing-RSB- My daughter Clara. LIZA. How do you do? CLARA -LSB-impulsively-RSB- How do you do? I've certainly had the pleasure.
<p/>MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-introducing-RSB- My son Freddy. LIZA. How do you do? Freddy bows and sits down in the Elizabethan chair, infatuated.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-suddenly-RSB- By George, yes: it all comes back to me! -LSB-They stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)-RSB-. Covent Garden! -LSB-Lamentably-RSB- What a damned thing!
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Henry, please! -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is about to sit on the edge of the table-RSB-. Don't sit on my writing-table: you'll break it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) goes to the divan, stumbling into the fender and over the fire-irons on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) way; extricating himself with muttered imprecations; and finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) disastrous journey by throwing himself so impatiently on the divan that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) almost breaks it.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-sulkily-RSB- Sorry. Mrs. Higgins looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), but controls herself and says nothing. A long and painful pause ensues. MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-at last, conversationally-RSB- Will it rain, do you think? LIZA. The shallow depression in the west of these islands is likely to move slowly in an easterly direction.
<p/>There are no indications of any great change in the barometrical situation. FREDDY. Ha! ha! how awfully funny! LIZA. What is wrong with that, young man?
<p/>I bet I got it right. FREDDY. Killing! MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. I'm sure I hope it won't turn cold. There's so much influenza about.
<p/>It runs right through our whole family regularly every spring. LIZA -LSB-darkly-RSB- My aunt died of influenza: so they said. MRS.
<p/>EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-clicks her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) tongue sympathetically-RSB-!!! LIZA -LSB-in the same tragic tone-RSB- But it's my belief they done the old woman in.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-puzzled-RSB- Done her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) in? LIZA. Y-e-e-e-es, Lord love you! Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) die of influenza? She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) come through diphtheria right enough the year before.
<p/>They all thought she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) was dead; but my father he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kept ladling gin down her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) throat til she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) came to so sudden that she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) bit the bowl off the spoon.
<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) with my own eyes. Fairly blue with it, she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) was. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-startled-RSB- Dear me! LIZA -LSB-piling up the indictment-RSB-
<p/>What call would a woman with that strength in her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) have to die of influenza? What become of her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) new straw hat that should have come to me?
<p/>Somebody pinched it; and what I say is, them as pinched it done her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) in. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. What does doing her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) in mean?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-hastily-RSB- Oh, that's the new small talk. To do a person in means to kill them. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-to Eliza, horrified-RSB-
<p/>You surely don't believe that your aunt was killed? LIZA. Do I not! Them she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) lived with would have killed her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) for a hat-pin, let alone a hat.
<p/>MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. But it can't have been right for your father to pour spirits down her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) throat like that. It might have killed her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>).
<p/>LIZA. Not her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>). Gin was mother's milk to her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>). Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d poured so much down his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own throat that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew the good of it.
<p/>MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Do you mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drank? LIZA. Drank! My word! Something chronic. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. How dreadful for you!
<p/>LIZA. Not a bit. It never did him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) no harm what I could see. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not keep it up regular.
<p/>-LSB-Cheerfully-RSB- On the burst, as you might say, from time to time. And always more agreeable when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a drop in.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was out of work, my mother used to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fourpence and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to go out and not come back until he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d drunk himself cheerful and loving-like.
<p/>There's lots of women has to make their husbands drunk to make them fit to live with. -LSB-Now quite at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ease-RSB- You see, it's like this.
<p/>If a man has a bit of a conscience, it always takes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s sober; and then it makes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) low-spirited.
<p/>A drop of booze just takes that off and makes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happy. -LSB-To Freddy, who is in convulsions of suppressed laughter-RSB-
<p/>Here! what are you sniggering at? FREDDY. The new small talk. You do it so awfully well. LIZA. If I was doing it proper, what was you laughing at?
<p/>-LSB-To Higgins-RSB- Have I said anything I oughtn't? MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-interposing-RSB- Not at all, Miss Doolittle. LIZA. Well, that's a mercy, anyhow.
<p/>-LSB-Expansively-RSB- What I always say is-- HIGGINS -LSB-rising and looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>FREDDY</b></font>) watch-RSB- Ahem! LIZA -LSB-looking round at him (<font color='blue'><b>FREDDY</b></font>); taking the hint; and rising-RSB-
<p/>Well: I must go. -LSB-They all rise. Freddy goes to the door-RSB-. So pleased to have met you. Good-bye. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) shakes hands with Mrs. Higgins-RSB-. MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS. Good-bye. LIZA. Good-bye, Colonel Pickering. PICKERING. Good-bye, Miss Doolittle. -LSB-They shake hands-RSB-. LIZA -LSB-nodding to the others-RSB- Good-bye, all. FREDDY -LSB-opening the door for her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>)-RSB-
<p/>Are you walking across the Park, Miss Doolittle? If so-- LIZA. Walk! Not bloody likely. -LSB-Sensation-RSB-. I am going in a taxi.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) goes out-RSB-. Pickering gasps and sits down. Freddy goes out on the balcony to catch another glimpse of Eliza. MRS.
<p/>EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-suffering from shock-RSB- Well, I really can't get used to the new ways. CLARA -LSB-throwing herself discontentedly into the Elizabethan chair-RSB-. Oh, it's all right, mamma, quite right.
<p/>People will think we never go anywhere or see anybody if you are so old-fashioned. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. I daresay I am very old-fashioned; but I do hope you won't begin using that expression, Clara.
<p/>I have got accustomed to hear you talking about men as rotters, and calling everything filthy and beastly; though I do think it horrible and unladylike.
<p/>I've been away in India for several years; and manners have changed so much that I sometimes don't know whether I'm at a respectable dinner-table or in a ship's forecastle.
<p/>But this last is really too much. Don't you think so, Colonel Pickering? PICKERING. Don't ask me. CLARA. It's all a matter of habit.
<p/>There's no right or wrong in it. Nobody means anything by it. And it's so quaint, and gives such a smart emphasis to things that are not in themselves very witty.
<p/>I find the new small talk delightful and quite innocent. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-rising-RSB- Well, after that, I think it's time for us to go.
<p/>Pickering and Higgins rise. CLARA -LSB-rising-RSB- Oh yes : we have three at homes to go to still. Good-bye, Mrs. Higgins.
<p/>Good-bye, Colonel Pickering. Good-bye, Professor Higgins. HIGGINS -LSB-coming grimly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) from the divan, and accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) to the door-RSB- Good-bye.
<p/>Be sure you try on that small talk at the three at-homes. Don't be nervous about it. Pitch it in strong.
<p/>CLARA -LSB-all smiles-RSB- I will. Good-bye. Such nonsense, all this early Victorian prudery! HIGGINS -LSB-tempting her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB- Such damned nonsense! CLARA. Such bloody nonsense!
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) goes out radiant, conscious of being thoroughly up to date, and is heard descending the stairs in a stream of silvery laughter-RSB-. FREDDY -LSB-to the heavens at large-RSB-
<p/>MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-convulsively-RSB- Clara! CLARA. Ha! ha! Well, I ask you -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) gives it up, and comes to Mrs. Higgins-RSB-. Good-bye.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-shaking hands-RSB- Good-bye. Would you like to meet Miss Doolittle again? FREDDY -LSB-eagerly-RSB- Yes, I should, most awfully. MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS. Well, you know my days. FREDDY. Yes. Thanks awfully. Good-bye. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>FREDDY</b></font>) goes out-RSB-. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Good-bye, Mr. Higgins. HIGGINS.
<p/>Good-bye. Good-bye. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-to Pickering-RSB- It's no use. I shall never be able to bring myself to use that word.
<p/>PICKERING. Don't. It's not compulsory, you know. You'll get on quite well without it. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Only, Clara is so down on me if I am not positively reeking with the latest slang.
<p/>-LSB-Pickering, catching from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lowered tone that this is not meant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) to hear, discreetly joins Higgins at the window-RSB-.
<p/>Good-bye. PICKERING. Good-bye -LSB-They shake hands-RSB-. MRS. EYNSFORD HILL -LSB-to Mrs. Higgins-RSB- You mustn't mind Clara. We're so poor! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) gets so few parties, poor child!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) doesn't quite know. -LSB-Mrs. Higgins, seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) eyes are moist, takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) hand sympathetically and goes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) to the door-RSB-.
<p/>But the boy is nice. Don't you think so? MRS. HIGGINS. Oh, quite nice. I shall always be delighted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>-LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) swoops on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother and drags her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) to the ottoman, where she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) sits down in Eliza's place with her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) son on her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) left-RSB-?
<p/>MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Thank you, dear. Good-bye. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) goes out-RSB-. HIGGINS -LSB-eagerly-RSB- Well? Is Eliza presentable Pickering returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) chair on her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) right.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s a triumph of your art and of her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) dressmaker's; but if you suppose for a moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) doesn't give herself away in every sentence she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) utters, you must be perfectly cracked about her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>).
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. You silly boy, of course she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s not presentable. PICKERING. But don't you think something might be done? I mean something to eliminate the sanguinary element from her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) conversation.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Not as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) is in Henry's hands. HIGGINS -LSB-aggrieved-RSB- Do you mean that my language is improper?
<p/>No, dearest: it would be quite proper--say on a canal barge; but it would not be proper for her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) at a garden party.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. HIGGINS -LSB-deeply injured-RSB- Well I must say-- PICKERING -LSB-interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>)-RSB- Come, Higgins: you must learn to know yourself. I haven't heard such language as yours since we used to review the volunteers in Hyde Park twenty years ago.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-sulkily-RSB- Oh, well, if you say so, I suppose I don't always talk like a bishop. MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-quieting Henry with a touch-RSB-
<p/>Colonel Pickering: will you tell me what is the exact state of things in Wimpole Street? PICKERING -LSB-cheerfully: as if this completely changed the subject-RSB- Well, I have come to live there with Henry.
<p/>We work together at my Indian Dialects; and we think it more convenient-- MRS. HIGGINS. Quite so. I know all about that: it's an excellent arrangement.
<p/>But where does this girl live? HIGGINS. With us, of course. Where would she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) live? MRS. HIGGINS. But on what terms?
<p/>Is she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) a servant? If not, what is she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)? PICKERING -LSB-slowly-RSB- I think I know what you mean, Mrs. Higgins. HIGGINS.
<p/>Well, dash me if I do! I've had to work at the girl every day for months to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) present pitch.
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>)'s useful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) knows where my things are, and remembers my appointments and so forth. MRS. HIGGINS. How does your housekeeper get on with her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)?
<p/>Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s jolly glad to get so much taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) hands; for before Eliza came, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had to have to find things and remind me of my appointments.
<p/>HIGGINS. Mrs. Pearce? But she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s got some silly bee in her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) bonnet about Eliza. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) keeps saying <div class="bookquote">``You don't think, sir'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>: doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), Pick?
<p/>PICKERING. Yes: that's the formula. '' You don't think, sir. '' That's the end of every conversation about Eliza. HIGGINS. As if I ever stop thinking about the girl and her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) confounded vowels and consonants.
<p/>I'm worn out, thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), and watching her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) lips and her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) teeth and her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) tongue, not to mention her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) soul, which is the quaintest of the lot.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. You certainly are a pretty pair of babies, playing with your live doll. HIGGINS. Playing! The hardest job I ever tackled: make no mistake about that, mother.
<p/>But you have no idea how frightfully interesting it is to take a human being and change her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) into a quite different human being by creating a new speech for her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>).
<p/>It's filling up the deepest gulf that separates class from class and soul from soul. PICKERING -LSB-drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) chair closer to Mrs. Higgins and bending over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) eagerly-RSB-
<p/>Yes: it's enormously interesting. I assure you, Mrs. Higgins, we take Eliza very seriously. Every week--every day almost--there is some new change.
<p/>-LSB-Closer again-RSB- We keep records of every stage--dozens of gramophone disks and photographs-- HIGGINS -LSB-assailing her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) at the other ear-RSB- Yes, by George: it's the most absorbing experiment I ever tackled.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) regularly fills our lives up; doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>), Pick? PICKERING. We're always talking Eliza. HIGGINS. Teaching Eliza. PICKERING. Dressing Eliza. MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS. What! HIGGINS. Inventing new Elizas. Higgins and Pickering, speaking together: HIGGINS. You know, she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) has the most extraordinary quickness of ear: PICKERING.
<p/>I assure you, my dear Mrs. Higgins, that girl HIGGINS. just like a parrot. I've tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) with every PICKERING. is a genius.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) can play the piano quite beautifully HIGGINS. possible sort of sound that a human being can make-- PICKERING. We have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) to classical concerts and to music HIGGINS.
<p/>Continental dialects, African dialects, Hottentot PICKERING. halls; and it's all the same to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) : she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) plays everything HIGGINS. clicks, things it took me years to get hold of; and PICKERING.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) hears right off when she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) comes home, whether it's HIGGINS. she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) picks them up like a shot, right away, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) had PICKERING.
<p/>Beethoven and Brahms or Lehar and Lionel Morickton ; HIGGINS. been at it all her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) life. PICKERING. though six months ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'d never as much as touched a piano.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-putting her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) fingers in her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) ears, as they are by this time shouting one another down with an intolerable noise-RSB-
<p/>Sh--sh --sh--sh! -LSB-They stop-RSB-. PICKERING. I beg your pardon. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) draws his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) chair back apologetically-RSB-. HIGGINS. Sorry. When Pickering starts shouting nobody can get a word in edgeways.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Be quiet, Henry. Colonel Pickering: don't you realize that when Eliza walked into Wimpole Street, something walked in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)?
<p/>PICKERING. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) father did. But Henry soon got rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>). MRS. HIGGINS. It would have been more to the point if her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) mother had.
<p/>But as her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) mother didn't something else did. PICKERING. But what? MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-unconsciously dating herself by the word-RSB- A problem.
<p/>PICKERING. Oh, I see. The problem of how to pass her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) off as a lady. HIGGINS. I'll solve that problem. I've half solved it already.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. No, you two infinitely stupid male creatures: the problem of what is to be done with her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) afterwards. HIGGINS.
<p/>I don't see anything in that. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) can go her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) own way, with all the advantages I have given her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). MRS.
<p/>The manners and habits that disqualify a fine lady from earning her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own living without giving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a fine lady's income!
<p/>HIGGINS. The advantages of that poor woman who was here just now! Is that what you mean? PICKERING -LSB-indulgently, being rather bored-RSB-
<p/>Oh, that will be all right, Mrs. Higgins. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) rises to go-RSB-. HIGGINS -LSB-rising also-RSB- We'll find her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) some light employment.
<p/>PICKERING. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s happy enough. Don't you worry about her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). Good-bye. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) shakes hands as if he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) were consoling a frightened child, and makes for the door-RSB-. HIGGINS.
<p/>Anyhow, there's no good bothering now. The thing's done. Good-bye, mother. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), and follows Pickering-RSB-. PICKERING -LSB-turning for a final consolation-RSB-
<p/>There are plenty of openings. We'll do what's right. Good-bye. HIGGINS -LSB-to Pickering as they go out together-RSB- Let's take her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) to the Shakespear exhibition at Earls Court.
<p/>PICKERING. Yes: let's. Her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) remarks will be delicious. HIGGINS. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'ll mimic all the people for us when we get home. PICKERING.
<p/>Ripping. -LSB-Both are heard laughing as they go downstairs-RSB-. MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-rises with an impatient bounce, and returns to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) work at the writing-table.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) sweeps a litter of disarranged papers out of her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) way; snatches a sheet of paper from her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) stationery case; and tries resolutely to write.
<p/>At the third line she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) gives it up; flings down her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) pen; grips the table angrily and exclaims-RSB- Oh, men! men!!
<p/>men!!! ACT IV The Wimpole Street laboratory. Midnight. Nobody in the room. The clock on the mantelpiece strikes twelve. The fire is not alight: it is a summer night.
<p/>Presently Higgins and Pickering are heard on the stairs. HIGGINS -LSB-calling down to Pickering-RSB- I say, Pick: lock up, will you.
<p/>I shan't be going out again. PICKERING. Right. Can Mrs. Pearce go to bed? We don't want anything more, do we?
<p/>Eliza opens the door and is seen on the lighted landing in opera cloak, brilliant evening dress, and diamonds, with fan, flowers, and all accessories.
<p/>HIGGINS. Lord, no! She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) comes to the hearth, and switches on the electric lights there. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) is tired: her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) pallor contrasts strongly with her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) dark eyes and hair; and her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) expression is almost tragic.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) takes off her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) cloak; puts her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) fan and flowers on the piano; and sits down on the bench, brooding and silent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) takes off the hat and overcoat; throws them carelessly on the newspaper stand; disposes of his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) coat in the same way; puts on the smoking jacket; and throws himself wearily into the easy-chair at the hearth.
<p/>Higgins, in evening dress, with overcoat and hat, comes in, carrying a smoking jacket which he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) has picked up downstairs. Pickering, similarly attired, comes in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) also takes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) hat and overcoat, and is about to throw them on Higgins's when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) hesitates. PICKERING. I say: Mrs. Pearce will row if we leave these things lying about in the drawing-room.
<p/>HIGGINS. Oh, chuck them over the bannisters into the hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'ll find them there in the morning and put them away all right.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'ll think we were drunk. PICKERING. We are, slightly. Are there any letters? HIGGINS. I didn't look. -LSB-Pickering takes the overcoats and hats and goes down stairs.
<p/>Higgins begins half singing half yawning an air from La Fanciulla del Golden West. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Golden</b></font>) stops and exclaims-RSB- I wonder where the devil my slippers are!
<p/>Eliza looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) darkly; then leaves the room. Higgins yawns again, and resumes his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) song. Pickering returns, with the contents of the letter-box in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) hand.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) throws the circulars into the fender, and posts himself on the hearthrug, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) back to the grate-RSB-. HIGGINS -LSB-glancing at the billet-doux-RSB- Money-lender.
<p/>PICKERING. Only circulars, and this coroneted billet-doux for you. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) throws the letter after the circulars-RSB-. Eliza returns with a pair of large down-at-heel slippers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) places them on the carpet before Higgins, and sits as before without a word. HIGGINS -LSB-yawning again-RSB- Oh Lord! What an evening!
<p/>What a crew! What a silly tomfoollery! -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) raises his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) shoe to unlace it, and catches sight of the slippers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) stops unlacing and looks at them as if they had appeared there of their own accord-RSB-. Oh!
<p/>they're there, are they? PICKERING -LSB-stretching himself-RSB- Well, I feel a bit tired. It's been a long day. The garden party, a dinner party, and the opera!
<p/>Rather too much of a good thing. But you've won your bet, Higgins. Eliza did the trick, and something to spare, eh?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-fervently-RSB- Thank God it's over! Eliza flinches violently; but they take no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) recovers herself and sits stonily as before.
<p/>PICKERING. Were you nervous at the garden party? I was. Eliza didn't seem a bit nervous. HIGGINS. Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) wasn't nervous.
<p/>I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'d be all right. No, it's the strain of putting the job through all these months that has told on me.
<p/>It was interesting enough at first, while we were at the phonetics; but after that I got deadly sick of it.
<p/>If I hadn't backed myself to do it I should have chucked the whole thing up two months ago. It was a silly notion: the whole thing has been a bore.
<p/>PICKERING. Oh come! the garden party was frightfully exciting. My heart began beating like anything. HIGGINS. Yes, for the first three minutes.
<p/>But when I saw we were going to win hands down, I felt like a bear in a cage, hanging about doing nothing.
<p/>The dinner was worse: sitting gorging there for over an hour, with nobody but a damned fool of a fashionable woman to talk to!
<p/>I tell you, Pickering, never again for me. No more artificial duchesses. The whole thing has been simple purgatory. PICKERING. You've never been broken in properly to the social routine.
<p/>-LSB-Strolling over to the piano-RSB- I rather enjoy dipping into it occasionally myself: it makes me feel young again. Anyhow, it was a great success: an immense success.
<p/>You see, lots of the real people can't do it at all: they're such fools that they think style comes by nature to people in their position; and so they never learn.
<p/>I was quite frightened once or twice because Eliza was doing it so well. There's always something professional about doing a thing superlatively well.
<p/>HIGGINS. Yes: that's what drives me mad: the silly people don't know their own silly business. -LSB-Rising-RSB- However, it's over and done with; and now I can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow.
<p/>Eliza's beauty becomes murderous. PICKERING. I think I shall turn in too. Still, it's been a great occasion: a triumph for you.
<p/>-LSB-Over his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) shoulder, at the door-RSB- Put out the lights, Eliza; and tell Mrs. Pearce not to make coffee for me in the morning: I'll take tea.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) goes out-RSB-. Eliza tries to control herself and feel indifferent as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) rises and walks across to the hearth to switch off the lights.
<p/>Good-night. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) goes-RSB-. HIGGINS -LSB-following him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>)-RSB- Good-night. By the time she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) gets there she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) is on the point of screaming. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) sits down in Higgins's chair and holds on hard to the arms.
<p/>Finally she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) gives way and flings herself furiously on the floor raging. HIGGINS -LSB-in despairing wrath outside-RSB- What the devil have I done with my slippers?
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) appears at the door-RSB-. LIZA -LSB-snatching up the slippers, and hurling them at him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) one after the other with all her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) force-RSB-
<p/>There are your slippers. And there. Take your slippers; and may you never have a day's luck with them! HIGGINS -LSB-astounded-RSB-
<p/>What on earth--! -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB-. What's the matter? Get up. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) pulls her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) up-RSB-. Anything wrong? LIZA -LSB-breathless-RSB- Nothing wrong--with YOU.
<p/>I've won your bet for you, haven't I? That's enough for you. I don't matter, I suppose. HIGGINS. YOU won my bet!
<p/>You! Presumptuous insect! I won it. What did you throw those slippers at me for? LIZA. Because I wanted to smash your face.
<p/>I'd like to kill you, you selfish brute. Why didn't you leave me where you picked me out of--in the gutter?
<p/>You thank God it's all over, and that now you can throw me back again there, do you? -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) crisps her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) fingers, frantically-RSB-. HIGGINS
<p/>-LSB-looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) in cool wonder-RSB- The creature IS nervous, after all. LIZA -LSB-gives a suffocated scream of fury, and instinctively darts her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) nails at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face-RSB-!!
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-catching her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) wrists-RSB- Ah! would you? Claws in, you cat. How dare you show your temper to me? Sit down and be quiet.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) throws her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) roughly into the easy-chair-RSB-. LIZA -LSB-crushed by superior strength and weight-RSB- What's to become of me? What's to become of me?
<p/>HIGGINS. How the devil do I know what's to become of you? What does it matter what becomes of you? LIZA.
<p/>You don't care. I know you don't care. You wouldn't care if I was dead. I'm nothing to you--not so much as them slippers.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-thundering-RSB- THOSE slippers. LIZA -LSB-with bitter submission-RSB- Those slippers. I didn't think it made any difference now. A pause. Eliza hopeless and crushed.
<p/>Higgins a little uneasy. HIGGINS -LSB-in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) loftiest manner-RSB- Why have you begun going on like this? May I ask whether you complain of your treatment here?
<p/>LIZA. No. HIGGINS. Has anybody behaved badly to you? Colonel Pickering? Mrs. Pearce? Any of the servants? LIZA. No. HIGGINS. I presume you don't pretend that I have treated you badly.
<p/>LIZA. No. HIGGINS. I am glad to hear it. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) moderates his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) tone-RSB-. Perhaps you're tired after the strain of the day.
<p/>Will you have a glass of champagne? -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) moves towards the door-RSB-. LIZA. No. -LSB-Recollecting her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) manners-RSB- Thank you. HIGGINS -LSB-good-humored again-RSB-
<p/>This has been coming on you for some days. I suppose it was natural for you to be anxious about the garden party.
<p/>But that's all over now. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) pats her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) kindly on the shoulder. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) writhes-RSB-. There's nothing more to worry about. LIZA.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) suddenly rises and gets away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) by going to the piano bench, where she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) sits and hides her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) face-RSB-. Oh God!
<p/>No. Nothing more for you to worry about. I wish I was dead. HIGGINS -LSB-staring after her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) in sincere surprise-RSB- Why? in heaven's name, why?
<p/>-LSB-Reasonably, going to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB- Listen to me, Eliza. All this irritation is purely subjective. LIZA. I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.
<p/>HIGGINS. It's only imagination. Low spirits and nothing else. Nobody's hurting you. Nothing's wrong. You go to bed like a good girl and sleep it off.
<p/>Have a little cry and say your prayers: that will make you comfortable. LIZA. I heard YOUR prayers. '' Thank God it's all over!''
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-impatiently-RSB- Well, don't you thank God it's all over? Now you are free and can do what you like. LIZA -LSB-pulling herself together in desperation-RSB-
<p/>What am I fit for? What have you left me fit for? Where am I to go? What am I to do?
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pockets, and walks about in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) usual manner, rattling the contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pockets, as if condescending to a trivial subject out of pure kindness-RSB-.
<p/>What's to become of me? HIGGINS -LSB-enlightened, but not at all impressed-RSB- Oh, that's what's worrying you, is it? I shouldn't bother about it if I were you.
<p/>I should imagine you won't have much difficulty in settling yourself, somewhere or other, though I hadn't quite realized that you were going away.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) looks quickly at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), but examines the dessert stand on the piano and decides that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will eat an apple-RSB-. You might marry, you know.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bites a large piece out of the apple, and munches it noisily-RSB-. You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel.
<p/>Most men are the marrying sort -LRB-poor devils!-RRB-; and you're not bad-looking; it's quite a pleasure to look at you sometimes--not now, of course, because you're crying and looking as ugly as the very devil; but when you're all right and quite yourself, you're what I should call attractive.
<p/>You go to bed and have a good nice rest; and then get up and look at yourself in the glass; and you won't feel so cheap.
<p/>That is, to the people in the marrying line, you understand. Eliza again looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), speechless, and does not stir.
<p/>The look is quite lost on him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) eats his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) apple with a dreamy expression of happiness, as it is quite a good one.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-a genial afterthought occurring to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)-RSB- I daresay my mother could find some chap or other who would do very well-- LIZA.
<p/>We were above that at the corner of Tottenham Court Road. HIGGINS -LSB-waking up-RSB- What do you mean? LIZA. I sold flowers.
<p/>I didn't sell myself. Now you've made a lady of me I'm not fit to sell anything else. I wish you'd left me where you found me.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-slinging the core of the apple decisively into the grate-RSB- Tosh, Eliza. Don't you insult human relations by dragging all this cant about buying and selling into it.
<p/>You needn't marry the fellow if you don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). LIZA. What else am I to do? HIGGINS. Oh, lots of things.
<p/>What about your old idea of a florist's shop? Pickering could set you up in one: he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>)'s lots of money. -LSB-Chuckling-RSB-
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>)'ll have to pay for all those togs you have been wearing today; and that, with the hire of the jewellery, will make a big hole in two hundred pounds.
<p/>Why, six months ago you would have thought it the millennium to have a flower shop of your own. Come! you'll be all right.
<p/>I must clear off to bed: I'm devilish sleepy. By the way, I came down for something: I forget what it was.
<p/>LIZA. Your slippers. HIGGINS. Oh yes, of course. You shied them at me. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) picks them up, and is going out when she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) rises and speaks to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)-RSB-. LIZA.
<p/>Before you go, sir-- HIGGINS -LSB-dropping the slippers in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) surprise at her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) calling him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sir-RSB- Eh? LIZA. Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-coming back into the room as if her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) question were the very climax of unreason-RSB- What the devil use would they be to Pickering?
<p/>LIZA. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) might want them for the next girl you pick up to experiment on. HIGGINS -LSB-shocked and hurt-RSB- Is THAT the way you feel towards us?
<p/>LIZA. I don't want to hear anything more about that. All I want to know is whether anything belongs to me.
<p/>My own clothes were burnt. HIGGINS. But what does it matter? Why need you start bothering about that in the middle of the night?
<p/>LIZA. I want to know what I may take away with me. I don't want to be accused of stealing. HIGGINS -LSB-now deeply wounded-RSB- Stealing!
<p/>You shouldn't have said that, Eliza. That shows a want of feeling. LIZA. I'm sorry. I'm only a common ignorant girl; and in my station I have to be careful.
<p/>There can't be any feelings between the like of you and the like of me. Please will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesn't?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-very sulky-RSB- You may take the whole damned houseful if you like. Except the jewels. They're hired. Will that satisfy you?
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) turns on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heel and is about to go in extreme dudgeon-RSB-. LIZA -LSB-drinking in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) emotion like nectar, and nagging him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to provoke a further supply-RSB-
<p/>Stop, please. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) takes off her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) jewels-RSB-. Will you take these to your room and keep them safe? I don't want to run the risk of their being missing.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-furious -RSB- Hand them over. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) puts them into his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hands-RSB-. If these belonged to me instead of to the jeweler, I'd ram them down your ungrateful throat.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) perfunctorily thrusts them into his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pockets, unconsciously decorating himself with the protruding ends of the chains-RSB-. LIZA -LSB-taking a ring off-RSB-
<p/>-LSB-Higgins dashes the ring violently into the fireplace, and turns on her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) so threateningly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) crouches over the piano with her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) face, and exclaims-RSB-
<p/>This ring isn't the jeweler's: it's the one you bought me in Brighton. I don't want it now. Don't you hit me.
<p/>HIGGINS. Hit you! You infamous creature, how dare you accuse me of such a thing? It is you who have hit me.
<p/>You have wounded me to the heart. LIZA -LSB-thrilling with hidden joy-RSB- I'm glad. I've got a little of my own back, anyhow.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-with dignity, in his (<font color='blue'><b>jeweler</b></font>) finest professional style-RSB- You have caused me to lose my temper: a thing that has hardly ever happened to me before.
<p/>I prefer to say nothing more tonight. I am going to bed. LIZA -LSB-pertly-RSB- You'd better leave a note for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee; for she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) won't be told by me.
<p/>Damn Mrs. Pearce; and damn the coffee; and damn you; and damn my own folly in having lavished MY hard-earned knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) goes out with impressive decorum, and spoils it by slamming the door savagely-RSB-. Eliza smiles for the first time; expresses her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) feelings by a wild pantomime in which an imitation of Higgins's exit is confused with her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) own triumph; and finally goes down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) knees on the hearthrug to look for the ring.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-formally-RSB- ACT V Mrs. Higgins's drawing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) is at her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) writing-table as before. The parlor-maid comes in. THE PARLOR-MAID -LSB-at the door-RSB- Mr. Henry, mam, is downstairs with Colonel Pickering.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Well, show them up. THE PARLOR-MAID. They're using the telephone, mam. Telephoning to the police, I think. MRS. HIGGINS.
<p/>What! THE PARLOR-MAID -LSB-coming further in and lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) voice-RSB- Mr. Henry's in a state, mam. I thought I'd better tell you.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. If you had told me that Mr. Henry was not in a state it would have been more surprising.
<p/>Tell them to come up when they've finished with the police. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s lost something. THE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, maam -LSB-going-RSB-. MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS. Go upstairs and tell Miss Doolittle that Mr. Henry and the Colonel are here. Ask her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) not to come down till I send for her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>).
<p/>THE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, mam. Higgins bursts in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is, as the parlor-maid has said, in a state. HIGGINS. Look here, mother: here's a confounded thing!
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Yes, dear. Good-morning. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) checks his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) impatience and kisses her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), whilst the parlor-maid goes out-RSB-. What is it? HIGGINS.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) was left last night, as usual, to turn out the lights and all that; and instead of going to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) clothes and went right off: her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) bed wasn't slept in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) came in a cab for her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) things before seven this morning; and that fool Mrs. Pearce let her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) have them without telling me a word about it.
<p/>Eliza's bolted. MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-calmly continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) writing-RSB- You must have frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). HIGGINS. Frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)! nonsense! What am I to do?
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Do without, I'm afraid, Henry. The girl has a perfect right to leave if she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) chooses. HIGGINS -LSB-wandering distractedly across the room-RSB-
<p/>But I can't find anything. I don't know what appointments I've got. I'm-- -LSB-Pickering comes in. Mrs. Higgins puts down her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) pen and turns away from the writing-table-RSB-. PICKERING -LSB-shaking hands-RSB- Good-morning, Mrs. Higgins.
<p/>Has Henry told you? -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sits down on the ottoman-RSB-. HIGGINS. What does that ass of an inspector say? Have you offered a reward?
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-rising in indignant amazement-RSB- You don't mean to say you have set the police after Eliza? HIGGINS. Of course.
<p/>What are the police for? What else could we do? -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) sits in the Elizabethan chair-RSB-. PICKERING. The inspector made a lot of difficulties.
<p/>What right have you to go to the police and give the girl's name as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were a thief, or a lost umbrella, or something?
<p/>I really think he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) suspected us of some improper purpose. MRS. HIGGINS. Well, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) did. Really! -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) sits down again, deeply vexed-RSB-. HIGGINS.
<p/>But we want to find her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). PICKERING. We can't let her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) go like this, you know, Mrs. Higgins. What were we to do?
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. You have no more sense, either of you, than two children. Why-- The parlor-maid comes in and breaks off the conversation.
<p/>THE PARLOR-MAID. Mr. Henry: a gentleman wants to see you very particular. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s been sent on from Wimpole Street. HIGGINS. Oh, bother!
<p/>I can't see anyone now. Who is it? THE PARLOR-MAID. A Mr. Doolittle, Sir. PICKERING. Doolittle! Do you mean the dustman?
<p/>THE PARLOR-MAID. Dustman! Oh no, sir: a gentleman. HIGGINS -LSB-springing up excitedly-RSB- By George, Pick, it's some relative of hers that she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'s gone to.
<p/>Somebody we know nothing about. -LSB-To the parlor-maid-RSB- Send him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up, quick. THE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, Sir. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) goes-RSB-. HIGGINS -LSB-eagerly, going to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother-RSB-
<p/>Genteel relatives! now we shall hear something. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sits down in the Chippendale chair-RSB-. MRS. HIGGINS. Do you know any of her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) people?
<p/>PICKERING. Only her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) father: the fellow we told you about. THE PARLOR-MAID -LSB-announcing-RSB- Mr. Doolittle. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) withdraws-RSB-. Doolittle enters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) is brilliantly dressed in a new fashionable frock-coat, with white waistcoat and grey trousers.
<p/>A flower in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) buttonhole, a dazzling silk hat, and patent leather shoes complete the effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) is too concerned with the business he (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) has come on to notice Mrs. Higgins.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) walks straight to Higgins, and accosts him (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) with vehement reproach. DOOLITTLE -LSB-indicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) own person-RSB- See here! Do you see this?
<p/>You done this. HIGGINS. Done what, man? DOOLITTLE. This, I tell you. Look at it. Look at this hat. Look at this coat.
<p/>PICKERING. Has Eliza been buying you clothes? DOOLITTLE. Eliza! not she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>). Not half. Why would she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) buy me clothes? MRS. HIGGINS.
<p/>Good-morning, Mr. Doolittle. Won't you sit down? DOOLITTLE -LSB-taken aback as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) becomes conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) has forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) hostess-RSB- Asking your pardon, ma'am.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) approaches her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) and shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) proffered hand-RSB-. Thank you. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) sits down on the ottoman, on Pickering's right-RSB-. I am that full of what has happened to me that I can't think of anything else.
<p/>HIGGINS. What the dickens has happened to you? DOOLITTLE. I shouldn't mind if it had only happened to me: anything might happen to anybody and nobody to blame
<p/>but Providence, as you might say. But this is something that you done to me: yes, you, Henry Higgins. HIGGINS. Have you found Eliza?
<p/>That's the point. DOOLITTLE. Have you lost her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>)? HIGGINS. Yes. DOOLITTLE. You have all the luck, you have. I ain't found her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>)'ll find me quick enough now after what you done to me.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. But what has my son done to you, Mr. Doolittle? DOOLITTLE. Done to me! Ruined me. Destroyed my happiness.
<p/>Tied me up and delivered me into the hands of middle class morality. HIGGINS -LSB-rising intolerantly and standing over Doolittle-RSB- You're raving.
<p/>You're drunk. You're mad. I gave you five pounds. After that I had two conversations with you, at half-a-crown an hour.
<p/>Did you or did you not write a letter to an old blighter in America that was giving five millions to found Moral Reform Societies all over the world, and that wanted you to invent a universal language for him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?
<p/>I've never seen you since. DOOLITTLE. Oh! Drunk! am I? Mad! am I? Tell me this. HIGGINS. What! Ezra D. Wannafeller!
<p/>Now did you or did you not write a letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ezra</b></font>) to say that the most original moralist at present in England, to the best of your knowledge, was Alfred Doolittle, a common dustman.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>)'s dead. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) sits down again carelessly-RSB-. DOOLITTLE. Yes: he (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>)'s dead; and I'm done for. HIGGINS. Oh, after your last visit I remember making some silly joke of the kind.
<p/>Just give him (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) the chance he (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) wanted to show that Americans is not like us: that they recognize and respect merit in every class of life, however humble.
<p/>Them words is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) blooming will, in which, Henry Higgins, thanks to your silly joking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) leaves me a share in his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) Pre-digested Cheese Trust worth three thousand a year on condition that I lecture for his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) Wannafeller Moral Reform World League as often as they ask me up to six times a year.
<p/>DOOLITTLE. Ah! you may well call it a silly joke. It put the lid on me right enough. HIGGINS. The devil he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) does!
<p/>Whew! -LSB-Brightening suddenly-RSB- What a lark! PICKERING. A safe thing for you, Doolittle. They won't ask you twice. DOOLITTLE. It ain't the lecturing I mind.
<p/>I'll lecture them blue in the face, I will, and not turn a hair. It's making a gentleman of me that I object to.
<p/>Who asked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to make a gentleman of me? I was happy. I was free. I touched pretty nigh everybody for money when I wanted it, same as I touched you, Henry Higgins.
<p/>Now I am worrited; tied neck and heels; and everybody touches me for money. It's a fine thing for you, says my solicitor.
<p/>When I was a poor man and had a solicitor once when they found a pram in the dust cart, he (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) got me off, and got shut of me and got me shut of him (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) as quick as he (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) could.
<p/>Same with the doctors: used to shove me out of the hospital before I could hardly stand on my legs, and nothing to pay.
<p/>Now they finds out that I'm not a healthy man and can't live unless they looks after me twice a day.
<p/>In the house I'm not let do a hand's turn for myself: somebody else must do it and touch me for it.
<p/>Is it? says I. You mean it's a good thing for you, I says. A year ago I hadn't a relative in the world except two or three that wouldn't speak to me.
<p/>Now I've fifty, and not a decent week's wages among the lot of them. I have to live for others and not for myself:
<p/>that's middle class morality. You talk of losing Eliza. Don't you be anxious: I bet she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'s on my doorstep by this:
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) that could support herself easy by selling flowers if I wasn't respectable. And the next one to touch me will be you, Henry Higgins.
<p/>I'll have to learn to speak middle class language from you, instead of speaking proper English. That's where you'll come in; and I daresay that's what you done it for.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. But, my dear Mr. Doolittle, you need not suffer all this if you are really in earnest. Nobody can force you to accept this bequest.
<p/>You can repudiate it. Isn't that so, Colonel Pickering? PICKERING. I believe so. DOOLITTLE -LSB-softening his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) manner in deference to her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) sex-RSB-
<p/>That's the tragedy of it, ma'am. It's easy to say chuck it; but I haven't the nerve. Which one of us has?
<p/>We're all intimidated. Intimidated, ma'am: that's what we are. What is there for me if I chuck it but the workhouse in my old age?
<p/>If I was one of the deserving poor, and had put by a bit, I could chuck it; but then why should I, acause the deserving poor might as well be millionaires for all the happiness they ever has.
<p/>But I, as one of the undeserving poor, have nothing between me and the pauper's uniform but this here blasted three thousand a year that shoves me into the middle class.
<p/>I have to dye my hair already to keep my job as a dustman. They don't know what happiness is. -LRB-Excuse the expression, ma'am: you'd use it yourself if you had my provocation-RRB-.
<p/>They've got you every way you turn: it's a choice between the Skilly of the workhouse and the Char Bydis of the middle class; and I haven't the nerve for the workhouse.
<p/>Happier men than me will call for my dust, and touch me for their tip; and I'll look on helpless, and envy them.
<p/>Intimidated: that's what I am. Broke. Bought up. And that's what your son has brought me to. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is overcome by emotion-RSB-. MRS.
<p/>HIGGINS. Well, I'm very glad you're not going to do anything foolish, Mr. Doolittle. For this solves the problem of Eliza's future.
<p/>You can provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) now. DOOLITTLE -LSB-with melancholy resignation-RSB- Yes, ma'am; I'm expected to provide for everyone now, out of three thousand a year.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-jumping up-RSB- Nonsense! he (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) can't provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) shan't provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) doesn't belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>). I paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) five pounds for her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>).
<p/>Doolittle: either you're an honest man or a rogue. DOOLITTLE -LSB-tolerantly-RSB- A little of both, Henry, like the rest of us: a little of both.
<p/>HIGGINS. Well, you took that money for the girl; and you have no right to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as well. MRS. HIGGINS.
<p/>Henry: don't be absurd. If you really want to know where Eliza is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) is upstairs. HIGGINS -LSB-amazed-RSB- Upstairs!!! Then I shall jolly soon fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) downstairs.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) makes resolutely for the door-RSB-. MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-rising and following him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)-RSB- Be quiet, Henry. Sit down. HIGGINS. I-- MRS. HIGGINS.
<p/>Sit down, dear; and listen to me. HIGGINS. Oh very well, very well, very well. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) throws himself ungraciously on the ottoman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) face towards the windows-RSB-.
<p/>But I think you might have told me this half an hour ago. MRS. HIGGINS. Eliza came to me this morning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) passed the night partly walking about in a rage, partly trying to throw herself into the river and being afraid to, and partly in the Carlton Hotel.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) told me of the brutal way you two treated her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>). HIGGINS -LSB-bounding up again-RSB- What! PICKERING -LSB-rising also-RSB- My dear Mrs. Higgins, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>)'s been telling you stories.
<p/>We didn't treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) brutally. We hardly said a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>); and we parted on particularly good terms. -LSB-Turning on Higgins-RSB-. Higgins: did you bully her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) after I went to bed?
<p/>HIGGINS. Just the other way about. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) threw my slippers in my face. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) behaved in the most outrageous way. I never gave her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) the slightest provocation.
<p/>The slippers came bang into my face the moment I entered the room--before I had uttered a word. And used perfectly awful language.
<p/>PICKERING -LSB-astonished-RSB- But why? What did we do to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)? MRS. HIGGINS. I think I know pretty well what you did.
<p/>The girl is naturally rather affectionate, I think. Isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), Mr. Doolittle? DOOLITTLE. Very tender-hearted, ma'am. Takes after me. MRS. HIGGINS.
<p/>Just so. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) had become attached to you both. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) worked very hard for you, Henry! I don't think you quite realize what anything in the nature of brain work means to a girl like that.
<p/>Well, it seems that when the great day of trial came, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did this wonderful thing for you without making a single mistake, you two sat there and never said a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but talked together of how glad you were that it was all over and how you had been bored with the whole thing.
<p/>And then you were surprised because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) threw your slippers at you! I should have thrown the fire-irons at you. HIGGINS.
<p/>We said nothing except that we were tired and wanted to go to bed. Did we, Pick? PICKERING -LSB-shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) shoulders-RSB-
<p/>That was all. MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-ironically-RSB- Quite sure? PICKERING. Absolutely. Really, that was all. MRS. HIGGINS. You didn't thank her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), or pet her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), or admire her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), or tell her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) how splendid she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'d been.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-impatiently-RSB- But she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) knew all about that. We didn't make speeches to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), if that's what you mean. PICKERING -LSB-conscience stricken-RSB-
<p/>Well, I'm afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) won't go back to Wimpole Street, especially now that Mr. Doolittle is able to keep up the position you have thrust on her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) is quite willing to meet you on friendly terms and to let bygones be bygones.
<p/>Perhaps we were a little inconsiderate. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) very angry? MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) place at the writing-table-RSB- HIGGINS -LSB-furious-RSB-
<p/>Is she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>), by George? Ho! MRS. HIGGINS. If you promise to behave yourself, Henry, I'll ask her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) to come down. If not, go home; for you have taken up quite enough of my time.
<p/>HIGGINS. Oh, all right. Very well. Pick: you behave yourself. Let us put on our best Sunday manners for this creature that we picked out of the mud.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) flings himself sulkily into the Elizabethan chair-RSB-. DOOLITTLE -LSB-remonstrating-RSB- Now, now, Henry Higgins! have some consideration for my feelings as a middle class man.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) presses the bell-button on the writing-table-RSB-. Mr. Doolittle: will you be so good as to step out on the balcony for a moment.
<p/>I don't want Eliza to have the shock of your news until she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) has made it up with these two gentlemen.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Remember your promise, Henry. Would you mind? DOOLITTLE. As you wish, lady. Anything to help Henry to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) off my hands.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) disappears through the window-RSB-. The parlor-maid answers the bell. Pickering sits down in Doolittle's place. MRS. HIGGINS. Ask Miss Doolittle to come down, please.
<p/>THE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, mam. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) goes out-RSB-. MRS. HIGGINS. Now, Henry: be good. HIGGINS. I am behaving myself perfectly. PICKERING. He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) is doing his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) best, Mrs. Higgins.
<p/>A pause. Higgins throws back his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) head; stretches out his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) legs; and begins to whistle. MRS. HIGGINS. Henry, dearest, you don't look at all nice in that attitude.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-pulling himself together-RSB- I was not trying to look nice, mother. MRS. HIGGINS. It doesn't matter, dear. I only wanted to make you speak.
<p/>HIGGINS. Why? MRS. HIGGINS. Because you can't speak and whistle at the same time. Higgins groans. Another very trying pause. HIGGINS -LSB-springing up, out of patience-RSB-
<p/>Where the devil is that girl? Are we to wait here all day? Eliza enters, sunny, self-possessed, and giving a staggeringly convincing exhibition of ease of manner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) carries a little work-basket, and is very much at home. Pickering is too much taken aback to rise. LIZA. How do you do, Professor Higgins?
<p/>Are you quite well? HIGGINS -LSB-choking-RSB- Am I-- -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) can say no more-RSB-. LIZA. But of course you are: you are never ill.
<p/>So glad to see you again, Colonel Pickering. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) rises hastily; and they shake hands-RSB-. Quite chilly this morning, isn't it?
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) sits down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) sits beside her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB-. HIGGINS. Don't you dare try this game on me. I taught it to you; and it doesn't take me in.
<p/>Eliza takes a piece of needlework from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) basket, and begins to stitch at it, without taking the least notice of this outburst.
<p/>Get up and come home; and don't be a fool. MRS. HIGGINS. Very nicely put, indeed, Henry. No woman could resist such an invitation.
<p/>You will jolly soon see whether she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) has an idea that I haven't put into her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) head or a word that I haven't put into her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>I tell you I have created this thing out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) pretends to play the fine lady with me.
<p/>HIGGINS. You let her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) alone, mother. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) speak for herself. MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-placidly-RSB- Yes, dear; but you'll sit down, won't you?
<p/>LIZA -LSB-to Pickering, taking no apparent notice of Higgins, and working away deftly-RSB- Will you drop me altogether now that the experiment is over, Colonel Pickering?
<p/>Higgins sits down again, savagely. PICKERING. Oh don't. You mustn't think of it as an experiment. It shocks me, somehow. LIZA.
<p/>Oh, I'm only a squashed cabbage leaf. PICKERING -LSB-impulsively-RSB- No. LIZA -LSB-continuing quietly-RSB---but I owe so much to you that I should be very unhappy if you forgot me.
<p/>PICKERING. It's very kind of you to say so, Miss Doolittle. LIZA. It's not because you paid for my dresses. I know you are generous to everybody with money.
<p/>But it was from you that I learnt really nice manners; and that is what makes one a lady, isn't it?
<p/>I was brought up to be just like him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>), unable to control myself, and using bad language on the slightest provocation.
<p/>You see it was so very difficult for me with the example of Professor Higgins always before me. And I should never have known that ladies and gentlemen didn't behave like that if you hadn't been there.
<p/>HIGGINS. Well!! PICKERING. Oh, that's only his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) way, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) doesn't mean it. LIZA. Oh, I didn't mean it either, when I was a flower girl.
<p/>It was only my way. But you see I did it; and that's what makes the difference after all. PICKERING. No doubt.
<p/>Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) taught you to speak; and I couldn't have done that, you know. LIZA -LSB-trivially-RSB- Of course: that is his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) profession.
<p/>HIGGINS. Damnation! LIZA -LSB-continuing-RSB- It was just like learning to dance in the fashionable way: there was nothing more than that in it.
<p/>But do you know what began my real education? PICKERING. What? LIZA -LSB-stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) work for a moment-RSB- Your calling me Miss Doolittle that day when I first came to Wimpole Street.
<p/>That was the beginning of self-respect for me. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) resumes her (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) stitching-RSB-. And there were a hundred little things you never noticed, because they came naturally to you.
<p/>Yes: things that showed you thought and felt about me as if I were something better than a scullerymaid; though of course I know you would have been just the same to a scullery-maid if she (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) had been let in the drawing-room.
<p/>Things about standing up and taking off your hat and opening doors-- PICKERING. Oh, that was nothing. LIZA. You never took off your boots in the dining room when I was there.
<p/>PICKERING. You mustn't mind that. Higgins takes off his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) boots all over the place. LIZA. I know. I am not blaming him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>).
<p/>You see, really and truly, apart from the things anyone can pick up -LRB-the dressing and the proper way of speaking, and so on-RRB-, the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) behaves, but how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s treated.
<p/>I shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) always treats me as a flower girl, and always will; but I know I can be a lady to you, because you always treat me as a lady, and always will.
<p/>It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) way, isn't it? But it made such a difference to me that you didn't do it. MRS. HIGGINS.
<p/>Please don't grind your teeth, Henry. PICKERING. Well, this is really very nice of you, Miss Doolittle. LIZA. I should like you to call me Eliza, now, if you would.
<p/>PICKERING. Thank you. Eliza, of course. LIZA. And I should like Professor Higgins to call me Miss Doolittle. HIGGINS. I'll see you damned first.
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Henry! Henry! PICKERING -LSB-laughing-RSB- Why don't you slang back at him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>)? Don't stand it. It would do him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) a lot of good.
<p/>Last night, when I was wandering about, a girl spoke to me; and I tried to get back into the old way with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); but it was no use.
<p/>You told me, you know, that when a child is brought to a foreign country, it picks up the language in a few weeks, and forgets its own.
<p/>LIZA. I can't. I could have done it once; but now I can't go back to it. Well, I am a child in your country.
<p/>I have forgotten my own language, and can speak nothing but yours. That's the real break-off with the corner of Tottenham Court Road.
<p/>Leaving Wimpole Street finishes it. PICKERING -LSB-much alarmed-RSB- Oh! but you're coming back to Wimpole Street, aren't you? You'll forgive Higgins?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-rising-RSB- Forgive! Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>), by George! Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) go. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) find out how she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) can get on without us.
<p/>With a look of dignified reproach at Higgins, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) comes slowly and silently to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) daughter, who, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) back to the window, is unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) approach.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) will relapse into the gutter in three weeks without me at her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) elbow. Doolittle appears at the centre window. PICKERING.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>)'s incorrigible, Eliza. You won't relapse, will you? LIZA. No: Not now. Never again. I have learnt my lesson. I don't believe I could utter one of the old sounds if I tried.
<p/>-LSB-Doolittle touches her (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) left shoulder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) drops her (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) work, losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) self-possession utterly at the spectacle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) father's splendor
<p/>-RSB- A--a--a--a--a--ah--ow--ooh! HIGGINS -LSB-with a crow of triumph-RSB- Aha! Just so. A--a--a--a--ahowooh! A--a--a--a--ahowooh ! A--a--a--a--ahowooh! Victory! Victory! -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) throws himself on the divan, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms, and spraddling arrogantly-RSB-. DOOLITTLE.
<p/>Can you blame the girl? Don't look at me like that, Eliza. It ain't my fault. I've come into money. LIZA.
<p/>You must have touched a millionaire this time, dad. DOOLITTLE. I have. But I'm dressed something special today. I'm going to St. George's, Hanover Square.
<p/>Your stepmother is going to marry me. LIZA -LSB-angrily-RSB- You're going to let yourself down to marry that low common woman!
<p/>PICKERING -LSB-quietly-RSB- He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) ought to, Eliza. -LSB-To Doolittle-RSB- Why has she (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) mind? DOOLITTLE -LSB-sadly-RSB- Intimidated, Governor. Intimidated. Middle class morality claims its victim.
<p/>Won't you put on your hat, Liza, and come and see me turned off? LIZA. If the Colonel says I must, I--I'll -LSB-almost sobbing-RSB- I'll demean myself.
<p/>And get insulted for my pains, like enough. DOOLITTLE. Don't be afraid: she (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>) never comes to words with anyone now, poor woman!
<p/>respectability has broke all the spirit out of her (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>). PICKERING -LSB-squeezing Eliza's elbow gently-RSB- Be kind to them, Eliza. Make the best of it.
<p/>LIZA -LSB-forcing a little smile for him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) vexation-RSB- Oh well, just to show there's no ill feeling. I'll be back in a moment.
<p/>-LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) goes out-RSB-. DOOLITTLE -LSB-sitting down beside Pickering-RSB- I feel uncommon nervous about the ceremony, Colonel. I wish you'd come and see me through it.
<p/>PICKERING. But you've been through it before, man. You were married to Eliza's mother. DOOLITTLE. Who told you that, Colonel? PICKERING.
<p/>Well, nobody told me. But I concluded naturally-- DOOLITTLE. No: that ain't the natural way , Colonel: it's only the middle class way.
<p/>My way was always the undeserving way. But don't say nothing to Eliza. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) don't know: I always had a delicacy about telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
<p/>PICKERING. Quite right. We'll leave it so, if you don't mind. DOOLITTLE. And you'll come to the church, Colonel, and put me through straight?
<p/>PICKERING. With pleasure. As far as a bachelor can. MRS. HIGGINS. May I come, Mr. Doolittle? I should be very sorry to miss your wedding.
<p/>I should indeed be honored by your condescension, ma'am; and my poor old woman would take it as a tremenjous compliment.
<p/>DOOLITTLE. She (<font color='blue'><b>DOOLITTLE</b></font>)'s been very low, thinking of the happy days that are no more. MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-rising-RSB- I'll order the carriage and get ready.
<p/>-LSB-The men rise, except Higgins-RSB-. I shan't be more than fifteen minutes. -LSB-As she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) goes to the door Eliza comes in, hatted and buttoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) gloves-RSB-.
<p/>I'm going to the church to see your father married, Eliza. You had better come in the brougham with me. Colonel Pickering can go on with the bridegroom.
<p/>Mrs. Higgins goes out. Eliza comes to the middle of the room between the centre window and the ottoman. Pickering joins her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
<p/>DOOLITTLE. Bridegroom! What a word! It makes a man realize his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) position, somehow. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) takes up his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) hat and goes towards the door-RSB-. PICKERING.
<p/>Before I go, Eliza, do forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) and come back to us. LIZA. I don't think papa would allow me. Would you, dad?
<p/>DOOLITTLE -LSB-sad but magnanimous-RSB- They played you off very cunning, Eliza, them two sportsmen. If it had been only one of them, you could have nailed him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>).
<p/>But you see, there was two; and one of them chaperoned the other, as you might say. -LSB-To Pickering-RSB- It was artful of you, Colonel; but I bear no malice
<p/>I been the victim of one woman after another all my life; and I don't grudge you two getting the better of Eliza.
<p/>: I should have done the same myself. I shan't interfere. It's time for us to go, Colonel. So long, Henry.
<p/>See you in St. George's, Eliza. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) goes out-RSB-. PICKERING -LSB-coaxing-RSB- Do stay with us, Eliza. -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) follows Doolittle-RSB-. Eliza goes out on the balcony to avoid being alone with Higgins.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) immediately comes back into the room and makes for the door; but he (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) goes along the balcony quickly and gets his (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) back to the door before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) reaches it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>PICKERING</b></font>) rises and joins her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) there. HIGGINS. Well, Eliza, you've had a bit of your own back, as you call it.
<p/>You want me back only to pick up your slippers and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you.
<p/>Have you had enough? and are you going to be reasonable? Or do you want any more? LIZA. HIGGINS. I haven't said I wanted you back at all.
<p/>LIZA. Oh, indeed. Then what are we talking about? HIGGINS. About you, not about me. If you come back I shall treat you just as I have always treated you.
<p/>I can't change my nature; and I don't intend to change my manners. My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering's.
<p/>LIZA. That's not true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) treats a flower girl as if she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) was a duchess. HIGGINS. And I treat a duchess as if she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) was a flower girl.
<p/>LIZA. I see. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) turns away composedly, and sits on the ottoman, facing the window-RSB-. The same to everybody. HIGGINS. Just so.
<p/>Without accepting the comparison at all points, Eliza, it's quite true that your father is not a snob, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be quite at home in any station of life to which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eccentric destiny may call him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>-LSB-Seriously-RSB- The great secret, Eliza, is not having bad manners or good manners or any other particular sort of manners, but having the same manner for all human souls: in short, behaving as if you were in Heaven, where there are no third-class carriages, and one soul is as good as another.
<p/>LIZA. Like father. HIGGINS -LSB-grinning, a little taken down-RSB- LIZA. Amen. You are a born preacher. HIGGINS -LSB-irritated-RSB- The question is not whether I treat you rudely, but whether you ever heard me treat anyone else better.
<p/>LIZA -LSB-with sudden sincerity-RSB- I don't care how you treat me. I don't mind your swearing at me. I don't mind a black eye: I've had one before this.
<p/>But -LSB-standing up and facing him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>)-RSB- I won't be passed over. HIGGINS. Then get out of my way; for I won't stop for you.
<p/>You talk about me as if I were a motor bus. LIZA. So you are a motor bus: all bounce and go, and no consideration for anyone.
<p/>But I can do without you: don't think I can't. HIGGINS. I know you can. I told you you could. LIZA -LSB-wounded, getting away from him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) to the other side of the ottoman with her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) face to the hearth-RSB-
<p/>I know you did, you brute. You wanted to get rid of me. HIGGINS. Liar. LIZA. Thank you. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) sits down with dignity-RSB-. HIGGINS.
<p/>You never asked yourself, I suppose, whether I could do without YOU. LIZA -LSB-earnestly-RSB- Don't you try to get round me.
<p/>You'll HAVE to do without me. HIGGINS -LSB-arrogant-RSB- I can do without anybody. I have my own soul: my own spark of divine fire.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sits down near her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>) on the ottoman-RSB-. I have learnt something from your idiotic notions: I confess that humbly and gratefully.
<p/>But -LSB-with sudden humility-RSB- I shall miss you, Eliza. And I have grown accustomed to your voice and appearance. I like them, rather.
<p/>LIZA. Well, you have both of them on your gramophone and in your book of photographs. When you feel lonely without me, you can turn the machine on.
<p/>It's got no feelings to hurt. HIGGINS. I can't turn your soul on. Leave me those feelings; and you can take away the voice and the face.
<p/>They are not you. LIZA. Oh, you ARE a devil. You can twist the heart in a girl as easy as some could twist her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) arms to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Pearce warned me. Time and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) has wanted to leave you; and you always got round her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>) at the last minute.
<p/>I care for life, for humanity; and you are a part of it that has come my way and been built into my house.
<p/>And you don't care a bit for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pearce</b></font>). And you don't care a bit for me. HIGGINS. What more can you or anyone ask?
<p/>LIZA. I won't care for anybody that doesn't care for me. HIGGINS. Commercial principles, Eliza. Like -LSB-reproducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) Covent Garden pronunciation with professional exactness-RSB- s`yollin voylets -LSB-selling violets-RSB-, isn't it?
<p/>LIZA. Don't sneer at me. It's mean to sneer at me. HIGGINS. I have never sneered in my life. Sneering doesn't become either the human face or the human soul.
<p/>You call me a brute because you couldn't buy a claim on me by fetching my slippers and finding my spectacles.
<p/>You were a fool: I think a woman fetching a man's slippers is a disgusting sight: did I ever fetch YOUR slippers?
<p/>I am expressing my righteous contempt for Commercialism. I don't and won't trade in affection. I think a good deal more of you for throwing them in my face.
<p/>No use slaving for me and then saying you want to be cared for: who cares for a slave? If you come back, come back for the sake of good fellowship; for you'll get nothing else.
<p/>You've had a thousand times as much out of me as I have out of you; and if you dare to set up your little dog's tricks of fetching and carrying slippers against my creation of a Duchess Eliza, I'll slam the door in your silly face.
<p/>LIZA. What did you do it for if you didn't care for me? HIGGINS -LSB-heartily-RSB- Why, because it was my job.
<p/>LIZA. You never thought of the trouble it would make for me. HIGGINS. Would the world ever have been made if its maker had been afraid of making trouble?
<p/>Making life means making trouble. There's only one way of escaping trouble; and that's killing things. Cowards, you notice, are always shrieking to have troublesome people killed.
<p/>LIZA. I'm no preacher : I don't notice things like that. I notice that you don't notice me. HIGGINS -LSB-jumping up and walking about intolerantly-RSB-
<p/>Once for all, understand that I go my way and do my work without caring twopence what happens to either of us.
<p/>Eliza: you're an idiot. I waste the treasures of my Miltonic mind by spreading them before you. I am not intimidated, like your father and your stepmother.
<p/>So you can come back or go to the devil: which you please. LIZA. What am I to come back for?
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-bouncing up on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knees on the ottoman and leaning over it to her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB- For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.
<p/>LIZA -LSB-with averted face-RSB- And you may throw me out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want me to? HIGGINS.
<p/>Yes; and you may walk out tomorrow if I don't do everything YOU want me to. LIZA. And live with my stepmother?
<p/>HIGGINS. Yes, or sell flowers. LIZA. Oh! if I only COULD go back to my flower basket! I should be independent of both you and father and all the world!
<p/>Why did you take my independence from me? Why did I give it up? I'm a slave now, for all my fine clothes.
<p/>HIGGINS. Not a bit. I'll adopt you as my daughter and settle money on you if you like. Or would you rather marry Pickering?
<p/>LIZA -LSB-looking fiercely round at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>)-RSB- I wouldn't marry YOU if you asked me; and you're nearer my age than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) is.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-gently-RSB- Than he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) is: not <div class="bookquote">``than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>LIZA -LSB-losing her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) temper and rising-RSB- I'll talk as I like.
<p/>You're not my teacher now. HIGGINS -LSB-reflectively -RSB- I don't suppose Pickering would, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>)'s as confirmed an old bachelor as I am.
<p/>LIZA. That's not what I want; and don't you think it. I've always had chaps enough wanting me that way. Freddy Hill writes to me twice and three times a day, sheets and sheets.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-disagreeably surprised-RSB- Damn his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) impudence! -LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) recoils and finds himself sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) heels-RSB-. LIZA. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) has a right to if he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) likes, poor lad.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) does love me. HIGGINS -LSB-getting off the ottoman-RSB- You have no right to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>). LIZA. Every girl has a right to be loved.
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)'s weak and poor and wants me, may be he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)'d make me happier than my betters that bully me and don't want me.
<p/>HIGGINS. What! By fools like that? LIZA. Freddy's not a fool. HIGGINS. Can he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) MAKE anything of you? That's the point.
<p/>LIZA. Perhaps I could make something of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). But I never thought of us making anything of one another; and you never think of anything else.
<p/>I only want to be natural. HIGGINS. In short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as Freddy? Is that it?
<p/>LIZA. No I don't. That's not the sort of feeling I want from you. And don't you be too sure of yourself or of me.
<p/>I could have been a bad girl if I'd liked. I've seen more of some things than you, for all your learning.
<p/>Girls like me can drag gentlemen down to make love to them easy enough. And they wish each other dead the next minute.
<p/>HIGGINS. Of course they do. Then what in thunder are we quarrelling about? LIZA -LSB-much troubled-RSB- I want a little kindness.
<p/>What I done -LSB-correcting herself-RSB- what I did was not for the dresses and the taxis: I did it because we were pleasant together
<p/>and I come--came--to care for you; not to want you to make love to me, and not forgetting the difference between us, but more friendly like.
<p/>I know I'm a common ignorant girl, and you a book-learned gentleman; but I'm not dirt under your feet. HIGGINS. Well, of course.
<p/>That's just how I feel. And how Pickering feels. Eliza: you're a fool. LIZA. That's not a proper answer to give me
<p/>-LSB-she (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) sinks on the chair at the writing-table in tears-RSB-. HIGGINS. It's all you'll get until you stop being a common idiot.
<p/>If you're going to be a lady, you'll have to give up feeling neglected if the men you know don't spend half their time snivelling over you and the other half giving you black eyes.
<p/>If you can't stand the coldness of my sort of life, and the strain of it, go back to the gutter.
<p/>Work til you are more a brute than a human being; and then cuddle and squabble and drink til you fall asleep.
<p/>it's violent: you can feel it through the thickest skin: you can taste it and smell it without any training or any work.
<p/>Oh, it's a fine life, the life of the gutter. It's real: it's warm: Not like Science and Literature and Classical Music and Philosophy and Art.
<p/>You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you? Very well: be off with you to the sort of people you like.
<p/>Marry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money, and a thick pair of lips to kiss you with and a thick pair of boots to kick you with.
<p/>If you can't appreciate what you've got, you'd better get what you can appreciate. LIZA -LSB-desperate-RSB- Oh, you are a cruel tyrant.
<p/>I can't talk to you: you turn everything against me: I'm always in the wrong. But you know very well all the time that you're nothing but a bully.
<p/>You know I can't go back to the gutter, as you call it, and that I have no real friends in the world but you and the Colonel.
<p/>You know well I couldn't bear to live with a low common man after you two; and it's wicked and cruel of you to insult me by pretending I could.
<p/>You think I must go back to Wimpole Street because I have nowhere else to go but father's. But don't you be too sure that you have me under your feet to be trampled on and talked down.
<p/>I'll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)'s able to support me. HIGGINS -LSB-sitting down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB- Rubbish! you shall marry an ambassador.
<p/>You shall marry the Governor-General of India or the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, or somebody who wants a deputy-queen. I'm not going to have my masterpiece thrown away on Freddy.
<p/>But I haven't forgot what you said a minute ago; and I won't be coaxed round as if I was a baby or a puppy.
<p/>LIZA. You think I like you to say that. If I can't have kindness, I'll have independence. HIGGINS. Independence? That's middle class blasphemy.
<p/>We are all dependent on one another, every soul of us on earth. LIZA -LSB-rising determinedly-RSB- I'll let you see whether I'm dependent on you.
<p/>If you can preach, I can teach. I'll go and be a teacher. HIGGINS. What'll you teach, in heaven's name? LIZA.
<p/>What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics. HIGGINS. Ha! Ha! Ha! LIZA. I'll offer myself as an assistant to Professor Nepean.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-rising in a fury-RSB- What! That impostor! that humbug! that toadying ignoramus! Teach him (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) my methods! my discoveries! You take one step in his (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) direction and I'll wring your neck.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) lays hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB-. Do you hear? LIZA -LSB-defiantly non-resistant-RSB- Wring away. What do I care? I knew you'd strike me some day.
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) lets her (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) go, stamping with rage at having forgotten himself, and recoils so hastily that he (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) stumbles back into his (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) seat on the ottoman-RSB-. Aha!
<p/>Now I know how to deal with you. What a fool I was not to think of it before! You can't take away the knowledge you gave me.
<p/>You said I had a finer ear than you. And I can be civil and kind to people, which is more than you can.
<p/>Aha! That's done you, Henry Higgins, it has. Now I don't care that -LSB-snapping her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) fingers-RSB- for your bullying and your big talk.
<p/>I'll advertize it in the papers that your duchess is only a flower girl that you taught, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)'ll teach anybody to be a duchess just the same in six months for a thousand guineas.
<p/>Oh, when I think of myself crawling under your feet and being trampled on and called names, when all the time I had only to lift up my finger to be as good as you, I could just kick myself.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-wondering at her (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)-RSB- You damned impudent slut, you! But it's better than snivelling; better than fetching slippers and finding spectacles, isn't it?
<p/>-LSB-Rising-RSB- By George, Eliza, I said I'd make a woman of you; and I have. I like you like this. LIZA.
<p/>Yes: you turn round and make up to me now that I'm not afraid of you, and can do without you.
<p/>HIGGINS. Of course I do, you little fool. Five minutes ago you were like a millstone round my neck. Now you're a tower of strength: a consort battleship.
<p/>You and I and Pickering will be three old bachelors together instead of only two men and a silly girl. Mrs. Higgins returns, dressed for the wedding.
<p/>Eliza instantly becomes cool and elegant. MRS. HIGGINS. The carriage is waiting, Eliza. Are you ready? LIZA. Quite. Is the Professor coming?
<p/>MRS. HIGGINS. Certainly not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) can't behave himself in church. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) makes remarks out loud all the time on the clergyman's pronunciation.
<p/>LIZA. Then I shall not see you again, Professor. Good bye. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) goes to the door-RSB-. MRS. HIGGINS -LSB-coming to Higgins-RSB-
<p/>-LSB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) is about to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) recollects something-RSB-. Oh, by the way, Eliza, order a ham and a Stilton cheese, will you?
<p/>And buy me a pair of reindeer gloves, number eights, and a tie to match that new suit of mine, at Eale & Binman's.
<p/>Good-bye, dear. HIGGINS. Good-bye, mother. You can choose the color. -LSB-His (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) cheerful, careless, vigorous voice shows that he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) is incorrigible-RSB-. LIZA -LSB-disdainfully-RSB-
<p/>Buy them yourself. -LSB-She (<font color='blue'><b>LIZA</b></font>) sweeps out-RSB-. MRS. HIGGINS. I'm afraid you've spoiled that girl, Henry. But never mind, dear: I'll buy you the tie and gloves.
<p/>HIGGINS -LSB-sunnily-RSB- Oh, don't bother. She (<font color='blue'><b>HIGGINS</b></font>)'ll buy em all right enough. Good-bye. They kiss. Mrs. Higgins runs out. Higgins, left alone, rattles his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cash in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pocket; chuckles; and disports himself in a highly self-satisfied manner.
<p/>The rest of the story need not be shown in action, and indeed, would hardly need telling if our imaginations were not so enfeebled by their lazy dependence on the ready-makes and reach-me-downs of the ragshop in which Romance keeps its stock of <div class="bookquote">``happy endings''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to misfit all stories.
<p/>Now, the history of Eliza Doolittle, though called a romance because of the transfiguration it records seems exceedingly improbable, is common enough.
<p/>Such transfigurations have been achieved by hundreds of resolutely ambitious young women since Nell Gwynne set them the example by playing queens and fascinating kings in the theatre in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) began by selling oranges.
<p/>Nevertheless, people in all directions have assumed, for no other reason than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) became the heroine of a romance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) must have married the hero of it.
<p/>This is unbearable, not only because her (<font color='blue'><b>Nell</b></font>) little drama, if acted on such a thoughtless assumption, must be spoiled, but because the true sequel is patent to anyone with a sense of human nature in general, and of feminine instinct in particular.
<p/>Eliza, in telling Higgins she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) would not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>), was not coquetting: she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was announcing a well-considered decision.
<p/>When a bachelor interests, and dominates, and teaches, and becomes important to a spinster, as Higgins with Eliza, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) always, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) has character enough to be capable of it, considers very seriously indeed whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) will play for becoming that bachelor's wife, especially if he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) is so little interested in marriage that a determined and devoted woman might capture him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) set herself resolutely to do it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) decision will depend a good deal on whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is really free to choose; and that, again, will depend on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) age and income.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is at the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) youth, and has no security for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) livelihood, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will marry him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must marry anybody who will provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>* ********************** But at Eliza's age a good-looking girl does not feel that pressure; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feels free to pick and choose.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is therefore guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) instinct in the matter. Eliza's instinct tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) not to marry Higgins. It does not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) up.
<p/>It is not in the slightest doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) remaining one of the strongest personal interests in her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) life. It would be very sorely strained if there was another woman likely to supplant her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>).
<p/>But as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feels sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) on that last point, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has no doubt at all as to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) course, and would not have any, even if the difference of twenty years in age, which seems so great to youth, did not exist between them.
<p/>As our own instincts are not appealed to by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conclusion, let us see whether we cannot discover some reason in it.
<p/>When Higgins excused his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) indifference to young women on the ground that they had an irresistible rival in his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) gave the clue to his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) inveterate old-bachelordom.
<p/>If an imaginative boy has a sufficiently rich mother who has intelligence, personal grace, dignity of character without harshness, and a cultivated sense of the best art of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) time to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house beautiful, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sets a standard for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) against which very few women can struggle, besides effecting for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) a disengagement of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) affections, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sense of beauty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) idealism from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) specifically sexual impulses.
<p/>This makes him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) a standing puzzle to the huge number of uncultivated people who have been brought up in tasteless homes by commonplace or disagreeable parents, and to whom, consequently, literature, painting, sculpture, music, and affectionate personal relations come as modes of sex if they come at all.
<p/>The word passion means nothing else to them; and that Higgins could have a passion for phonetics and idealize his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mother instead of Eliza, would seem to them absurd and unnatural.
<p/>Nevertheless, when we look round and see that hardly anyone is too ugly or disagreeable to find a wife or a husband if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wants one, whilst many old maids and bachelors are above the average in quality and culture, we cannot help suspecting that the disentanglement of sex from the associations with which it is so commonly confused, a disentanglement which persons of genius achieve by sheer intellectual analysis, is sometimes produced or aided by parental fascination.
<p/>Now, though Eliza was incapable of thus explaining to herself Higgins's formidable powers of resistance to the charm that prostrated Freddy at the first glance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was instinctively aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) could never obtain a complete grip of him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>), or come between him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother -LRB-the first necessity of the married woman-RRB-.
<p/>To put it shortly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that for some mysterious reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had not the makings of a married man in him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>), according to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conception of a husband as one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) nearest and fondest and warmest interest.
<p/>Even had there been no mother-rival, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would still have refused to accept an interest in herself that was secondary to philosophic interests.
<p/>The case is uncommon only to the extent that remarkable mothers are uncommon. Had Mrs. Higgins died, there would still have been Milton and the Universal Alphabet.
<p/>Landor's remark that to those who have the greatest power of loving, love is a secondary affair, would not have recommended Landor to Eliza.
<p/>Put that along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) resentment of Higgins's domineering superiority, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistrust of his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) coaxing cleverness in getting round her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) and evading her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) wrath when he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) had gone too far with his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) impetuous bullying, and you will see that Eliza's instinct had good grounds for warning her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) not to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) Pygmalion.
<p/>And now, whom did Eliza marry? For if Higgins was a predestinate old bachelor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was most certainly not a predestinate old maid.
<p/>Well, that can be told very shortly to those who have not guessed it from the indications she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) has herself given them.
<p/>Almost immediately after Eliza is stung into proclaiming her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) considered determination not to marry Higgins, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) mentions the fact that young Mr. Frederick Eynsford Hill is pouring out his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) daily through the post.
<p/>Now Freddy is young, practically twenty years younger than Higgins: he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) is a gentleman -LRB-or, as Eliza would qualify him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>), a toff-RRB-, and speaks like one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) is nicely dressed, is treated by the Colonel as an equal, loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) unaffectedly, and is not her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) master, nor ever likely to dominate her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) advantage of social standing.
<p/>Eliza has no use for the foolish romantic tradition that all women love to be mastered, if not actually bullied and beaten.
<p/>Sensible despots have never confined that precaution to women: they have taken their whips with them when they have dealt with men, and been slavishly idealized by the men over whom they have flourished the whip much more than by women.
<p/>No doubt there are slavish women as well as slavish men; and women, like men, admire those that are stronger than themselves.
<p/>'' When you go to women,'' says Nietzsche, <div class="bookquote">``take your whip with you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Nietzsche</b></font>)</div>But to admire a strong person and to live under that strong person's thumb are two different things.
<p/>The weak may not be admired and hero-worshipped; but they are by no means disliked or shunned; and they never seem to have the least difficulty in marrying people who are too good for them.
<p/>They may fail in emergencies; but life is not one long emergency: it is mostly a string of situations for which no exceptional strength is needed, and with which even rather weak people can cope if they have a stronger partner to help them out.
<p/>Accordingly, it is a truth everywhere in evidence that strong people, masculine or feminine, not only do not marry stronger people, but do not show any preference for them in selecting their friends.
<p/>When a lion meets another with a louder roar <div class="bookquote">``the first lion thinks the last a bore. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man woman</b></font>)</div>The man or woman who feels strong enough for two, seeks for every other quality in a partner than strength.
<p/>Weak people want to marry strong people who do not frighten them too much; and this often leads them to make the mistake we describe metaphorically as <div class="bookquote">``biting off more than they can chew.
<p/>They want too much for too little; and when the bargain is unreasonable beyond all bearing, the union becomes impossible: it ends in the weaker party being either discarded or borne as a cross, which is worse.
<p/>The converse is also true. ''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>People who are not only weak, but silly or obtuse as well, are often in these difficulties.
<p/>This being the state of human affairs, what is Eliza fairly sure to do when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) is placed between Freddy and Higgins?
<p/>Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) look forward to a lifetime of fetching Higgins's slippers or to a lifetime of Freddy fetching hers? There can be no doubt about the answer.
<p/>Unless Freddy is biologically repulsive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>), and Higgins biologically attractive to a degree that overwhelms all her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) other instincts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) will, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) marries either of them, marry Freddy.
<p/>And that is just what Eliza did. Complications ensued; but they were economic, not romantic. Freddy had no money and no occupation.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother's jointure, a last relic of the opulence of Largelady Park, had enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to struggle along in Earlscourt with an air of gentility, but not to procure any serious secondary education for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children, much less give the boy a profession.
<p/>A clerkship at thirty shillings a week was beneath Freddy's dignity, and extremely distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) besides. His (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) prospects consisted of a hope that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) kept up appearances somebody would do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>).
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother it perhaps appeared as a marriage to some lady of means who could not resist her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) boy's niceness.
<p/>The something appeared vaguely to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) imagination as a private secretaryship or a sinecure of some sort. Fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feelings when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) married a flower girl who had become declassee under extraordinary circumstances which were now notorious!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father, though formerly a dustman, and now fantastically disclassed, had become extremely popular in the smartest society by a social talent which triumphed over every prejudice and every disadvantage.
<p/>Rejected by the middle class, which he (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) loathed, he (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) had shot up at once into the highest circles by his (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) wit, his (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) dustmanship -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) carried like a banner-RRB-, and his (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) Nietzschean transcendence of good and evil.
<p/>At intimate ducal dinners he (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) sat on the right hand of the Duchess; and in country houses he (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) smoked in the pantry and was made much of by the butler when he (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) was not feeding in the dining-room and being consulted by cabinet ministers.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) found it almost as hard to do all this on four thousand a year as Mrs. Eynsford Hill to live in Earlscourt on an income so pitiably smaller that I have not the heart to disclose its exact figure.
<p/>It is true that Eliza's situation did not seem wholly ineligible. He (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) absolutely refused to add the last straw to his (<font color='blue'><b>dustman</b></font>) burden by contributing to Eliza's support.
<p/>Thus Freddy and Eliza, now Mr. and Mrs. Eynsford Hill, would have spent a penniless honeymoon but for a wedding present of 500 pounds from the Colonel to Eliza.
<p/>It lasted a long time because Freddy did not know how to spend money, never having had any to spend, and Eliza, socially trained by a pair of old bachelors, wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) clothes as long as they held together and looked pretty, without the least regard to their being many months out of fashion.
<p/>Still, 500 pounds will not last two young people for ever; and they both knew, and Eliza felt as well, that they must shift for themselves in the end.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) could quarter herself on Wimpole Street because it had come to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) home; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was quite aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) ought not to quarter Freddy there, and that it would not be good for his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) character if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) did.
<p/>Not that the Wimpole Street bachelors objected. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) consulted them, Higgins declined to be bothered about her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) housing problem when that solution was so simple.
<p/>Eliza's desire to have Freddy in the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) seemed of no more importance than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had wanted an extra piece of bedroom furniture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) denied that Freddy had any character, and declared that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) tried to do any useful work some competent person would have the trouble of undoing it: a procedure involving a net loss to the community, and great unhappiness to Freddy himself, who was obviously intended by Nature for such light work as amusing Eliza, which, Higgins declared, was a much more useful and honorable occupation than working in the city.
<p/>When Eliza referred again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) project of teaching phonetics, Higgins abated not a jot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) violent opposition to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was not within ten years of being qualified to meddle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) pet subject; and as it was evident that the Colonel agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) could not go against them in this grave matter, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) had no right, without Higgins's consent, to exploit the knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>); for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) knowledge seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) as much his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) private property as his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) watch:
<p/>Pleas as to Freddy's character, and the moral obligation on him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) own living, were lost on Higgins. Eliza was no communist.
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was superstitiously devoted to them both, more entirely and frankly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) marriage than before it. It was the Colonel who finally solved the problem, which had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) much perplexed cogitation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had thought of it, but had put it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) head, because the Colonel had said, that day at Mrs. Higgins's, that it would never do.
<p/>The Colonel confessed that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had not quite recovered from the dazzling impression of the day before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) one day asked Eliza, rather shyly, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had quite given up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) notion of keeping a flower shop. They broke the matter to Higgins that evening.
<p/>The sole comment vouchsafed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) very nearly led to a serious quarrel with Eliza. It was to the effect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) would have in Freddy an ideal errand boy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had been thinking of a shop himself; though it had presented itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) pennilessness as a small place in which Eliza should sell tobacco at one counter whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) sold newspapers at the opposite one.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) agreed that it would be extraordinarily jolly to go early every morning with Eliza to Covent Garden and buy flowers on the scene of their first meeting:
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had always been afraid to propose anything of the sort, because Clara would make an awful row about a step that must damage her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) matrimonial chances, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) mother could not be expected to like it after clinging for so many years to that step of the social ladder on which retail trade is impossible.
<p/>Freddy himself was next sounded on the subject. a sentiment which earned him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) many kisses from his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) wife. This difficulty was removed by an event highly unexpected by Freddy's mother.
<p/>Clara, in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) incursions into those artistic circles which were the highest within her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) reach, discovered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) conversational qualifications were expected to include a grounding in the novels of Mr. H.G. Wells.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) borrowed them in various directions so energetically that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) swallowed them all within two months. The result was a conversion of a kind quite common today.
<p/>Poor Clara, who appeared to Higgins and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) mother as a disagreeable and ridiculous person, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) own mother as in some inexplicable way a social failure, had never seen herself in either light; for, though to some extent ridiculed and mimicked in West Kensington like everybody else there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was accepted as a rational and normal--or shall we say inevitable?--sort of human being.
<p/>At worst they called her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) The Pusher; but to them no more than to herself had it ever occurred that she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was pushing the air, and pushing it in a wrong direction.
<p/>A modern Acts of the Apostles would fill fifty whole Bibles if anyone were capable of writing it. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was not happy.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) one asset, the fact that her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) mother was what the Epsom greengrocer called a carriage lady had no exchange value, apparently.
<p/>It had prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from getting educated, because the only education she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could have afforded was education with the Earlscourt green grocer's daughter.
<p/>It had led her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to seek the society of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother's class; and that class simply would not have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was much poorer than the greengrocer, and, far from being able to afford a maid, could not afford even a housemaid, and had to scrape along at home with an illiberally treated general servant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) was growing desperate. Under such circumstances nothing could give her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) an air of being a genuine product of Largelady Park.
<p/>And yet its tradition made her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) regard a marriage with anyone within her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) reach as an unbearable humiliation. Commercial people and professional people in a small way were odious to her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) ran after painters and novelists; but she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) did not charm them; and her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) bold attempts to pick up and practise artistic and literary talk irritated them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) was, in short, an utter failure, an ignorant, incompetent, pretentious, unwelcome, penniless, useless little snob; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) did not admit these disqualifications -LRB-for nobody ever faces unpleasant truths of this kind until the possibility of a way out dawns on them-RRB-
<p/>Clara had a startling eyeopener when, on being suddenly wakened to enthusiasm by a girl of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) own age who dazzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) and produced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) a gushing desire to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) for a model, and gain her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) friendship, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) discovered that this exquisite apparition had graduated from the gutter in a few months' time.
<p/>It shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) so violently, that when Mr. H. G. Wells lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) on the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) puissant pen, and placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) at the angle of view from which the life she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was leading and the society to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) clung appeared in its true relation to real human needs and worthy social structure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) effected a conversion and a conviction of sin comparable to the most sensational feats of General Booth or Gypsy Smith.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) felt their effects too keenly to be satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) position. Clara's snobbery went bang. Life suddenly began to move with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
<p/>Some of the acquaintances to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had been a tedious or indifferent or ridiculous affliction, dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>): others became cordial.
<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) amazement she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) found that some <div class="bookquote">``quite nice''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>people were saturated with Wells, and that this accessibility to ideas was the secret of their niceness.
<p/>People she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had thought deeply religious, and had tried to conciliate on that tack with disastrous results, suddenly took an interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), and revealed a hostility to conventional religion which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had never conceived possible except among the most desperate characters.
<p/>Without knowing how or why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) began to make friends and enemies. They made her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) read Galsworthy; and Galsworthy exposed the vanity of Largelady Park and finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
<p/>It exasperated her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to think that the dungeon in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had languished for so many unhappy years had been unlocked all the time, and that the impulses she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had so carefully struggled with and stifled for the sake of keeping well with society, were precisely those by which alone she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could have come into any sort of sincere human contact.
<p/>In the radiance of these discoveries, and the tumult of their reaction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) made a fool of herself as freely and conspicuously as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) so rashly adopted Eliza's expletive in Mrs. Higgins's drawing-room; for the new-born Wellsian had to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) bearings almost as ridiculously as a baby; but nobody hates a baby for its ineptitudes, or thinks the worse of it for trying to eat the matches; and Clara lost no friends by her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) follies.
<p/>They laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) face this time; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had to defend herself and fight it out as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) could.
<p/>When Freddy paid a visit to Earlscourt -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) never did when he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) could possibly help it-RRB- to make the desolating announcement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) Eliza were thinking of blackening the Largelady scutcheon by opening a shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) found the little household already convulsed by a prior announcement from Clara that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) also was going to work in an old furniture shop in Dover Street, which had been started by a fellow Wellsian.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) mind that, cost what it might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) would see Mr. Wells in the flesh; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had achieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) end at a garden party.
<p/>This appointment Clara owed, after all, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) old social accomplishment of Push. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had better luck than so rash an enterprise deserved.
<p/>Mr. Wells came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) expectations. Age had not withered him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>), nor could custom stale his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) infinite variety in half an hour.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) pleasant neatness and compactness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) small hands and feet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) teeming ready brain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) unaffected accessibility, and a certain fine apprehensiveness which stamped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) as susceptible from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) topmost hair to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>) tipmost toe, proved irresistible.
<p/>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) happened to talk to the lady of the furniture shop, and that lady also desired above all things to know Mr. Wells and sell pretty things to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wells</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) offered Clara a job on the chance of achieving that end through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>Clara talked of nothing else for weeks and weeks afterwards. And so it came about that Eliza's luck held, and the expected opposition to the flower shop melted away.
<p/>The shop is in the arcade of a railway station not very far from the Victoria and Albert Museum; and if you live in that neighborhood you may go there any day and buy a buttonhole from Eliza.
<p/>Would you not like to be assured that the shop was an immense success, thanks to Eliza's charms and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) early business experience in Covent Garden?
<p/>the truth is the truth: the shop did not pay for a long time, simply because Eliza and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) Freddy did not know how to keep it.
<p/>True, Eliza had not to begin at the very beginning: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) knew the names and prices of the cheaper flowers; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) elation was unbounded when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) found that Freddy, like all youths educated at cheap, pretentious, and thoroughly inefficient schools, knew a little Latin.
<p/>It was very little, but enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) appear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) a Porson or Bentley, and to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) ease with botanical nomenclature.
<p/>Unfortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) knew nothing else; and Eliza, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) could count money up to eighteen shillings or so, and had acquired a certain familiarity with the language of Milton from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) struggles to qualify herself for winning Higgins's bet, could not write out a bill without utterly disgracing the establishment.
<p/>Freddy's power of stating in Latin that Balbus built a wall and that Gaul was divided into three parts did not carry with it the slightest knowledge of accounts or business:
<p/>Now here is a last opportunity for romance. Alas! Colonel Pickering had to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pickering</b></font>) what a cheque book and a bank account meant.
<p/>Freddy backed up Eliza in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) obstinate refusal to believe that they could save money by engaging a bookkeeper with some knowledge of the business.
<p/>How, they argued, could you possibly save money by going to extra expense when you already could not make both ends meet?
<p/>But the Colonel, after making the ends meet over and over again, at last gently insisted; and Eliza, humbled to the dust by having to beg from him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) so often, and stung by the uproarious derision of Higgins, to whom the notion of Freddy succeeding at anything was a joke that never palled, grasped the fact that business, like phonetics, has to be learned.
<p/>On the piteous spectacle of the pair spending their evenings in shorthand schools and polytechnic classes, learning bookkeeping and typewriting with incipient junior clerks, male and female, from the elementary schools, let me not dwell.
<p/>There were even classes at the London School of Economics, and a humble personal appeal to the director of that institution to recommend a course bearing on the flower business.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>), being a humorist, explained to them the method of the celebrated Dickensian essay on Chinese Metaphysics by the gentleman who read an article on China and an article on Metaphysics and combined the information.
<p/>And the pair were by no means easily teachable. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) suggested that they should combine the London School with Kew Gardens.
<p/>Eliza, to whom the procedure of the Dickensian gentleman seemed perfectly correct -LRB-as in fact it was-RRB- and not in the least funny -LRB-which was only her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) ignorance-RRB- took his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) advice with entire gravity.
<p/>But the effort that cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) the deepest humiliation was a request to Higgins, whose pet artistic fancy, next to Milton's verse, was calligraphy, and who himself wrote a most beautiful Italian hand, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) would teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) to write.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was congenitally incapable of forming a single letter worthy of the least of Milton's words; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) persisted; and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) suddenly threw himself into the task of teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) with a combination of stormy intensity, concentrated patience, and occasional bursts of interesting disquisition on the beauty and nobility, the august mission and destiny, of human handwriting.
<p/>Eliza ended by acquiring an extremely uncommercial script which was a positive extension of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) personal beauty, and spending three times as much on stationery as anyone else because certain qualities and shapes of paper became indispensable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) could not even address an envelope in the usual way because it made the margins all wrong. Their commercial school days were a period of disgrace and despair for the young couple.
<p/>At last they gave it up as hopeless, and shook the dust of the shorthand schools, and the polytechnics, and the London School of Economics from their feet for ever.
<p/>They seemed to be learning nothing about flower shops. Besides, the business was in some mysterious way beginning to take care of itself.
<p/>They came to the conclusion that their own way was the best, and that they had really a remarkable talent for business.
<p/>The Colonel, who had been compelled for some years to keep a sufficient sum on current account at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) bankers to make up their deficits, found that the provision was unnecessary: the young people were prospering.
<p/>They had somehow forgotten their objections to employing other people. It is true that there was not quite fair play between them and their competitors in trade.
<p/>Their week-ends in the country cost them nothing, and saved them the price of their Sunday dinners; for the motor car was the Colonel's; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) and Higgins paid the hotel bills.
<p/>Mr. F. Hill, florist and greengrocer -LRB-they soon discovered that there was money in asparagus; and asparagus led to other vegetables-RRB-, had an air which stamped the business as classy; and in private life he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was still Frederick Eynsford Hill, Esquire.
<p/>Not that there was any swank about him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>): nobody but Eliza knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) had been christened Frederick Challoner. Eliza herself swanked like anything.
<p/>It is astonishing how much Eliza still manages to meddle in the housekeeping at Wimpole Street in spite of the shop and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own family.
<p/>And it is notable that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) never nags her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband, and frankly loves the Colonel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) were his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) favorite daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) has never got out of the habit of nagging Higgins that was established on the fatal night when she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) won his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) bet for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).
<p/>That is all. That is how it has turned out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) snaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) head off on the faintest provocation, or on none.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) storms and bullies and derides; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) stands up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) so ruthlessly that the Colonel has to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) from time to time to be kinder to Higgins; and it is the only request of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) that brings a mulish expression into her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) face.
<p/>Nothing but some emergency or calamity great enough to break down all likes and dislikes, and throw them both back on their common humanity--and may they be spared any such trial!--will
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) no longer dares to tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) by assuming an abysmal inferiority of Freddy's mind to his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) own. ever alter this.
<p/>The very scrupulousness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) that day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) had become used to having her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) there, and dependent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) for all sorts of little services, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) should miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) went away -LRB-it would never have occurred to Freddy or the Colonel to say anything of the sort-RRB- deepens her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) inner certainty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``no more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) than them slippers'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) has a sense, too, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) indifference is deeper than the infatuation of commoner souls.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) knows that Higgins does not need her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>), just as her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) father did not need her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) is immensely interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) has even secret mischievous moments in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) could get him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) alone, on a desert island, away from all ties and with nobody else in the world to consider, and just drag him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pedestal and see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) making love like any common man.
<p/>But when it comes to business, to the life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) really leads as distinguished from the life of dreams and fancies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) likes Freddy and she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) likes the Colonel; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) does not like Higgins and Mr. Doolittle.
<p/>We all have private imaginations of that sort. Galatea never does quite like Pygmalion: his (<font color='blue'><b>Doolittle</b></font>) relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) is too godlike to be altogether agreeable.
