the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ russian бра тья карама зовы brat ya karamazovy pronounced also translated as the $alyosha_karamazov$ brothers is the final novel by the russian #author# $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ dostoevsky
dostoevsky spent nearly two years writing the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ which was published as serial in the russian messenger from january to november
the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ is passionate philosophical novel set in century russia that enters deeply into the ethical debates of god free will and morality
it is spiritual drama of moral struggles concerning #faith# doubt judgment and #reason# set against modernizing russia with plot which revolves around the subject of patricide
dostoevsky died less than four months after its publication dostoevsky composed much of the novel in staraya russa which inspired the main setting
since its publication it has been acclaimed as one of the supreme achievements in world literature optina monastery served as spiritual center for russia in the century and inspired many aspects of the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$
he would incorporate some elements into his future work particularly from the planned epos the life of great sinner which he began work on in the summer of
it eventually remained unfinished after dostoevsky was interested in the nechayev affair which involved group of radicals murdering one of their former members
although dostoevsky began his first notes for the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ in april he had written several unfinished works years earlier he picked up that story and started with demons
the unfinished drama in tobolsk драма тобольске is considered the first draft of the first chapter of the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$
dated september it tells of fictional murder in staraya russa committed by praporshchik named dmitry ilynskov based on real soldier from omsk who is thought to have murdered his $father_zossima$
it goes on noting that his body was suddenly discovered in pit under house the similarly unfinished sorokoviny сороковины dated august is reflected in #book# ix chapter and #book# xi chapter nine
in the october writer diary article to the reader dostoevsky mentioned literary work that has imperceptibly and involuntarily been taking shape within me over these two years of publishing the diary
his diary collection of numerous articles had included similar themes the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ would later borrow from these include patricide law and order and social problems
although dostoevsky was influenced by religion and philosophy in his life and the writing of the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ personal tragedy altered the work
the novelist grief is apparent throughout the #book# dostoevsky named the hero $alyosha_karamazov$ as well as imbuing him with qualities which he sought and most admired
in may dostoevsky three year old son $alyosha_karamazov$ died of epilepsy condition inherited from his $father_zossima$ his loss is also reflected in the story of captain $snegiryov$ and his young son ilyusha
crime and punishment and dostoevsky later final masterpiece the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ are alike in one key respect they place the reader inside the mind of criminal
there he found inspiration for several aspects of the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ though at the #time# he intended to write novel about childhood instead
parts of the biographical section of zosima life are based on the life of the elder leonid text he found at optina and copied almost word for word
the death of his son brought dostoevsky to the optina monastery later that year dostoyevsky notes for chapter of the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$
although written in the century the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ displays number of modern elements dostoevsky composed the #book# with variety of literary techniques
though privy to many of the thoughts and #feeling# of the protagonists the narrator is self proclaimed writer he discusses his own mannerisms and personal perceptions so often in the novel that he becomes character
through his descriptions the narrator voice merges imperceptibly into the tone of the #people# he is describing often extending into the characters most personal thoughts
there is no voice of authority in the story see mikhail bakhtin problems of dostoevsky poetics for more on the relationship between dostoevsky and his characters
in addition to the principal narrator there are several sections narrated by other characters entirely such as the story of the grand inquisitor and zosima confessions
this technique enhances the theme of truth making many aspects of the tale completely subjective dostoevsky uses individual styles of speech to express the inner personality of each #person#
for example the attorney fetyukovich based on vladimir spasovich is characterized by malapropisms g robbed for tolen and at one point declares possible suspects in the murder irresponsible rather than innocent
for example the narrative in #book# six is almost entirely devoted to zosima biography which contains confession from #man# whom he met many years before
dostoevsky does not rely on single source or group of major characters to convey the themes of this #book# but uses variety of viewpoints narratives and characters throughout
although the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ has been translated from the original russian into number of languages the novel diverse array of distinct voices and literary techniques makes its translation difficult
several plot digressions provide insight into other apparently minor characters constance garnett performed the first english translation which was released in
in david magarshack and manuel komroff released translations of the novel published respectively by penguin and the new american library of world literature
in ralph matlaw thoroughly revised garnett work for his norton critical edition volume this in turn was the basis for victor terras influential $alyosha_karamazov$ companion
in $richard$ pevear and larissa volokhonsky released new translation it won pen #book# of the month club translation prize in and garnered positive reviews from the new york #time# #book# review and the dostoevsky scholar joseph frank who praised it for being the most faithful to dostoevsky original russian
in the oxford guide to literature in english translations academic peter france writes in regard to constance garnett translations translations read easily the basic meaning of the russian text is accurately rendered on the whole
it is true as critics such as nikoliukin have demonstrated that she shortens and simplifies muting dostoevsky jarring contrasts sacrificing his insistent rhythms and repetitions toning down the russian colouring explaining and normalizing in all #kind# of ways
garnett shortens some of dostoevsky idiosyncrasy in order to produce an acceptable english text but #her# versions were in many cases pioneering versions decorous they may be but they allowed this strange new voice to invade english literature and thus made it possible for later translators to go further in the search for more authentic voice
another popular translation is by julius katzer published by progress publishers in and later re printed by raduga publishers moscow on david magarshack dostoevsky translations france says it is not certain that magarshack has worn as well as garnett
he certainly corrects some of #her# errors he also aims for more up to date #style# which flows more easily in english
on macandrew american version he comments he translates fairly freely altering details rearranging shortening and explaining the russian to produce texts which lack distinctive voice
being even more thoroughly englished than garnett magarshack translations lack some of the excitement of the foreign on david mcduff penguin translation mcduff carries this literalism the furthest of any of the translators
in his brothers $alyosha_karamazov$ the odd fussy tone of the narrator is well rendered in the preface at #time# indeed the convoluted #style# might make the reader unfamiliar with dostoevsky russian question the translator command of english
more seriously this literalism means that the dialogue is sometimes impossibly odd and as result rather dead such foreignizing fidelity makes for difficult reading
on the pevear and volokhonsky translation france writes pevear and volokhonsky while they too stress the need to exhume the real rough edged dostoevsky from the normalization practised by earlier translators generally offers rather more satisfactory compromise between the literal and the readable
elsewhere it has to be said the desire to replicate the vocabulary or syntax of the russian results in unnecessary awkwardness and obscurity
in commenting on ignat avsey translation he writes his not entirely unprecedented choice of more natural sounding english formulation is symptomatic of his general desire to make his text english
in particular their rendering of dialogue is often livelier and more colloquial than mcduff his is an enjoyable version in the domesticating tradition
an acute accent marks the stressed syllable $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ pavlovich $alyosha_karamazov$ is the $father_zossima$ year old sponger and buffoon who sires three sons during his two #marriage#
$fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ takes no interest in any of his sons who are as result raised apart from each other and their $father_zossima$
he is rumored to have fathered an illegitimate son pavel fyodorovich $smerdyakov$ whom he employs as his servant the relationship between $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ and his adult sons drives much of the plot in the novel

he says to $alyosha_karamazov$ in the chapter rebellion bk it not god that dont accept $alyosha_karamazov$ only most respectfully return him the ticket
from an early age $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ is sullen and isolated his $father_zossima$ tells $alyosha_karamazov$ that he fears $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ more than $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$
some of the most memorable and acclaimed passages of the novel involve $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ including the chapter rebellion his poem the grand inquisitor immediately following and his nightmare of the devil bk
$ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ relationship with his $father_zossima$ and brothers is rather superficial in the beginning he is almost repulsed by his $father_zossima$ and had no positive affection towards $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$

the narrator identifies him as the hero of the novel in the opening chapter as does the #author# in the preface
he is described as immensely likable at the outset of the events $alyosha_karamazov$ is novice in the local russian orthodox monastery
his #faith# is in contrast to his brother $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ atheism his elder $father_zossima$ zosima sends him into the world where he becomes involved in the sordid details of his family
pavel fyodorovich $smerdyakov$ widely rumored to be the illegitimate son of $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ is the son of reeking $lizaveta$ mute woman of the street who died in childbirth
in secondary plotline $alyosha_karamazov$ befriends group of school boys whose fate adds hopeful message to the conclusion of the novel his name $smerdyakov$ means son of the reeking one
he was brought up by $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ trusted servant $grigory_vassilyevitch$ vasilievich kutuzov and his wife marfa $smerdyakov$ grows up in the $alyosha_karamazov$ house as servant working as $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ lackey and cook
he is morose and sullen and like dostoevsky suffers from epilepsy the narrator notes that as #child# $smerdyakov$ collected stray cats to hang and bury them
generally aloof $smerdyakov$ admires $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and shares his atheism $grushenka$ grusha grushka beautiful year old is the local jezebel and has an uncanny charm for #man#
in #her# youth she was jilted by polish officer and subsequently came under the protection of tyrannical miser the episode leaves $grushenka$ with an urge for independence and control of #her# life
$grushenka$ inspires complete admiration and lust in both $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ and $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ their rivalry for #her# affection is one of the most damaging factors in their relationship
$grushenka$ seeks to torment and then deride both $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ as wicked amusement way to inflict upon others the pain she has felt at the hands of #her# former and indisputable one
however after she begins friendship with $alyosha_karamazov$ and as the #book# progresses she begins to tread path of spiritual redemption through which emerges hidden qualities of gentleness and #generosity# though #her# fiery #temper# and #pride# are ever present
#her# engagement to $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ is chiefly matter of #pride# on both their parts $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ having bailed #her# $father_zossima$ out of debt
$katya$ katka katenka is $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ beautiful fiancée despite his open forays with $grushenka$ $katerina_ivanovna$ is extremely proud and seeks to act as noble martyr suffering as stark reminder of everyone guilt
because of this she cannot bring herself to act on #her# #love# for $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and constantly creates moral barriers between him and herself
by the end of the novel she too begins real and sincere spiritual redemption as seen in the epilogue when she asks $mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov$ and $grushenka$ to forgive #her#
$father_zossima$ zosima the elder $father_zossima$ zosima is an elder and spiritual advisor starets in the town monastery and $alyosha_karamazov$ teacher he is something of celebrity among the townspeople for his reputed prophetic and healing abilities
his popularity inspires both admiration and jealousy amidst his fellow monks zosima provides refutation to $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ atheistic arguments and helps to explain $alyosha_karamazov$ character
zosima teachings shape the way $alyosha_karamazov$ deals with the young boys he meets in the ilyusha storyline the character of $father_zossima$ zosima was to some extent inspired by that of saint tikhon of zadonsk
ilyusha ilyushechka or simply $ilusha$ in some translations is one of the local schoolboys and the central figure of crucial subplot in the novel
his $father_zossima$ captain $snegiryov$ is an impoverished officer who is insulted by $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ after $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ hires him to threaten the latter over his debts and the $snegiryov$ family is brought to shame as result
the reader is led to believe that it is partly because of this that ilyusha falls ill possibly to illustrate the theme that even minor actions can touch heavily on the lives of others and that we are all responsible for one another
the opening of the novel introduces the $alyosha_karamazov$ family and relates the story of their distant and recent past the details of $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ two #marriage# as well as his indifference to the upbringing of his three #child# is chronicled
the narrator also establishes the widely varying personalities of the three brothers and the circumstances that have led to their return to $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ town
#book# two begins as the $alyosha_karamazov$ family arrives at the local monastery so that the elder zosima can act as mediator between $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and his $father_zossima$ $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ in their dispute over $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ inheritance
it was the $father_zossima$ idea apparently as joke to have the meeting take place in such holy place in the presence of the famous elder
the first #book# concludes by describing the mysterious religious order of elders to which $alyosha_karamazov$ has become devoted $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ arrives late and the gathering soon degenerates and only exacerbates the feud between $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$
this #book# also contains scene in which the elder zosima consoles woman mourning the death of #her# three year old son
the poor woman grief parallels dostoyevsky own tragedy at the loss of his young son $alyosha_karamazov$ an original page of #book# chapter of the brothers $alyosha_karamazov$
$dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ personality is explored in the #conversation# between him and $alyosha_karamazov$ as $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ hides near his $father_zossima$ home to see if $grushenka$ will arrive
later that #evening# $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ bursts into his $father_zossima$ house and assaults him while threatening to come back and kill him in the future
the third #book# provides more details of the #love# triangle that has erupted between $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ his son $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and $grushenka$ this #book# also introduces $smerdyakov$ and his origins as well as the story of his mother reeking $lizaveta$
at the conclusion of this #book# $alyosha_karamazov$ is witness to $grushenka$ bitter humiliation of $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ betrothed $katerina_ivanovna$ resulting in terrible embarrassment and scandal for this proud woman
this section introduces side story which resurfaces in more detail later in the novel it begins with $alyosha_karamazov$ observing group of schoolboys throwing rocks at one of their sickly peers named ilyusha
it is later learned that ilyusha $father_zossima$ former staff captain named $snegiryov$ was assaulted by $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ who dragged him by the beard out of bar
$alyosha_karamazov$ soon learns of the further hardships present in the $snegiryov$ household and offers the former staff captain money as an apology for his brother and to help $snegiryov$ ailing wife and #child#
after initially accepting the money with joy $snegiryov$ throws the money back at $alyosha_karamazov$ out of #pride# and runs back into his home
here the rationalist and nihilistic ideology that permeated russia at this #time# is defended and espoused passionately by $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ while meeting his brother $alyosha_karamazov$ at restaurant
in the chapter titled rebellion $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ proclaims that he rejects the world that god has created because it is built on foundation of suffering
in perhaps the most famous chapter in the novel the grand inquisitor $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ narrates to $alyosha_karamazov$ his imagined poem that describes leader from the spanish inquisition and his encounter with jesus who has made his return to earth
the opposition between #reason# and #faith# is dramatised and symbolised in forceful monologue of the grand inquisitor who having ordered jesus arrested visits him in prison at night
when $alyosha_karamazov$ admonishes the boys and tries to help ilyusha bites $alyosha_karamazov$ finger for thou hast come to hinder us and thou knowest that
but with him we took from him what thou #didst# reject with scorn that last gift he offered thee showing thee all the kingdoms of the earth
we are working not with thee we took from him rome and the sword of caesar and proclaimed ourselves sole rulers of the earth
we shall triumph and shall be caesars and then we shall plan the universal happiness of #man# the grand inquisitor accuses jesus of having inflicted on humankind the burden of free will
at the end of all these arguments jesus silently steps forward and kisses the old #man# on his lips the grand inquisitor stunned and moved tells him he must never come there again and lets him out
$alyosha_karamazov$ after hearing this story goes to $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and kisses him softly with an unexplainable emotion on the lips $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ shouts with delight because $alyosha_karamazov$ gesture is taken directly from his poem
the sixth #book# relates the life and #history# of the elder zosima as he lies near death in his cell zosima explains he found his #faith# in his rebellious youth in the middle of duel consequently deciding to become monk
zosima preaches #people# must forgive others by acknowledging their own sins and guilt before others he explains that no sin is isolated making everyone responsible for their neighbor sins
zosima represents philosophy that responds to $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ which had challenged god creation in the previous #book# the #book# begins immediately following the death of zosima
it is commonly held perception in the town and the monastery as well that true holy #man# bodies are incorrupt i they do not succumb to putrefaction
it comes as great shock to the entire town that zosima body not only decays but begins the process almost immediately following his death
thus the expectation concerning the elder zosima is that his deceased body will not decompose within the first #day# the smell of zosima body is already unbearable
$alyosha_karamazov$ is particularly devastated by the sullying of zosima name due to #nothing# more than the corruption of his dead body
for many this calls into question their previous respect and admiration for zosima one of $alyosha_karamazov$ companions in the monastery named $mr_rakitin$ uses $alyosha_karamazov$ vulnerability to set up meeting between him and $grushenka$
however instead of $alyosha_karamazov$ becoming corrupted he is able to earn fresh #faith# and hope from $grushenka$ while $grushenka$ troubled mind begins the path of spiritual redemption through his influence they become close friends
the #book# ends with the spiritual regeneration of $alyosha_karamazov$ as he embraces kisses the earth outside the monastery echoing perhaps zosima last earthly act before his death and cries convulsively until finally going back out into the world as zosima instructed renewed
$dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ owes money to his fiancée $katerina_ivanovna$ and will believe himself to be thief if he does not find the money to pay #her# back before embarking on his quest for $grushenka$
this section deals primarily with $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ wild and distraught pursuit of money so he can run away with $grushenka$ this mad dash for money takes $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ from $grushenka$ benefactor to neighboring town on fabricated promise of business deal
all the while $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ is petrified that $grushenka$ may go to his $father_zossima$ $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ and marry him because he already has the monetary means to satisfy #her#
when $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ returns from his failed dealing in the neighboring town he escorts $grushenka$ to #her# benefactor home but quickly discovers she deceived him and left early
furious he runs to his $father_zossima$ home with brass pestle in his hand and spies on him from the window he takes the pestle from his pocket
then there is discontinuity in the action and $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ is suddenly running away off his $father_zossima$ property knocking the servant gregory in the head with the pestle with seemingly fatal results
$dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ is next seen in daze on the street covered in blood with pile of money in his hand he soon learns that $grushenka$ former betrothed has returned and taken #her# to lodge near where $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ just was
upon learning this $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ loads cart full of food and wine and pays for huge orgy to finally confront $grushenka$ in the presence of #her# old flame intending all the while to kill himself at dawn
when his deception is revealed he flees and $grushenka$ soon reveals to $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ that she really is in #love# with him
the party rages on and just as $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and $grushenka$ are making plans to marry the police enter the lodge and inform $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ that he is under arrest for the murder of his $father_zossima$
#book# nine introduces the details of $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ murder and describes the interrogation of $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ as he is questioned for the crime he maintains he did not commit
the first and rightful lover however is boorish pole who cheats the party at game of cards the alleged motive for the crime is robbery
$dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ was known to have been completely destitute earlier that #evening# but is suddenly seen on the street with thousands of rubles shortly after his $father_zossima$ murder
$dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ explains that the money he spent that #evening# came from three thousand rubles $katerina_ivanovna$ gave him to send to #her# sister
he spent half that at his first meeting with $grushenka$ another drunken orgy and sewed up the rest in cloth intending to give it back to $katerina_ivanovna$ in the name of honor he says
meanwhile the three thousand rubles that $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ had set aside for $grushenka$ has disappeared the lawyers are not convinced by this
all of the evidence points against $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ the only other #person# in the house at the #time# of the murder was $smerdyakov$ who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure he apparently suffered the #day# before
as result of the overwhelming evidence against him $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ is formally charged with the patricide and taken away to prison to await trial
boys continues the story of the schoolboys and ilyusha last referred to in #book# four the #book# begins with the introduction of the young boy $kolya_krassotkin$ krasotkin
he seems destined to follow in the spiritual footsteps of $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ dostoyevsky uses $kolya_krassotkin$ beliefs especially in #conversation# with $alyosha_karamazov$ to poke fun at his westernizer critics by putting their beliefs in what appears to be young boy who doesnt exactly know what he is talking about
$kolya_krassotkin$ is brilliant boy who proclaims his atheism socialism and beliefs in the ideas of europe $kolya_krassotkin$ is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself in danger
as part of prank $kolya_krassotkin$ lies between railroad tracks as train passes over and becomes something of legend for the feat
since the narrative left ilyusha in #book# four his illness has progressively worsened and the doctor states that he will not recover
$kolya_krassotkin$ and ilyusha had falling out over ilyusha maltreatment of dog ilyusha had fed it bread in which there was pin on $smerdyakov$ suggestion
but thanks to $alyosha_karamazov$ intervention the other schoolboys have gradually reconciled with ilyusha and $kolya_krassotkin$ soon joins them at his bedside
all the other boys look up to $kolya_krassotkin$ especially ilyusha it is here that $kolya_krassotkin$ first meets $alyosha_karamazov$ and begins to reassess his nihilist beliefs
it is in this #book# that $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ meets three #time# with $smerdyakov$ the final meeting culminating in $smerdyakov$ dramatic confession that he had faked the fit murdered $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ and stolen the money which he presents to $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$
#book# eleven chronicles $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ destructive influence on those around him and his descent into madness $smerdyakov$ expresses disbelief at $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ professed ignorance and surprise
$smerdyakov$ claims that $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ was complicit in the murder by telling $smerdyakov$ when he would be leaving $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$ house and more importantly by instilling in $smerdyakov$ the belief that in world without god everything is permitted
the #book# ends with $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ having hallucination in which he is visited by the devil who torments $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ by mocking his beliefs
$alyosha_karamazov$ finds $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ raving and informs him that $smerdyakov$ killed himself shortly after their final meeting this #book# details the trial of $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ $alyosha_karamazov$ for the murder of his $father_zossima$ $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$
the #man# in the crowd are presented as resentful and spiteful and the women are irrationally drawn to the romanticism of $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ #love# triangle with $katerina_ivanovna$ and $grushenka$
$ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ madness takes its final hold over him and he is carried away from the courtroom after recounting his final meeting with $smerdyakov$ and the aforementioned confession
impassioned by $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ illness which she believes is result of #her# assumed #love# for $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ she produces letter drunkenly written by $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ saying that he would kill $fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov$
the section concludes with the impassioned closing remarks of the prosecutor and the defense and the verdict that $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ is guilty
the final section opens with discussion of plan developed for $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ escape from his sentence of twenty years of hard labor in siberia
the courtroom drama is sharply satirized by dostoyevsky the turning point in the trial is $katerina_ivanovna$ damning testimony against $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ the plan is never fully described but it seems to involve $ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and $katerina_ivanovna$ bribing some guards
$alyosha_karamazov$ approves first because $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ is not emotionally ready to submit to such harsh sentence secondly because he is innocent and third because no guards or officers would suffer for aiding the escape
$dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ and $grushenka$ plan to escape to america and work the #land# there for several years and then to return to russia under assumed american names because they both cannot imagine living without russia
$dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ begs for $katerina_ivanovna$ to visit him in the hospital where he is recovering from an illness before he is due to be taken away
when she does $dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov$ apologizes for having hurt #her# she in turn apologizes for bringing up the implicating letter during the trial
they agree to #love# each other for that one moment and say they will #love# each other forever even though both now #love# other #people#
$alyosha_karamazov$ promises to remember $kolya_krassotkin$ ilyusha and all the boys and keep them close in his heart even though he will have to leave them and may not see them again until many years have passed
