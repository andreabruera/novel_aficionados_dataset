chapter i fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov was the third son of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov a land owner well known in our district in his own day and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death which happened thirteen years ago and which i shall describe in its proper place
for the present i will only say that this landowner for so we used to call him although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate was a strange type yet one pretty frequently to be met with a type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless
but he was one of those senseless person who are very well capable of looking after their worldly affairs and apparently after nothing else
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov for instance began with next to nothing his estate was of the smallest he ran to dine at other man tables and fastened on them as a toady yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard cash
ilusha funeral the speech at the stone footnotes part i book i the history of a family at the same time he was all his life one of the most senseless fantastical fellows in the whole district
i repeat it was not stupidity the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and intelligent enough but just senselessness and a peculiar national form of it
he was married twice and had three sons the eldest dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov by his first wife and two ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov by his second
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov first wife adelaďda_ivanovna belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble family also landowners in our district the miüsovs
how it came to pass that an heiress who was also a beauty and moreover one of those vigorous intelligent girls so common in this generation but sometimes also to be found in the last could have married such a worthless puny weakling as we all called him i wont attempt to explain
i knew a young lady of the last romantic generation who after some years of an enigmatic passion for a gentleman whom she might quite easily have married at any moment invented insuperable obstacles to their union and ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high bank almost a precipice and so perished entirely to satisfy her own caprice and to be like shakespeare ophelia
indeed if this precipice a chosen and favorite spot of her had been less picturesque if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place most likely the suicide would never have taken place
this is a fact and probably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or three generations
adelaďda_ivanovna pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov action was similarly no doubt an echo of other people ideas and was due to the irritation caused by lack of mental freedom
and a pliable imagination persuaded her we must suppose for a brief moment that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in spite of his parasitic position was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch though he was in fact an ill natured buffoon and nothing more
she wanted perhaps to show her feminine independence to override class distinctions and the despotism of her family what gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement and this greatly captivated adelaďda_ivanovna fancy
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov position at the time made him specially eager for any such enterprise for he was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another
as for mutual love it did not exist apparently either in the bride or in him in spite of adelaďda_ivanovna beauty
this was perhaps a unique case of the kind in the life of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who was always of a voluptuous temper and ready to run after any petticoat on the slightest encouragement
to attach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluring prospect she seems to have been the only woman who made no particular appeal to his senses
immediately after the elopement adelaďda_ivanovna discerned in a flash that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt the marriage accordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity
although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned the runaway bride her dowry the husband and wife began to lead a most disorderly life and there were everlasting scenes between them
it was said that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity than fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who as is now known got hold of all her money up to twenty five thousand roubles as soon as she received it so that those thousands were lost to her for ever
the little village and the rather fine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his utmost for a long time to transfer to his name by means of some deed of conveyance
he would probably have succeeded merely from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him and from the contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless importunity
it is known for a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife but rumor had it that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov did not beat his wife but was beaten by her for she was a hot tempered bold dark browed impatient woman possessed of remarkable physical strength
finally she left the house and ran away from fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov with a destitute divinity student leaving mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov a child of three years old in her husband hands
but fortunately adelaďda_ivanovna family intervened and circumvented his greediness immediately fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov introduced a regular harem into the house and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness
in the interval he used to drive all over the province complaining tearfully to each and all of adelaďda_ivanovna having left him going into details too disgraceful for a husband to mention in regard to his own married life
what seemed to gratify him and flatter his self love most was to play the ridiculous part of the injured husband and to parade his woes with embellishments
one would think that you got a promotion fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow scoffers said to him
many even added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon and that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position
but who knows it may have been simplicity at last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife
the poor woman turned out to be in petersburg where she had gone with her divinity student and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete emancipation
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov at once began bustling about making preparations to go to petersburg with what object he could not himself have said
he would perhaps have really gone but having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking
she had died quite suddenly in a garret according to one story of typhus or as another version had it of starvation
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was drunk when he heard of his wife death and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy raising his hands to heaven lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace but others say he wept without restraint like a little child so much so that people were sorry for him in spite of the repulsion he inspired
it is quite possible that both versions were true that he rejoiced at his release and at the same time wept for her who released him
and just at that time his wife family received the news of her death in petersburg as a general rule people even the wicked are much more naďve and simple hearted than we suppose
and we ourselves are too chapter ii he gets rid of his eldest son you can easily imagine what a father_zossima such a man could be and how he would bring up his child
he completely abandoned the child of his marriage with adelaďda_ivanovna not from malice nor because of his matrimonial grievances but simply because he forgot him
while he was wearying every one with his tears and complaints and turning his house into a sink of debauchery a faithful servant of the family grigory_vassilyevitch took the three year old mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov into his care
his behavior as a father_zossima was exactly what might be expected if he hadnt looked after him there would have been no one even to change the baby little shirt
his grandfather was no longer living his widow mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov grandmother had moved to moscow and was seriously ill while his daughters were married so that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov remained for almost a whole year in old grigory_vassilyevitch charge and lived with him in the servant cottage
but if his father_zossima had remembered him he could not indeed have been altogether unaware of his existence he would have sent him back to the cottage as the child would only have been in the way of his debauchery
it happened moreover that the child relations on his mother side forgot him too at first but a cousin of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mother pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov happened to return from paris
he lived for many years afterwards abroad but was at that time quite a young man and distinguished among the miüsovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of european culture who had been in the capitals and abroad
in the course of his career he had come into contact with many of the most liberal man of his epoch both in russia and abroad
he had known proudhon and bakunin personally and in his declining years was very fond of describing the three day of the paris revolution of february hinting that he himself had almost taken part in the fighting on the barricades
towards the end of his life he became a liberal of the type common in the forties and fifties this was one of the most grateful recollections of his youth
his splendid estate lay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the land of our famous monastery with which pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov began an endless lawsuit almost as soon as he came into the estate concerning the rights of fishing in the river or wood cutting in the forest i dont know exactly which
he regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man of culture to open an attack upon the clericals
hearing all about adelaďda_ivanovna whom he of course remembered and in whom he had at one time been interested and learning of the existence of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he intervened in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
he made the latter acquaintance for the first time and told him directly that he wished to undertake the child education
he used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch that when he began to speak of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov looked for some time as though he did not understand what child he was talking about and even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in the house
he had an independent property of about a thousand soul to reckon in the old style the story may have been exaggerated yet it must have been something like the truth
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was all his life fond of acting of suddenly playing an unexpected part sometimes without any motive for doing so and even to his own direct disadvantage as for instance in the present case
this habit however is characteristic of a very great number of people some of them very clever ones not like fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov carried the business through vigorously and was appointed with fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov joint guardian of the child who had a small property a house and land left him by his mother
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov did in fact pass into this cousin keeping but as the latter had no family of his own and after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once to paris he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins a lady living in moscow
it came to pass that settling permanently in paris he too forgot the child especially when the revolution of february broke out making an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of his life
the moscow lady died and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov passed into the care of one of her married daughters i believe he changed his home a fourth time later on
i wont enlarge upon that now as i shall have much to tell later of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov firstborn and must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him without which i could not begin my story
in the first place this mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov or rather dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was the only one of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov three sons who grew up in the belief that he had property and that he would be independent on coming of age
he did not finish his study at the gymnasium he got into a military school then went to the caucasus was promoted fought a duel and was degraded to the ranks earned promotion again led a wild life and spent a good deal of money
he did not begin to receive any income from fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov until he came of age and until then got into debt
he saw and knew his father_zossima fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov for the first time on coming of age when he visited our neighborhood on purpose to settle with him about his property
he did not stay long with him and made haste to get away having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money and entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate of the revenues and value of which he was unable a fact worthy of note upon this occasion to get a statement from his father_zossima
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov remarked for the first time then this too should be noted that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had a vague and exaggerated idea of his property
he spent an irregular boyhood and youth he seems not to have liked his father_zossima fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was very well satisfied with this as it fell in with his own design
he gathered only that the young man was frivolous unruly of violent passions impatient and dissipated and that if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied although only of course for a short time
in the end when four years later mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov losing patience came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his father_zossima it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing that it was difficult to get an account even that he had received the whole value of his property in sum of money from fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and was perhaps even in debt to him that by various agreements into which he had of his own desire entered at various previous dates he had no right to expect anything more and so on and so on
so fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov began to take advantage of this fact sending him from time to time small doles installments the young man was overwhelmed suspected deceit and cheating and was almost beside himself
and indeed this circumstance led to the catastrophe the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story or rather the external side of it
but before i pass to that story i must say a little of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov other two sons and of their origin
chapter iii the second marriage and the second family very shortly after getting his four year old mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov off his hands fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov married a second time
he took this second wife sofya ivanovna also a very young girl from another province where he had gone upon some small piece of business in company with a jew
though fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he never neglected investing his capital and managed his business affairs very successfully though no doubt not over scrupulously
his second marriage lasted eight years sofya ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon and was left from childhood an orphan without relations
she grew up in the house of a general widow a wealthy old lady of good position who was at once her benefactress and tormentor
i do not know the details but i have only heard that the orphan girl a meek and gentle creature was once cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in the loft so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old woman who was apparently not bad hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant through idleness
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov made her an offer inquiries were made about him and he was refused but again as in his first marriage he proposed an elopement to the orphan girl
there is very little doubt that she would not on any account have married him if she had known a little more about him in time
but she lived in another province besides what could a little girl of sixteen know about it except that she would be better at the bottom of the river than remaining with her benefactress
so the poor child exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov did not get a penny this time for the general widow was furious
but he had not reckoned on a dowry what allured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl above all her innocent appearance which had a peculiar attraction for a vicious profligate who had hitherto admired only the coarser types of feminine beauty
she gave them nothing and cursed them both those innocent eye slit my soul up like a razor he used to say afterwards with his loathsome snigger
as he had received no dowry with his wife and had so to speak taken her from the halter he did not stand on ceremony with her
making her feel that she had wronged him he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary decencies of marriage
in a man so depraved this might of course mean no more than sensual attraction he gathered loose women into his house and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife presence
to show what a pass things had come to i may mention that grigory_vassilyevitch the gloomy stupid obstinate argumentative servant who had always hated his first mistress adelaďda_ivanovna took the side of his new mistress
he championed her cause abusing fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in a manner little befitting a servant and on one occasion broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out of the house
in the end this unhappy young woman kept in terror from her childhood fell into that kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be possessed by devils
yet she bore fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov two sons ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second three years later
when she died little alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov was in his fourth year and strange as it seems i know that he remembered his mother all his life like a dream of course
at time after terrible fits of hysterics she even lost her reason at her death almost exactly the same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
they were looked after by the same grigory_vassilyevitch and lived in his cottage where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother
they were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father_zossima she was still alive and had not all those eight years forgotten the insult done her
all that time she was obtaining exact information as to her sofya manner of life and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she declared aloud two or three time to her retainers it serves her right
exactly three months after sofya ivanovna death the general widow suddenly appeared in our town and went straight to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov house
god has punished her for her ingratitude she spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal
the story is that instantly upon seeing him without any sort of explanation she gave him two good resounding slaps on the face seized him by a tuft of hair and shook him three time up and down
it was evening fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov whom she had not seen for those eight years came in to her drunk then without a word she went straight to the cottage to the two boys
seeing at the first glance that they were unwashed and in dirty linen she promptly gave grigory_vassilyevitch too a box on the ear and announcing that she would carry off both the child she wrapped them just as they were in a rug put them in the carriage and drove off to her own town
grigory_vassilyevitch accepted the blow like a devoted slave without a word and when he escorted the old lady to her carriage he made her a low bow and pronounced impressively that god would repay her for the orphans
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov thinking it over decided that it was a good thing and did not refuse the general widow his formal consent to any proposition in regard to his child education
you are a blockhead all the same the old lady shouted to him as she drove away as for the slaps she had given him he drove all over the town telling the story
it happened that the old lady died soon after this but she left the boys in her will a thousand roubles each for their instruction and so that all be spent on them exclusively with the condition that it be so portioned out as to last till they are twenty one for it is more than adequate provision for such child
if other people think fit to throw away their money let them i have not read the will myself but i heard there was something queer of the sort very whimsically expressed
the principal heir yefim_petrovitch_polenov the marshal of nobility of the province turned out however to be an honest man
writing to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and discerning at once that he could extract nothing from him for his child education though the latter never directly refused but only procrastinated as he always did in such cases and was indeed at time effusively sentimental yefim_petrovitch_polenov took a personal interest in the orphans
he became especially fond of the younger alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov who lived for a long while as one of his family i beg the reader to note this from the beginning
and to yefim_petrovitch_polenov a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to be met with the young people were more indebted for their education and bringing up than to any one
he kept the two thousand roubles left to them by the general widow intact so that by the time they came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation of interest
he educated them both at his own expense and certainly spent far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them
i wont enter into a detailed account of their boyhood and youth but will only mention a few of the most important events
of the elder ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i will only say that he grew into a somewhat morose and reserved though far from timid boy
at ten years old he had realized that they were living not in their own home but on other people charity and that their father_zossima was a man of whom it was disgraceful to speak
this boy began very early almost in his infancy so they say at least to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude for learning
i dont know precisely why but he left the family of yefim_petrovitch_polenov when he was hardly thirteen entering a moscow gymnasium and boarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher an old friend of yefim_petrovitch_polenov
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov used to declare afterwards that this was all due to the ardor for good works of yefim_petrovitch_polenov who was captivated by the idea that the boy genius should be trained by a teacher of genius
but neither yefim_petrovitch_polenov nor this teacher was living when the young man finished at the gymnasium and entered the university
as yefim_petrovitch_polenov had made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical old lady legacy which had grown from one thousand to two it was delayed owing to formalities inevitable in russia and the young man was in great straits for the first two years at the university as he was forced to keep himself all the time he was studying
it must be noted that he did not even attempt to communicate with his father_zossima perhaps from pride from contempt for him or perhaps from his cool common sense which told him that from such a father_zossima he would get no real assistance
however that may have been the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded in getting work at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards getting paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature of eye witness
this alone showed the young man practical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy and unfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the office of the newspapers and journals unable to think of anything better than everlasting entreaty for copying and translations from the french
having once got into touch with the editors ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov always kept up his connection with them and in his latter years at the university he published brilliant reviews of book upon various special subjects so that he became well known in literary circles
but only in his last year he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wider circle of readers so that a great many people noticed and remembered him
these paragraphs it was said were so interesting and piquant that they were soon taken it was rather a curious incident
when he had just left the university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov published in one of the more important journals a strange article which attracted general notice on a subject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing as he was a student of natural science
the article dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time the position of the ecclesiastical courts after discussing several opinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view
what was most striking about the article was its tone and its unexpected conclusion many of the church_of_christ party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side
and yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in their applause finally some sagacious person opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical burlesque
i mention this incident particularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood where the inmates being particularly interested in the question of the ecclesiastical courts were completely bewildered by it
learning the author name they were interested in his being a native of the town and the son of that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
and just then it was that the author himself made his appearance among us why ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had come amongst us
i remember asking myself at the time with a certain uneasiness this fateful visit which was the first step leading to so many consequences i never fully explained to myself
it seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned so proud and apparently so cautious should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father_zossima who had ignored him all his life hardly knew him never thought of him and would not under any circumstances have given him money though he was always afraid that his sons ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov would also come to ask him for it
and here the young man was staying in the house of such a father_zossima had been living with him for two months and they were on the best possible terms
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov of whom we have spoken already the cousin of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov first wife happened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate
this last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me he had come from paris which was his permanent home
i remember that he was more surprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the young man who interested him extremely and with whom he sometimes argued and not without an inner pang compared himself in acquirements
he is proud he used to say he will never be in want of pence he has got money enough to go abroad now
what does he want here every one can see that he hasnt come for money for his father_zossima would never give him any
he has no taste for drink and dissipation and yet his father_zossima cant do without him they get on so well together
that was the truth the young man had an unmistakable influence over his father_zossima who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and even seemed at time ready to obey his son though often extremely and even spitefully perverse
it was only later that we learned that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had come partly at the request of and in the interests of his elder brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov whom he saw for the first time on this very visit though he had before leaving moscow been in correspondence with him about an important matter of more concern to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov than himself
what that business was the reader will learn fully in due time yet even when i did know of this special circumstance
i may add that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov appeared at the time in the light of a mediator between his father_zossima and his elder brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov who was in open quarrel with his father_zossima and even planning to bring an action against him
the family i repeat was now united for the first time and some of its members met for the first time in their lives
i still felt ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to be an enigmatic figure and thought his visit rather mysterious the younger brother alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov had been a year already among us having been the first of the three to arrive
yet i must give some preliminary account of him if only to explain one queer fact which is that i have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice
yes he had been for the last year in our monastery and seemed willing to be cloistered there for the rest of his life
it is of that brother alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov i find it most difficult to speak in this introduction chapter iv the third son
alyosha_karamazov he was only twenty his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was in his twenty fourth year at the time while their elder brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was twenty seven
first of all i must explain that this young man alyosha_karamazov was not a fanatic and in my opinion at least was not even a mystic
he was simply an early lover of humanity and that he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him so to say as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love
and the reason this life struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time as he thought an extraordinary being our celebrated elder father_zossima to whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart
but i do not dispute that he was very strange even at that time and had been so indeed from his cradle
i have mentioned already by the way that though he lost his mother in his fourth year he remembered her all his life her face her caresses as though she stood living before me
such memories may persist as every one knows from an even earlier age even from two years old but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spot of light out of darkness like a corner torn out of a huge picture which has all faded and disappeared except that fragment
he remembered one still summer evening an open window the slanting rays of the setting sun that he recalled most vividly of all in a corner of the room the holy image before it a lighted lamp and on her knees before the image his mother sobbing hysterically with cries and moans snatching him up in both arms squeezing him close till it hurt and praying for him to the mother of god holding him out in both arms to the image as though to put him under the mother protection and suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her in terror
i may as well give my full opinion from the beginning that is how it was with him that was the picture
and alyosha_karamazov remembered his mother face at that minute he used to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered
in his childhood and youth he was by no means expansive and talked little indeed but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability quite the contrary from something different from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with other people but so important to him that he seemed as it were to forget others on account of it
but he was fond of people he seemed throughout his life to put implicit trust in people yet no one ever looked on him as a simpleton or naďve person
there was something about him which made one feel at once and it was so all his life afterwards that he did not care to be a judge of others that he would never take it upon himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything
he seemed indeed to accept everything without the least condemnation though often grieving bitterly and this was so much so that no one could surprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth
coming at twenty to his father_zossima house which was a very sink of filthy debauchery he chaste and pure as he was simply withdrew in silence when to look on was unbearable but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation
his father_zossima who had once been in a dependent position and so was sensitive and ready to take offense met him at first with distrust and sullenness
but he rarely cared to speak of this memory to any one he does not say much he used to say and thinks the more
but soon within a fortnight indeed he took to embracing him and kissing him terribly often with drunken tears with sottish sentimentality yet he evidently felt a real and deep affection for him such as he had never been capable of feeling for any one before
when he entered the household of his patron and benefactor yefim_petrovitch_polenov he gained the hearts of all the family so that they looked on him quite as their own child
yet he entered the house at such a tender age that he could not have acted from design nor artfulness in winning affection
so that the gift of making himself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him in his very nature so to speak
it was the same at school though he seemed to be just one of those child who are distrusted sometimes ridiculed and even disliked by their schoolfellows
every one indeed loved this young man wherever he went and it was so from his earliest childhood he was dreamy for instance and rather solitary
from his earliest childhood he was fond of creeping into a corner to read and yet he was a general favorite all the while he was at school
he was rarely playful or merry but any one could see at the first glance that this was not from any sullenness
perhaps because of this he was never afraid of any one yet the boys immediately understood that he was not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he was bold and courageous
on the contrary he was bright and good tempered he never tried to show off among his schoolfellows he never resented an insult
it would happen that an hour after the offense he would address the offender or answer some question with as trustful and candid an expression as though nothing had happened between them
and it was not that he seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront but simply that he did not regard it as an affront and this completely conquered and captivated the boys
he had one characteristic which made all his schoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want to mock at him not from malice
but because it amused them this characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity he could not bear to hear certain words and certain conversation about women
boys pure in mind and heart almost child are fond of talking in school among themselves and even aloud of things pictures and images of which even soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak
more than that much that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to quite young child of our intellectual and higher classes
there is no moral depravity no real corrupt inner cynicism in it but there is the appearance of it and it is often looked upon among them as something refined subtle daring and worthy of imitation
seeing that alyosha_karamazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of that they used sometimes to crowd round him pull his hands away and shout nastiness into both ears while he struggled slipped to the floor tried to hide himself without uttering one word of abuse enduring their insults in silence
but at last they left him alone and gave up taunting him with being a regular girl and what more they looked upon it with compassion as a weakness
there are certain words and conversation unhappily impossible to eradicate in schools he was always one of the best in the class but was never first
the inconsolable widow went almost immediately after his death for a long visit to italy with her whole family which consisted only of women and girls
alyosha_karamazov went to live in the house of two distant relations of yefim_petrovitch_polenov lady whom he had never seen before
at the time of yefim_petrovitch_polenov death alyosha_karamazov had two more years to complete at the provincial gymnasium on what terms he lived with them he did not know himself
in that respect he was a striking contrast to his elder brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov who struggled with poverty for his first two years in the university maintained himself by his own efforts and had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his benefactor
but this strange trait in alyosha_karamazov character must not i think be criticized too severely for at the slightest acquaintance with him any one would have perceived that alyosha_karamazov was one of those youths almost of the type of religious enthusiast who if they were suddenly to come into possession of a large fortune would not hesitate to give it away for the asking either for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue
it was very characteristic of him indeed that he never cared at whose expense he was living in general he seemed scarcely to know the value of money not of course in a literal sense
when he was given pocket money which he never asked for he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a moment or he kept it for weeks together not knowing what to do with it
in later years pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov a man very sensitive on the score of money and bourgeois honesty pronounced the following judgment after getting to know alyosha_karamazov
here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave alone without a penny in the center of an unknown town of a million inhabitants and he would not come to harm he would not die of cold and hunger for he would be fed and sheltered at once and if he were not he would find a shelter for himself and it would cost him no effort or humiliation
and to shelter him would be no burden but on the contrary would probably be looked on as a pleasure
a year before the end of the course he suddenly announced to the lady that he was going to see his father_zossima about a plan which had occurred to him
the journey was not an expensive one and the lady would not let him pawn his watch a parting present from his benefactor family
he did not finish his study at the gymnasium they were sorry and unwilling to let him go they provided him liberally with money and even fitted him out with new clothes and linen
on his arrival in the town he made no answer to his father_zossima first inquiry why he had come before completing his study and seemed so they say unusually thoughtful
but he returned half the money they gave him saying that he intended to go third class it soon became apparent that he was looking for his mother tomb
he practically acknowledged at the time that that was the only object of his visit but it can hardly have been the whole reason of it
it is more probable that he himself did not understand and could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his soul and drawn him irresistibly into a new unknown but inevitable path
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov could not show him where his second wife was buried for he had never visited her grave since he had thrown earth upon her coffin and in the course of years had entirely forgotten where she was buried
three or four years after his wife death he had gone to the south of russia and finally turned up in odessa where he spent several years
he made the acquaintance at first in his own words of a lot of low jews jewesses and jewkins and ended by being received by jews high and low alike
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov by the way had for some time previously not been living in our town it may be presumed that at this period he developed a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding money
he finally returned to our town only three years before alyosha_karamazov arrival his former acquaintances found him looking terribly aged although he was by no means an old man
he behaved not exactly with more dignity but with more effrontery the former buffoon showed an insolent propensity for making buffoons of others
his depravity with women was not simply what it used to be but even more revolting in a short time he opened a great number of new taverns in the district
many of the inhabitants of the town and district were soon in his debt and of course had given good security
of late too he looked somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible more uneven had sunk into a sort of incoherence used to begin one thing and go on with another as though he were letting himself go altogether
it was evident that he had perhaps a hundred thousand roubles or not much less he was more and more frequently drunk
and if it had not been for the same servant grigory_vassilyevitch who by that time had aged considerably too and used to look after him sometimes almost like a tutor fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov might have got into terrible scrapes
alyosha_karamazov arrival seemed to affect even his moral side as though something had awakened in this prematurely old man which had long been dead in his soul
do you know he used often to say looking at alyosha_karamazov that you are like her the crazy woman that was what he used to call his dead wife alyosha_karamazov mother
he took him to our town cemetery and showed him in a remote corner a cast iron tombstone cheap but decently kept on which were inscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date of her death and below a four lined verse such as are commonly used on old fashioned middle class tombs
grigory_vassilyevitch it was who pointed out the crazy woman grave to alyosha_karamazov to alyosha_karamazov amazement this tomb turned out to be grigory_vassilyevitch doing
he had put it up on the poor crazy woman grave at his own expense after fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov whom he had often pestered about the grave had gone to odessa abandoning the grave and all his memories
he only listened to grigory_vassilyevitch minute and solemn account of the erection of the tomb he stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering a word
alyosha_karamazov showed no particular emotion at the sight of his mother grave it was perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again
he suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to pay for requiems for the soul of his wife but not for the second alyosha_karamazov mother the crazy woman but for the first adelaďda_ivanovna who used to thrash him
but this little episode was not without an influence upon fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and a very original one in the evening of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks to alyosha_karamazov
he himself was far from being religious he had probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint
strange impulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types i have mentioned already that he looked bloated
besides the long fleshy bags under his little always insolent suspicious and ironical eye besides the multitude of deep wrinkles in his little fat face the adam apple hung below his sharp chin like a great fleshy goiter which gave him a peculiar repulsive sensual appearance add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips between which could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth
his countenance at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the life he had led he slobbered every time he began to speak
he was fond indeed of making fun of his own face though i believe he was well satisfied with it he used particularly to point to his nose which was not very large but very delicate and conspicuously aquiline
a regular roman nose he used to say with my goiter i ve quite the countenance of an ancient roman patrician of the decadent period
not long after visiting his mother grave alyosha_karamazov suddenly announced that he wanted to enter the monastery and that the monks were willing to receive him as a novice
he seemed proud of it he explained that this was his strong desire and that he was solemnly asking his consent as his father_zossima
the old man knew that the elder father_zossima who was living in the monastery hermitage had made a special impression upon his gentle boy
that is the most honest monk among them of course he observed after listening in thoughtful silence to alyosha_karamazov and seeming scarcely surprised at his request
he was half drunk and suddenly he grinned his slow half drunken grin which was not without a certain cunning and tipsy slyness
m so that where you want to be my gentle boy m i had a presentiment that you would end in something like this
would you believe it you were making straight for it well to be sure you have your own two thousand that a dowry for you
and i ll never desert you my angel and i ll pay what wanted for you there if they ask for it but of course if they dont ask why should we worry them
do you know that near one monastery there a place outside the town where every baby knows there are none but the monks wives living as they are called
what do you say you know you spend money like a canary two grains a week m thirty women i believe
i have been there myself you know it interesting in its own way of course as a variety the worst of it is it awfully russian
there are no french women there of course they could get them fast enough they have plenty of money if they get to hear of it they ll come along
well there nothing of that sort here no monks wives and two hundred monks they re honest they keep the fasts i admit it
h so you want to be a monk and do you know i sorry to lose you alyosha_karamazov would you believe it
i ve really grown fond of you well it a good opportunity you ll pray for us sinners we have sinned too much here
i ve always been thinking who would pray for me and whether there any one in the world to do it my dear boy i awfully stupid about that
you see however stupid i am about it i keep thinking i keep thinking from time to time of course not all the while
it impossible i think for the devils to forget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when i die
you wouldnt believe it awfully then i wonder hooks where would they get them what of iron hooks where do they forge them
have they a foundry there of some sort the monks in the monastery probably believe that there a ceiling in hell for instance
now i ready to believe in hell but without a ceiling it makes it more refined more enlightened more lutheran that is
and after all what does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasnt but do you know there a damnable question involved in it
if there no ceiling there can be no hooks and if there are no hooks it all breaks down which is unlikely again for then there would be none to drag me down to hell and if they dont drag me down what justice is there in the world
il faudrait les inventer those hooks on purpose for me alone for if you only knew alyosha_karamazov what a blackguard i am
but there are no hooks there said alyosha_karamazov looking gently and seriously at his father_zossima yes yes only the shadows of hooks i know i know
that how a frenchman described hell ai bu ombre un cocher qui avec ombre une brosse frottait ombre une carrosse
how do you know there are no hooks darling when you ve lived with the monks you ll sing a different tune but go and get at the truth there and then come and tell me
besides it will be more seemly for you with the monks than here with me with a drunken old man and young harlots though you re like an angel nothing touches you
anyway it easier going to the other world if one knows what there is there and i dare say nothing will touch you there
that why i let you go because i hope for that you ve got all your wits about you you will burn and you will burn out you will be healed and come back again
and i will wait for you i feel that you re the only creature in the world who has not condemned me
my dear boy i feel it you know i cant help feeling it and he even began blubbering he was sentimental
some of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly ecstatic poorly developed creature a pale consumptive dreamer
he was wicked and sentimental chapter elders on the contrary alyosha_karamazov was at this time a well grown red cheeked clear eyed lad of nineteen radiant with health
he was very handsome too graceful moderately tall with hair of a dark brown with a regular rather long oval shaped face and wide set dark gray shining eye he was very thoughtful and apparently very serene
i shall be told perhaps that red cheeks are not incompatible with fanaticism and mysticism but i fancy that alyosha_karamazov was more of a realist than any one
no doubt in the monastery he fully believed in miracles but to my thinking miracles are never a stumbling block to the realist
the genuine realist if he is an unbeliever will always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous and if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own senses than admit the fact
oh it is not miracles that dispose realists to belief even if he admits it he admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him
faith does not in the realist spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith if the realist once believes then he is bound by his very realism to admit the miraculous also
the apostle thomas said that he would not believe till he saw but when he did see he said my lord and my god
most likely not but he believed solely because he desired to believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart even when he said i do not believe till i see
was it the miracle forced him to believe i shall be told perhaps that alyosha_karamazov was stupid undeveloped had not finished his study and so on
that he did not finish his study is true but to say that he was stupid or dull would be a great injustice
he entered upon this path only because at that time it alone struck his imagination and presented itself to him as offering an ideal means of escape for his soul from darkness to light
add to that that he was to some extent a youth of our last epoch that is honest in nature desiring the truth seeking for it and believing in it and seeking to serve it at once with all the strength of his soul seeking for immediate action and ready to sacrifice everything life itself for it
though these young man unhappily fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is in many cases the easiest of all sacrifices and that to sacrifice for instance five or six years of their seething youth to hard and tedious study if only to multiply tenfold their powers of serving the truth and the cause they have set before them as their goal such a sacrifice is utterly beyond the strength of many of them
the path alyosha_karamazov chose was a path going in the opposite direction but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement
as soon as he reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of god and immortality and at once he instinctively said to himself i want to live for immortality and i will accept no compromise
in the same way if he had decided that god and immortality did not exist he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist
for socialism is not merely the labor question it is before all things the atheistic question the question of the form taken by atheism to day the question of the tower of babel built without god not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth
i ll simply repeat what i have said above alyosha_karamazov would have found it strange and impossible to go on living as before
alyosha_karamazov said to himself i cant give two roubles instead of all and only go to mass instead of following him
it is written give all that thou hast to the poor and follow me if thou wouldst be perfect perhaps his memories of childhood brought back our monastery to which his mother may have taken him to mass
perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which his poor crazy mother had held him up still acted upon his imagination
brooding on these things he may have come to us perhaps only to see whether here he could sacrifice all or only two roubles and in the monastery he met this elder
i must digress to explain what an elder is in russian monasteries and i am sorry that i do not feel very competent to do so
authorities on the subject assert that the institution of elders is of recent date not more than a hundred years old in our monasteries though in the orthodox east especially in sinai and athos it has existed over a thousand years
it is maintained that it existed in ancient time in russia also but through the calamities which overtook russia the tartars civil war the interruption of relations with the east after the destruction of constantinople this institution fell into oblivion
it was revived among us towards the end of last century by one of the great ascetics as they called him father_paďssy velitchkovsky and his disciples
but to this day it exists in few monasteries only and has sometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in russia
i will try however to give a superficial account of it in a few words it flourished especially in the celebrated kozelski optin monastery
when and how it was introduced into our monastery i cannot say there had already been three such elders and father_zossima was the last of them
the question for our monastery was an important one for it had not been distinguished by anything in particular till then they had neither relics of saints nor wonder working ikons nor glorious traditions nor historical exploits
it had flourished and been glorious all over russia through its elders to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of miles from all parts
but he was almost dying of weakness and disease and they had no one to take his place what was such an elder
when you choose an elder you renounce your own will and yield it to him in complete submission complete self abnegation
this novitiate this terrible school of abnegation is undertaken voluntarily in the hope of self conquest of self mastery in order after a life of obedience to attain perfect freedom that is from self to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life without finding their true selves in themselves
this institution of elders is not founded on theory but was established in the east from the practice of a thousand years
an elder was one who took your soul your will into his soul and his will the obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary obedience which has always existed in our russian monasteries
the obligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted themselves to him and to the indissoluble bond between him and them
the story is told for instance that in the early day of christianity one such novice failing to fulfill some command laid upon him by his elder left his monastery in syria and went to egypt
when the church_of_christ regarding him as a saint was burying him suddenly at the deacon exhortation depart all ye unbaptized the coffin containing the martyr body left its place and was cast forth from the church_of_christ and this took place three time
and only at last they learnt that this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and left his elder and therefore could not be forgiven without the elder absolution in spite of his great deeds
there after great exploits he was found worthy at last to suffer torture and a martyr death for the faith only after this could the funeral take place
a monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit athos which he loved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge and to go first to jerusalem to do homage to the holy places and then to go to the north to siberia
this of course is only an old legend but here is a recent instance there is the place for thee and not here
the monk overwhelmed with sorrow went to the oecumenical patriarch at constantinople and besought him to release him from his obedience
but the patriarch replied that not only was he unable to release him but there was not and could not be on earth a power which could release him except the elder who had himself laid that duty upon him
in this way the elders are endowed in certain cases with unbounded and inexplicable authority that is why in many of our monasteries
the institution was at first resisted almost to persecution meantime the elders immediately began to be highly esteemed among the people
masses of the ignorant people as well as man of distinction flocked for instance to the elders of our monastery to confess their doubts their sins and their sufferings and ask for counsel and admonition
seeing this the opponents of the elders declared that the sacrament of confession was being arbitrarily and frivolously degraded though the continual opening of the heart to the elder by the monk or the layman had nothing of the character of the sacrament
it is true perhaps that this instrument which had stood the test of a thousand years for the moral regeneration of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility may be a two edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility and complete self control but to the most satanic pride that is to bondage and not to freedom
in the end however the institution of elders has been retained and is becoming established in russian monasteries the elder father_zossima was sixty five
he came of a family of landowners had been in the army in early youth and served in the caucasus as an officer
he had no doubt impressed alyosha_karamazov by some peculiar quality of his soul alyosha_karamazov lived in the cell of the elder who was very fond of him and let him wait upon him
it must be noted that alyosha_karamazov was bound by no obligation and could go where he pleased and be absent for whole day
though he wore the monastic dress it was voluntarily not to be different from others no doubt he liked to do so
it was said that so many people had for years past come to confess their sins to father_zossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing that he had acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an unknown face what a new comer wanted and what was the suffering on his conscience
possibly his youthful imagination was deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder he sometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken a word
alyosha_karamazov noticed that many almost all went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension and uneasiness but came out with bright and happy faces
alyosha_karamazov was particularly struck by the fact that father_zossima was not at all stern on the contrary he was always almost gay
the monks used to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful and the greater the sinner the more he loved him
there were no doubt up to the end of his life among the monks some who hated and envied him but they were few in number and they were silent though among them were some of great dignity in the monastery one for instance of the older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence
but the majority were on father_zossima side and very many of them loved him with all their hearts warmly and sincerely
some were almost fanatically devoted to him and declared though not quite aloud that he was a saint that there could be no doubt of it and seeing that his end was near they anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his relics
alyosha_karamazov had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the elder just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin that flew out of the church_of_christ
he saw many who came with sick child or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and to pray over them return shortly after some the next day and falling in tears at the elder feet thank him for healing their sick
whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for alyosha_karamazov for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher and rejoiced in his fame in his glory as though it were his own triumph
his heart throbbed and he beamed as it were all over when the elder came out to the gates of the hermitage into the waiting crowd of pilgrims of the humbler class who had flocked from all parts of russia on purpose to see the elder and obtain his blessing
they fell down before him wept kissed his feet kissed the earth on which he stood and wailed while the women held up their child to him and brought him the sick possessed with devils
of late he had become so weak through attacks of illness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell and the pilgrims waited for him to come out for several day
alyosha_karamazov did not wonder why they loved him so why they fell down before him and wept with emotion merely at seeing his face
he understood that for the humble soul of the russian peasant worn out by grief and toil and still more by the everlasting injustice and everlasting sin his own and the world it was the greatest need and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall down before and worship
the elder spoke to them read a brief prayer over them blessed them and dismissed them oh among us there is sin injustice and temptation but yet somewhere on earth there is some one holy and exalted
he has the truth he knows the truth so it is not dead upon the earth so it will come one day to us too and rule over all the earth according to the promise
he understood it but that the elder father_zossima was this saint and custodian of god truth of that he had no more doubt than the weeping peasants and the sick women who held out their child to the elder
the conviction that after his death the elder would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery was even stronger in alyosha_karamazov than in any one there and of late a kind of deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart
alyosha_karamazov knew that this was just how the people felt and even reasoned he was not at all troubled at this elder standing as a solitary example before him
he carries in his heart the secret of renewal for all that power which will at last establish truth on the earth and all man will be holy and love one another and there will be no more rich nor poor no exalted nor humbled but all will be as the child of god and the true kingdom of church_of_christ will come
the arrival of his two brothers whom he had not known till then seemed to make a great impression on alyosha_karamazov
no matter he is holy that was the dream in alyosha_karamazov heart he more quickly made friends with his half brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov though he arrived later than with his own brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
he was extremely interested in his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but when the latter had been two months in the town though they had met fairly often they were still not intimate
alyosha_karamazov was naturally silent and he seemed to be expecting something ashamed about something while his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov though alyosha_karamazov noticed at first that he looked long and curiously at him seemed soon to have left off thinking of him
alyosha_karamazov noticed it with some embarrassment he ascribed his brother indifference at first to the disparity of their age and education
but he also wondered whether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov might be due to some other cause entirely unknown to him
he kept fancying that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was absorbed in something something inward and important that he was striving towards some goal perhaps very hard to attain and that that was why he had no thought for him
alyosha_karamazov wondered too whether there was not some contempt on the part of the learned atheist for him a foolish novice he knew for certain that his brother was an atheist
he could not take offense at this contempt if it existed yet with an uneasy embarrassment which he did not himself understand he waited for his brother to come nearer to him
from him alyosha_karamazov learnt all the details of the important affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable bond between the two elder brothers
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov enthusiastic references to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov were the more striking in alyosha_karamazov eye since dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was compared with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov almost uneducated and the two brothers were such a contrast in personality and character that it would be difficult to find two man more unlike
it was at this time that the meeting or rather gathering of the members of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder who had such an extraordinary influence on alyosha_karamazov
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov used to speak of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with the deepest respect and with a peculiar earnestness the pretext for this gathering was a false one
it was at this time that the discord between dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and his father_zossima seemed at its acutest stage and their relations had become insufferably strained
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov seems to have been the first to suggest apparently in joke that they should all meet in father_zossima cell and that without appealing to his direct intervention they might more decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence of the elder presence
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov who had never seen the elder naturally supposed that his father_zossima was trying to intimidate him but as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his father_zossima on several recent occasions he accepted the challenge
it must be noted that he was not like ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov staying with his father_zossima but living apart at the other end of the town
a liberal of the forties and fifties a freethinker and atheist he may have been led on by boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion
it happened that pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov who was staying in the district at the time caught eagerly at the idea he was suddenly seized with the desire to see the monastery and the holy man
as his lawsuit with the monastery still dragged on he made it the pretext for seeing the superior in order to attempt to settle it amicably
a visitor coming with such laudable intentions might be received with more attention and consideration than if he came from simple curiosity
influences from within the monastery were brought to bear on the elder who of late had scarcely left his cell and had been forced by illness to deny even his ordinary visitors
in the end he consented to see them and the day was fixed who has made me a judge over them
was all he said smilingly to alyosha_karamazov alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit of all the wrangling quarrelsome party dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was the only one who could regard the interview seriously
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov would come from curiosity perhaps of the coarsest kind while his father_zossima might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery
all the others would come from frivolous motives perhaps insulting to the elder alyosha_karamazov was well aware of that though he said nothing alyosha_karamazov thoroughly understood his father_zossima
the boy i repeat was far from being so simple as every one thought him he awaited the day with a heavy heart
no doubt he was always pondering in his mind how the family discord could be ended but his chief anxiety concerned the elder
he trembled for him for his glory and dreaded any affront to him especially the refined courteous irony of pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov and the supercilious half utterances of the highly educated ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
he only sent word the day before through a friend to his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov that he loved him and expected him to keep his promise
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov wondered for he could not remember what he had promised but he answered by letter that he would do his utmost not to let himself be provoked by vileness but that although he had a deep respect for the elder and for his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he was convinced that the meeting was either a trap for him or an unworthy farce
he even wanted to venture on warning the elder telling him something about them but on second thoughts said nothing
nevertheless i would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking in respect to the sainted man whom you reverence so highly he wrote in conclusion
alyosha_karamazov was not greatly cheered by the letter book ii an unfortunate gathering chapter i they arrive at the monastery it was a warm bright day at the end of august
the interview with the elder had been fixed for half past eleven immediately after late mass our visitors did not take part in the service but arrived just as it was over
first an elegant open carriage drawn by two valuable horses drove up with pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov and a distant relative of his a young man of twenty called pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov fomitch pyotr_fomitch_kalganov
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov with whom he was staying for the time was trying to persuade him to go abroad to the university of zurich or jena
this young man was preparing to enter the university the young man was still undecided he was thoughtful and absent minded he was nice looking strongly built and rather tall
there was a strange fixity in his gaze at time like all very absent minded people he would sometimes stare at a person without seeing him
he was silent and rather awkward but sometimes when he was alone with any one he became talkative and effusive and would laugh at anything or nothing
but his animation vanished as quickly as it appeared he was always well and even elaborately dressed he had already some independent fortune and expectations of much more
in an ancient jolting but roomy hired carriage with a pair of old pinkish gray horses a long way behind pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov carriage came fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov with his son ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
the visitors left their carriage at the hotel outside the precincts and went to the gates of the monastery on foot
except fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov none of the party had ever seen the monastery and pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov had probably not even been to church_of_christ for thirty years
he was a friend of alyosha_karamazov dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was late though he had been informed of the time the evening before he looked about him with curiosity together with assumed ease
but except the church_of_christ and the domestic buildings though these too were ordinary enough he found nothing of interest in the interior of the monastery
the last of the worshippers were coming out of the church_of_christ bareheaded and crossing themselves among the humbler people were a few of higher rank two or three lady and a very old general
our visitors were at once surrounded by beggars but none of them gave them anything except young pyotr_fomitch_kalganov who took a ten copeck piece out of his purse and nervous and embarrassed god knows why hurriedly gave it to an old woman saying divide it equally
none of his companions made any remark upon it so that he had no reason to be embarrassed but perceiving this he was even more overcome
it was strange that their arrival did not seem expected and that they were not received with special honor though one of them had recently made a donation of a thousand roubles while another was a very wealthy and highly cultured landowner upon whom all in the monastery were in a sense dependent as a decision of the lawsuit might at any moment put their fishing rights in his hands
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov looked absent mindedly at the tombstones round the church_of_christ and was on the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a pretty penny for the right of lying in this holy place but refrained
they were all staying at the hotel yet no official personage met them his liberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger
who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place we must find out for time is passing he observed suddenly as though speaking to himself
all at once there came up a bald headed elderly man with ingratiating little eye wearing a full summer overcoat lifting his hat he introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as maximov a landowner of tula
he at once entered into our visitors difficulty father_zossima lives in the hermitage apart four hundred paces from the monastery the other side of the copse
i know it the other side of the copse observed fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov but we dont remember the way it is a long time since we ve been here
this way by this gate and straight across the copse the copse come with me wont you i ll show you
i have to go i am going myself this way this way they came out of the gate and turned towards the copse
maximov a man of sixty ran rather than walked turning sideways to stare at them all with an incredible degree of nervous curiosity
his eye looked starting out of his head you see we have come to the elder upon business of our own observed pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov severely
that personage has granted us an audience so to speak and so though we thank you for showing us the way we cannot ask you to accompany us
i ve been there i ve been already un chevalier parfait and maximov snapped his fingers in the air who is a chevalier asked pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov
but his incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale wan looking monk of medium height wearing a monk cap who overtook them
the elder the splendid elder the elder the honor and glory of the monastery father_zossima such an elder fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov stopped
the monk with an extremely courteous profound bow announced the father_zossima superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him after your visit to the hermitage
at one clock not later and you also he added addressing maximov that i certainly will without fail cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov hugely delighted at the invitation
and believe me we ve all given our word to behave properly here and you pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov will you go too
yes of course what have i come for but to study all the customs here the only obstacle to me is your company
yes dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is non existent as yet it would be a capital thing if he didnt turn up do you suppose i like all this business and in your company too
so we will come to dinner thank the father_zossima superior he said to the monk no it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder answered the monk
if so i ll go straight to the father_zossima superior to the father_zossima superior babbled maximov the father_zossima superior is engaged just now
but as you please the monk hesitated impertinent old man pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov observed aloud while maximov ran back to the monastery
he like von_sohn fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov said suddenly is that all you can think of in what way is he like von_sohn
have you ever seen von_sohn i ve seen his portrait it not the features but something indefinable he a second von_sohn
i can always tell from the physiognomy ah i dare say you are a connoisseur in that but look here fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov you said just now that we had given our word to behave properly
remember it i advise you to control yourself but if you begin to play the fool i dont intend to be associated with you here
a fine smile not without a certain slyness came on to the pale bloodless lips of the monk but he made no reply and was evidently silent from a sense of his own dignity
you see what a man he is he turned to the monk i afraid to go among decent people with him pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov frowned more than ever
oh devil take them all an outer show elaborated through centuries and nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath flashed through pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov mind
and he repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted above and on the sides of the gates
here the hermitage we ve arrived cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov the gates are shut when you go to rome you must do as the romans do
here in this hermitage there are twenty five saints being saved they look at one another and eat cabbages and not one woman goes in at this gate
that what is remarkable and that really is so but i did hear that the elder receives lady he remarked suddenly to the monk
but for lady of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining the portico but outside the precincts you can see the windows and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage when he is well enough
women of the people are here too now lying in the portico there waiting they are always outside the precincts
probably he has promised to come out to her though of late he has been so weak that he has hardly shown himself even to the people
there is a harkov lady madame_hohlakov waiting there now with her sick daughter so then there are loopholes after all to creep out of the hermitage to the lady
but do you know that at athos not only the visits of women are not allowed but no creature of the female sex no hens nor turkey hens nor cows
dont suppose holy father_zossima that i mean any harm fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov i warn you i shall go back and leave you here
they ll turn you out when i gone but i not interfering with you pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov look he cried suddenly stepping within the precincts what a vale of roses they live in
though there were no roses now there were numbers of rare and beautiful autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them and evidently tended by a skillful hand there were flower beds round the church_of_christ and between the tombs and the one storied wooden house where the elder lived was also surrounded with flowers
they say he used to jump up and thrash even lady with a stick observed fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov as he went up the steps
and was it like this in the time of the last elder varsonofy he didnt care for such elegance
the elder varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange but a great deal that told is foolishness he never thrashed any one answered the monk
now gentlemen if you will wait a minute i will announce you fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov for the last time your compact do you hear
behave properly or i will pay you out pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov had time to mutter again i cant think why you are so agitated fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov observed sarcastically
are you uneasy about your sins they say he can tell by one eye what one has come about and what a lot you think of their opinion
you a parisian and so advanced i surprised at you but pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov had no time to reply to this sarcasm
now i know myself i am annoyed i shall lose my temper and begin to quarrel and lower myself and my ideas he reflected
they were asked to come in he walked in somewhat irritated chapter ii the old buffoon they entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came in from his bedroom
there were already in the cell awaiting the elder two monks of the hermitage one the father_zossima librarian and the other father_zossima father_paďssy a very learned man so they said in delicate health though not old
there was also a tall young man who looked about two and twenty standing in the corner throughout the interview he had a broad fresh face and clever observant narrow brown eye and was wearing ordinary dress
he was a divinity student living under the protection of the monastery his expression was one of unquestioning but self respecting reverence
being in a subordinate and dependent position and so not on an equality with the guests he did not greet them with a bow
the two monks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow touching the ground with their fingers then kissed his hand
father_zossima was accompanied by a novice and by alyosha_karamazov blessing them the elder replied with as deep a reverence to them and asked their blessing
the whole ceremony was performed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling not like an everyday rite but pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness
he ought he had reflected upon it the evening before from simple politeness since it was the custom here to have gone up to receive the elder blessing even if he did not kiss his hand
he stood in front of the other visitors but when he saw all this bowing and kissing on the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind
with dignified gravity he made a rather deep conventional bow and moved away to a chair fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov did the same mimicking pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov like an ape
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov bowed with great dignity and courtesy but he too kept his hands at his sides while pyotr_fomitch_kalganov was so confused that he did not bow at all
the elder let fall the hand raised to bless them and bowing to them again asked them all to sit down
father_zossima sat down on a very old fashioned mahogany sofa covered with leather and made his visitors sit down in a row along the opposite wall on four mahogany chairs covered with shabby black leather
the blood rushed to alyosha_karamazov cheeks he was ashamed his forebodings were coming true the monks sat one at the door and the other at the window
the divinity student the novice and alyosha_karamazov remained standing the cell was not very large and had a faded look it contained nothing but the most necessary furniture of coarse and poor quality
there were two pots of flowers in the window and a number of holy pictures in the corner before one huge ancient ikon of the virgin a lamp was burning
near it were two other holy pictures in shining settings and next them carved cherubims china eggs a catholic cross of ivory with a mater dolorosa embracing it and several foreign engravings from the great italian artists of past centuries
next to these costly and artistic engravings were several of the roughest russian prints of saints and martyrs such as are sold for a few farthings at all the fairs
on the other walls were portraits of russian bishops past and present pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov took a cursory glance at all these conventional surroundings and bent an intent look upon the elder
he had a high opinion of his own insight a weakness excusable in him as he was fifty an age at which a clever man of the world of established position can hardly help taking himself rather seriously
at the first moment he did not like father_zossima there was indeed something in the elder face which many people besides pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov might not have liked
he was a short bent little man with very weak legs and though he was only sixty five he looked at least ten years older
his face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles particularly numerous about his eye which were small light colored quick and shining like two bright points
he had a sprinkling of gray hair about his temples his pointed beard was small and scanty and his lips which smiled frequently were as thin as two threads
his nose was not long but sharp like a bird beak to all appearances a malicious soul full of petty pride thought pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov
he felt altogether dissatisfied with his position a cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly and served to begin the conversation
precisely to our time cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov but no sign of my son dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov i apologize for him sacred elder
alyosha_karamazov shuddered all over at sacred elder i am always punctual myself minute for minute remembering that punctuality is the courtesy of kings
but you are not a king anyway pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov muttered losing his self restraint at once yes that true i not a king and would you believe it pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov i was aware of that myself
but there i always say the wrong thing your reverence he cried with sudden pathos you behold before you a buffoon in earnest
and if i sometimes talk nonsense out of place it with an object with the object of amusing people and making myself agreeable
i was seven years ago in a little town where i had business and i made friends with some merchants there
we went to the captain of police because we had to see him about something and to ask him to dine with us
i introduce myself as such it an old habit alas one must be agreeable mustnt one he was a tall fat fair sulky man the most dangerous type in such cases
it their liver i went straight up to him and with the ease of a man of the world you know
mr ispravnik said i be our napravnik what do you mean by napravnik said he i saw at the first half second that it had missed fire
i wanted to make a joke said i for the general diversion as mr napravnik is our well known russian orchestra conductor and what we need for the harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort
he stood there so glum and i explained my comparison very reasonably didnt i excuse me said he i am an ispravnik and i do not allow puns to be made on my calling
he turned and walked away i followed him shouting yes yes you are an ispravnik not a napravnik no he said since you called me a napravnik
i am one and would you believe it it ruined our business and i always like that always like that always injuring myself with my politeness
once many years ago i said to an influential person your wife is a ticklish lady in an honorable sense of the moral qualities so to speak
i thought i be polite so i couldnt help saying yes and he gave me a fine tickling on the spot
but he asked me why have you tickled her only that happened long ago so i not ashamed to tell the story
i always injuring myself like that you re doing it now muttered pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov with disgust father_zossima scrutinized them both in silence
i was aware of that too pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov and let me tell you indeed i foresaw i should as soon as i began to speak
am i would you believe it and do you know i foresaw too that you be the first to remark on it
the minute i see my joke isnt coming off your reverence both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the lower jaw and there is almost a spasm in them
i am an inveterate buffoon and have been from birth up your reverence it as though it were a craze in me
that been so since i was young when i had to make jokes for my living in noblemen families i dare say it a devil within me
but only a little one a more serious one would have chosen another lodging but not your soul pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov you re not a lodging worth having either
but i do believe i believe in god though i have had doubts of late but now i sit and await words of wisdom
did you ever hear most holy father_zossima how diderot went to see the metropolitan platon in the time of the empress catherine
to which the great bishop lifted up his finger and answered the fool hath said in his heart there is no god
i like the philosopher diderot your reverence he went in and said straight out there is no god and he fell down at his feet on the spot
i believe he cried and will be christened and so he was princess dashkov was his godmother and potyomkin his godfather
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov this is unbearable you know you re telling lies and that that stupid anecdote isnt true why are you playing the fool
cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov in a shaking voice i suspected all my life that it wasnt true fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov cried with conviction
but i ll tell you the whole truth gentlemen great elder forgive me the last thing about diderot christening i made up just now
i never thought of it before i made it up to add piquancy i play the fool pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov to make myself agreeable
and as for diderot i heard as far as the fool hath said in his heart twenty time from the gentry about here when i was young
though i really dont know myself sometimes what i do it for i heard your aunt pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov tell the story
they all believe to this day that the infidel diderot came to dispute about god with the metropolitan platon pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov got up forgetting himself in his impatience
for forty or fifty years past from the time of former elders no visitors had entered that cell without feeling of the profoundest veneration
he was furious and conscious of being ridiculous what was taking place in the cell was really incredible almost every one admitted to the cell
of those visitors many had been man of high rank and learning some even freethinkers attracted by curiosity but all without exception had shown the profoundest reverence and delicacy for here there was no question of money but only on the one side love and kindness and on the other penitence and eager desire to decide some spiritual problem or crisis
felt that a great favor was being shown him many remained kneeling during the whole visit so that such buffoonery amazed and bewildered the spectators or at least some of them
the monks with unchanged countenances waited with earnest attention to hear what the elder would say but seemed on the point of standing up like pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov
what seemed to him strangest of all was that his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov on whom alone he had rested his hopes and who alone had such influence on his father_zossima that he could have stopped him sat now quite unmoved with downcast eye apparently waiting with interest to see how it would end as though he had nothing to do with it
alyosha_karamazov stood with hanging head on the verge of tears alyosha_karamazov did not dare to look at mr_rakitin the divinity student whom he knew almost intimately
he alone in the monastery knew mr_rakitin thoughts forgive me began pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov addressing father_zossima for perhaps i seem to be taking part in this shameful foolery
i made a mistake in believing that even a man like fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov would understand what was due on a visit to so honored a personage
i did not suppose i should have to apologize simply for having come with him pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov could say no more and was about to leave the room overwhelmed with confusion
dont distress yourself i beg the elder got on to his feeble legs and taking pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov by both hands made him sit down again
i beg you not to disturb yourself i particularly beg you to be my guest and with a bow he went back and sat down again on his little sofa
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov cried suddenly clutching the arms of his chair in both hands as though ready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable
great elder speak do i annoy you by my vivacity i earnestly beg you too not to disturb yourself and not to be uneasy the elder said impressively
do not trouble make yourself quite at home and above all do not be so ashamed of yourself for that is at the root of it all
quite at home to be my natural self oh that is much too much but i accept it with grateful joy
do you know blessed father_zossima you better not invite me to be my natural self dont risk it i will not go so far as that myself
well the rest is still plunged in the mists of uncertainty though there are people who be pleased to describe me for you
i warn you for your own sake i mean that for you pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov but as for you holy being let me tell you i am brimming over with ecstasy
he got up and throwing up his hands declaimed blessed be the womb that bare thee and the paps that gave thee suck the paps especially
when you said just now dont be so ashamed of yourself for that is at the root of it all you pierced right through me by that remark and read me to the core
indeed i always feel when i meet people that i am lower than all and that they all take me for a buffoon
so i say let me really play the buffoon i am not afraid of your opinion for you are every one of you worse than i am
that is why i am a buffoon it is from shame great elder from shame it simply over sensitiveness that makes me rowdy
if i had only been sure that every one would accept me as the kindest and wisest of man oh lord what a good man i should have been then
teacher he fell suddenly on his knees what must i do to gain eternal life it was difficult even now to decide whether he was joking or really moved
father_zossima lifting his eye looked at him and said with a smile you have known for a long time what you must do
you have sense enough dont give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech dont give way to sensual lust and above all to the love of money
and close your taverns if you cant close all at least two or three and above all dont lie you mean about diderot
the man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to such a pass that he cannot distinguish the truth within him or around him and so loses all respect for himself and for others
and having no respect he ceases to love and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he gives way to passions and coarse pleasures and sinks to bestiality in his vices all from continual lying to other man and to himself
no not about diderot above all dont lie to yourself the man who lies to himself can be more easily offended than any one
a man may know that nobody has insulted him but that he has invented the insult for himself has lied and exaggerated to make it picturesque has caught at a word and made a mountain out of a molehill he knows that himself yet he will be the first to take offense and will revel in his resentment till he feels great pleasure in it and so pass to genuine vindictiveness
you know it is sometimes very pleasant to take offense isnt it but get up sit down i beg you all this too is deceitful posturing
blessed man give me your hand to kiss fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov skipped up and imprinted a rapid kiss on the elder thin hand
yes i have been all my life taking offense to please myself taking offense on esthetic grounds for it is not so much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted that you had forgotten great elder it is distinguished
it is it is pleasant to take offense you said that so well as i never heard it before i shall make a note of that
but i have been lying lying positively my whole life long every day and hour of it of a truth i am a lie and the father_zossima of lies
though i believe i am not the father_zossima of lies i am getting mixed in my texts say the son of lies and that will be enough
only my angel i may sometimes talk about diderot diderot will do no harm though sometimes a word will do harm
great elder by the way i was forgetting though i had been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose to ask and to find out something
here is my question is it true great father_zossima that the story is told somewhere in the lives of the saints of a holy saint martyred for his faith who when his head was cut off at last stood up picked up his head and courteously kissing it walked a long way carrying it in his hands
only do tell pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov not to interrupt me is that true or not honored father_zossima no it is untrue said the elder
there is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints what saint do you say the story is told of
asked the father_zossima librarian i do not know what saint i do not know and cant tell i was deceived
i was told the story i had heard it and do you know who told it pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov here who was so angry just now about diderot
he it was who told the story i have never told it you i never speak to you at all
it is true you did not tell me but you told it when i was present it was three years ago
you knew nothing of it but i went home with my faith shaken and i have been getting more and more shaken ever since
i mentioned it because by that ridiculous story you shook my faith pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov yes pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov you were the cause of a great fall
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov got excited and pathetic though it was perfectly clear to every one by now that he was playing a part again
that was not a diderot yet pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov was stung by his words what nonsense and it is all nonsense he muttered
i may really have told it some time or other but not to you i was told it myself
he told me it was read at our mass from the lives of the saints he was a very learned man who had made a special study of russian statistics and had lived a long time in russia
i heard it in paris from a frenchman i have not read the lives of the saints myself and i am not going to read them
all sort of things are said at dinner we were dining then yes you were dining then and so i lost my faith
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov was on the point of shouting but he suddenly checked himself and said with contempt you defile everything you touch
said fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov mimicking him what do i care for your faith the elder suddenly rose from his seat
excuse me gentlemen for leaving you a few minutes he said addressing all his guests i have visitors awaiting me who arrived before you
but dont you tell lies all the same he added turning to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov with a good humored face he went out of the cell
alyosha_karamazov was breathless he was glad to get away but he was glad too that the elder was good humored and not offended
alyosha_karamazov and the novice flew to escort him down the steps father_zossima was going towards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there
but fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell blessed man he cried with feeling
allow me to kiss your hand once more yes with you i could still talk i could still get on do you think i always lie and play the fool like this
believe me i have been acting like this all the time on purpose to try you i have been testing you all the time to see whether i could get on with you
is there room for my humility beside your pride i am ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you
but now i ll be quiet i will keep quiet all the time i ll sit in a chair and hold my tongue
now it is for you to speak pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov you are the principal person left now for ten minutes chapter iii
peasant women who have faith near the wooden portico below built on to the outer wall of the precinct there was a crowd of about twenty peasant women
two lady madame_hohlakov and her daughter had also come out into the portico to wait for the elder but in a separate part of it set aside for women of rank
they had been told that the elder was at last coming out and they had gathered together in anticipation madame_hohlakov was a wealthy lady still young and attractive and always dressed with taste
she was rather pale and had lively black eye she was not more than thirty three and had been five years a widow
the poor child had not been able to walk for the last six months and was wheeled about in a long reclining chair
her daughter a girl of fourteen was partially paralyzed she had a charming little face rather thin from illness but full of gayety
her mother had been intending to take her abroad ever since the spring but they had been detained all the summer by business connected with their estate
they had been staying a week in our town where they had come more for purposes of business than devotion but had visited father_zossima once already three day before
though they knew that the elder scarcely saw any one they had now suddenly turned up again and urgently entreated the happiness of looking once again on the great healer
the mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her daughter invalid carriage and two paces from her stood an old monk not one of our monastery but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far north
there was a gleam of mischief in her big dark eye with their long lashes he too sought the elder blessing
but father_zossima on entering the portico went first straight to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up into the portico
father_zossima stood on the top step put on his stole and began blessing the women who thronged about him one crazy woman was led up to him
as soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth
laying the stole on her forehead he read a short prayer over her and she was at once soothed and quieted
i do not know how it may be now but in my childhood i often happened to see and hear these possessed women in the villages and monasteries
they used to be brought to mass they would squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the church_of_christ
but when the sacrament was carried in and they were led up to it at once the possession ceased and the sick women were always soothed for a time
i was greatly impressed and amazed at this as a child but then i heard from country neighbors and from my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work and that it could always be cured by suitable severity various anecdotes were told to confirm this
but later on i learnt with astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretense about it that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject specially prevalent among us in russia and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women
it is a disease i was told arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth and from the hopeless misery from beatings and so on which some women were not able to endure like others
the strange and instant healing of the frantic and struggling woman as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament which had been explained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the clericals arose probably in the most natural manner
both the women who supported her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond question that the evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and made to bow down before it
and so with a nervous and psychically deranged woman a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always took place and was bound to take place at the moment of bowing down to the sacrament aroused by the expectation of the miracle of healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass and it did come to pass though only for a moment
many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by the effect of the moment some strove to kiss the hem of his garment others cried out in sing song voices
it was exactly the same now as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole he blessed them all and talked with some of them
the possessed woman he knew already she came from a village only six versts from the monastery and had been brought to him before
he pointed to a woman by no means old but very thin and wasted with a face not merely sunburnt but almost blackened by exposure
but here is one from afar she was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare at the elder there was something almost frenzied in her eye
from afar off father_zossima from afar off from two hundred miles from here from afar off father_zossima from afar off
the woman began in a sing song voice as though she were chanting a dirge swaying her head from side to side with her cheek resting in her hand
but there is a grief that breaks out and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds vent in wailing
there is silent and long suffering sorrow to be met with among the peasantry it withdraws into itself and is still this is particularly common with women
but it is no lighter a grief than the silent lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart still more such grief does not desire consolation
it feeds on the sense of its hopelessness lamentations spring only from the constant craving to reopen the wound you are of the tradesman class said father_zossima looking curiously at her
townfolk we are father_zossima townfolk yet we are peasants though we live in the town i have come to see you father_zossima
we heard of you father_zossima we heard of you i have buried my little son and i have come on a pilgrimage
i have been in three monasteries but they told me go nastasya go to them that is to you i have come i was yesterday at the service and to day i have come to you
what are you weeping for it my little son i grieving for father_zossima he was three years old three years all but three months
for my little boy father_zossima i in anguish for my little boy he was the last one left we had four my nikita and i and now we ve no child
our dear ones have all gone i buried the first three without grieving overmuch and now i have buried the last i cant forget him
he seems always standing before me he never leaves me he has withered my heart i look at his little clothes his little shirt his little boots and i wail
i lay out all that is left of him all his little things i look at them and wail i say to nikita my husband let me go on a pilgrimage master
he is a driver we re not poor people father_zossima not poor he drives our own horse it all our own the horse and the carriage
and what good is it all to us now my nikita has begun drinking while i am away he sure to
it used to be so before as soon as i turn my back he gives way to it but now i dont think about him
it three months since i left home i ve forgotten him i ve forgotten everything i dont want to remember and what would our life be now together
i ve done with him i ve done i ve done with them all i dont care to look upon my house and my goods
once in olden time a holy saint saw in the temple a mother like you weeping for her little one her only one whom god had taken
i dont care to see anything at all listen mother said the elder knowest thou not said the saint to her how bold these little ones are before the throne of god
thou didst give us life lord they say and scarcely had we looked upon it when thou didst take it back again
verily there are none bolder than they in the kingdom of heaven and so boldly they ask and ask again that god gives them at once the rank of angels
therefore said the saint thou too mother rejoice and weep not for thy little son is with the lord in the fellowship of the angels
that what the saint said to the weeping mother of old he was a great saint and he could not have spoken falsely
therefore you too mother know that your little one is surely before the throne of god is rejoicing and happy and praying to god for you and therefore weep not but rejoice
the woman listened to him looking down with her cheek in her hand she sighed deeply my nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you
foolish one he said why weep our son is no doubt singing with the angels before god he says that to me but he weeps himself
i see that he cries like me i know nikita said i where could he be if not with the lord god
and if only i could look upon him one little time if only i could peep at him one little time without going up to him without speaking if i could be hidden in a corner and only see him for one little minute hear him playing in the yard calling in his little voice mammy where are you
if only i could hear him pattering with his little feet about the room just once only once for so often so often i remember how he used to run to me and shout and laugh if only i could hear his little feet i should know him
only here with us now he is not as he used to sit beside us before but he gone father_zossima he gone and i shall never hear him again
she drew out of her bosom her boy little embroidered sash and as soon as she looked at it she began shaking with sobs hiding her eye with her fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden stream
it is rachel of old said the elder weeping for her child and will not be comforted because they are not
here his little sash but him i shall never see or hear now such is the lot set on earth for you mothers
only every time that you weep be sure to remember that your little son is one of the angels of god that he looks down from there at you and sees you and rejoices at your tears and points at them to the lord god and a long while yet will you keep that great mother grief
but it will turn in the end into quiet joy and your bitter tears will be only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart and delivers it from sin
be not comforted consolation is not what you need weep and be not consoled but weep and i shall pray for the peace of your child soul
what was his name alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov father_zossima a sweet name after alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov the man of god yes father_zossima what a saint he was
i will remember him mother and your grief in my prayers and i will pray for your husband health it is a sin for you to leave him
your little one will see from heaven that you have forsaken his father_zossima and will weep over you why do you trouble his happiness
he is living for the soul lives for ever and though he is not in the house he is near you unseen
how can he go into the house when you say that the house is hateful to you to whom is he to go if he find you not together his father_zossima and mother
he comes to you in dreams now and you grieve but then he will send you gentle dreams go to your husband mother go this very day
my nikita my nikita you are waiting for me the woman began in a sing song voice but the elder had already turned away to a very old woman dressed like a dweller in the town not like a pilgrim
i will go father_zossima at your word i will go you ve gone straight to my heart her eye showed that she had come with an object and in order to say something
she said she was the widow of a non commissioned officer and lived close by in the town her son vasenka was in the commissariat service and had gone to irkutsk in siberia
he had written twice from there but now a year had passed since he had written she did inquire about him but she did not know the proper place to inquire
only the other day stepanida ilyinishna she a rich merchant wife said to me you go prohorovna and put your son name down for prayer in the church_of_christ and pray for the peace of his soul as though he were dead
his soul will be troubled she said and he will write you a letter and stepanida ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing which had been many time tried
only i am in doubt oh you light of ours is it true or false and would it be right dont think of it
it shameful to ask the question how is it possible to pray for the peace of a living soul and his own mother too
better pray to the queen of heaven our swift defense and help for his good health and that she may forgive you for your error
it a great sin akin to sorcery only for your ignorance it is forgiven you and another thing i will tell you prohorovna
either he will soon come back to you your son or he will be sure to send a letter go and henceforward be in peace
your son is alive i tell you dear father_zossima god reward you our benefactor who prays for all of us and for our sins
but the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eye fixed upon him an exhausted consumptive looking though young peasant woman was gazing at him in silence
her eye besought him but she seemed afraid to approach what is it my child absolve my soul father_zossima she articulated softly and slowly sank on her knees and bowed down at his feet
i have sinned father_zossima i am afraid of my sin the elder sat down on the lower step the woman crept closer to him still on her knees
i am a widow these three years she began in a half whisper with a sort of shudder i had a hard life with my husband
he lay ill i thought looking at him if he were to get well if he were to get up again what then
he was an old man he used to beat me cruelly and then the thought came to me stay said the elder and he put his ear close to her lips
the woman went on in a low whisper so that it was almost impossible to catch anything she had soon done
three years ago asked the elder three years at first i didnt think about it but now i ve begun to be ill and the thought never leaves me
have you come from far over three hundred miles away have you told it in confession i have confessed it
twice i have confessed it have you been admitted to communion yes i am afraid i am afraid to die
there is no sin and there can be no sin on all the earth which the lord will not forgive to the truly repentant
fear nothing and never be afraid and dont fret if only your penitence fail not god will forgive all man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust the infinite love of god
can there be a sin which could exceed the love of god think only of repentance continual repentance but dismiss fear altogether
it has been said of old that over one repentant sinner there is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous man
believe that god loves you as you cannot conceive that he loves you with your sin in your sin go and fear not
be not bitter against man be not angry if you are wronged forgive the dead man in your heart what wrong he did you
be reconciled with him in truth if you are penitent you love and if you love you are of god all things are atoned for all things are saved by love
if i a sinner even as you are am tender with you and have pity on you how much more will god
love is such a priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it and expiate not only your own sins but the sins of others
he signed her three time with the cross took from his own neck a little ikon and put it upon her
she bowed down to the earth without speaking he got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with a tiny baby in her arms
from vyshegorye dear father_zossima five miles you have dragged yourself with the baby what do you want i ve come to look at you
i have been to you before or have you forgotten you ve no great memory if you ve forgotten me they told us you were ill
thinks i i ll go and see him for myself now i see you and you re not ill you ll live another twenty years
god bless you there are plenty to pray for you how should you be ill i thank you for all daughter
by the way i have a thing to ask not a great one here are sixty copecks give them dear father_zossima to some one poorer than me
i thought as i came along better give through him he ll know whom to give to thanks my dear thanks
you are a good woman i love you i will do so certainly is that your little girl my little girl father_zossima lizaveta
may the lord bless you both you and your babe lizaveta you have gladdened my heart mother farewell dear child farewell dear ones
faith a visitor looking on the scene of his conversation with the peasants and his blessing them shed silent tears and wiped them away with her handkerchief
he blessed them all and bowed low to them chapter iv a lady of little she was a sentimental society lady of genuinely good disposition in many respects
when the elder went up to her at last she met him enthusiastically ah what i have been feeling looking on at this touching scene
she could not go on for emotion oh i understand the people love for you i love the people myself
i want to love them and who could help loving them our splendid russian people so simple in their greatness how is your daughter health
you wanted to talk to me again oh i have been urgently begging for it i have prayed for it
i was ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three day at your windows until you let me in
you have healed my lise healed her completely merely by praying over her last thursday and laying your hands upon her
we have come great healer to express our ardent gratitude we have hastened here to kiss those hands to pour out our feeling and our homage
what do you mean by healed but she is still lying down in her chair but her night fevers have entirely ceased ever since thursday said the lady with nervous haste
and that not all her legs are stronger this morning she got up well she had slept all night look at her rosy cheeks her bright eye
this morning she insisted on my letting her stand up and she stood up for a whole minute without any support
she used to be always crying but now she laughs and is gay and happy she wagers that in a fortnight she ll be dancing a quadrille
i ve called in doctor herzenstube he shrugged his shoulders and said i am amazed i can make nothing of it and would you have us not come here to disturb you not fly here to thank you
she rose in her chair as far as she could and looking at the elder clasped her hands before him but could not restrain herself and broke into laughter
it at him she said pointing to alyosha_karamazov with childish vexation at herself for not being able to repress her mirth
if any one had looked at alyosha_karamazov standing a step behind the elder he would have caught a quick flush crimsoning his cheeks in an instant
lise thank him thank him lise pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious his eye shone and he looked down
she has a message for you alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how are you the mother went on holding out her exquisitely gloved hand to alyosha_karamazov
the elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at alyosha_karamazov the latter went nearer to lise and smiling in a strangely awkward way held out his hand to her too
lise assumed an important air katerina_ivanovna has sent you this through me she handed him a little note
she particularly begs you to go and see her as soon as possible that you will not fail her but will be sure to come
she asks me to go and see her me what for alyosha_karamazov muttered in great astonishment his face at once looked anxious
oh it all to do with dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and what has happened lately the mother explained hurriedly katerina_ivanovna has made up her mind but she must see you about it
why of course i cant say but she wants to see you at once and you will go to her of course
it is a christian duty i have only seen her once alyosha_karamazov protested with the same perplexity oh she is such a lofty incomparable creature
if only for her suffering think what she has gone through what she is enduring now think what awaits her it all terrible terrible
very well i will come alyosha_karamazov decided after rapidly scanning the brief enigmatic note which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he would come without any sort of explanation
oh how sweet and generous that would be of you cried lise with sudden animation i told mamma you be sure not to go
i said you were saving your soul how splendid you are i ve always thought you were splendid how glad i am to tell you so
lise said her mother impressively though she smiled after she had said it you have quite forgotten us alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov she said you never come to see us
yet lise has told me twice that she is never happy except with you alyosha_karamazov raised his downcast eye and again flushed and again smiled without knowing why
but the elder was no longer watching him he had begun talking to a monk who as mentioned before had been awaiting his entrance by lise chair
he was evidently a monk of the humblest that is of the peasant class of a narrow outlook but a true believer and in his own way a stubborn one
he announced that he had come from the far north from obdorsk from saint sylvester and was a member of a poor monastery consisting of only ten monks
the elder gave him his blessing and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked how can you presume to do such deeds
the monk asked suddenly pointing solemnly and significantly at lise he was referring to her healing it too early of course to speak of that
relief is not complete cure and may proceed from different causes but if there has been any healing it is by no power
but god will it all from god visit me father_zossima he added to the monk it not often i can see visitors
i am ill and i know that my day are numbered oh no no god will not take you from us
you will live a long long time yet cried the lady and in what way are you ill you look so well so gay and happy
i am extraordinarily better to day but i know that it only for a moment i understand my disease now thoroughly if i seem so happy to you you could never say anything that would please me so much
for man are made for happiness and any one who is completely happy has a right to say to himself i am doing god will on earth
all the righteous all the saints all the holy martyrs were happy oh how you speak what bold and lofty words cried the lady
you seem to pierce with your words and yet happiness happiness where is it who can say of himself that he is happy
oh since you have been so good as to let us see you once more to day let me tell you what i could not utter last time what i dared not say all i am suffering and have been for so long
i am suffering forgive me i am suffering and in a rush of fervent feeling she clasped her hands before him
from what specially i suffer from lack of faith lack of faith in god oh no no i dare not even think of that
you are a healer you are deeply versed in the human soul and of course i dare not expect you to believe me entirely but i assure you on my word of honor that i am not speaking lightly now
but the future life it is such an enigma and no one no one can solve it listen the thought of the life beyond the grave distracts me to anguish to terror
and i dont know to whom to appeal and have not dared to all my life and now i am so bold as to ask you
oh god what will you think of me now she clasped her hands dont distress yourself about my opinion of you said the elder
i quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering oh how thankful i am to you you see i shut my eye and ask myself if every one has faith where did it come from
and then they do say that it all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of nature and that none of it real
and i say to myself what if i ve been believing all my life and when i come to die there nothing but the burdocks growing on my grave as i read in some author
it awful how how can i get back my faith but i only believed when i was a little child mechanically without thinking of anything
how how is one to prove it i have come now to lay my soul before you and to ask you about it
if i let this chance slip no one all my life will answer me how can i prove it how can i convince myself
i stand and look about me and see that scarcely any one else cares no one troubles his head about it and i the only one who cant stand it
oh how unhappy i am it deadly deadly no doubt but there no proving it though you can be convinced of it
in as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of the reality of god and of the immortality of your soul
if you attain to perfect self forgetfulness in the love of your neighbor then you will believe without doubt and no doubt can possibly enter your soul
how by the experience of active love strive to love your neighbor actively and indefatigably this has been tried
you see i so love humanity that would you believe it i often dream of forsaking all that i have leaving lise and becoming a sister of mercy
i close my eye and think and dream and at that moment i feel full of strength to overcome all obstacles
this is certain in active love there another question and such a question no wounds no festering sores could at that moment frighten me
i would bind them up and wash them with my own hands i would nurse the afflicted i would be ready to kiss such wounds
it is much and well that your mind is full of such dreams and not others sometime unawares you may do a good deed in reality
yes but could i endure such a life for long the lady went on fervently almost frantically that the chief question that my most agonizing question
and if the patient whose wounds you are washing did not meet you with gratitude but worried you with his whims without valuing or remarking your charitable services began abusing you and rudely commanding you and complaining to the superior authorities of you which often happens when people are in great suffering what then
i shut my eye and ask myself would you persevere long on that path would you persevere in your love or not
and do you know i came with horror to the conclusion that if anything could dissipate my love to humanity it would be ingratitude
in short i am a hired servant i expect my payment at once that is praise and the repayment of love with love
otherwise i am incapable of loving any one she was in a very paroxysm of self castigation and concluding she looked with defiant resolution at the elder
it just the same story as a doctor once told me observed the elder he was a man getting on in years and undoubtedly clever
he spoke as frankly as you though in jest in bitter jest i love humanity he said but i wonder at myself
in my dreams he said i have often come to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity and perhaps i might actually have faced crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary and yet i am incapable of living in the same room with any one for two day together as i know by experience
the more i love humanity in general the less i love man in particular as soon as any one is near me his personality disturbs my self complacency and restricts my freedom
in twenty four hours i begin to hate the best of man one because he too long over his dinner another because he has a cold and keeps on blowing his nose
but it has always happened that the more i detest man individually the more ardent becomes my love for humanity
i become hostile to people the moment they come close to me but what to be done what can one do in such a case
must one despair no it is enough that you are distressed at it do what you can and it will be reckoned unto you
if you have been talking to me so sincerely simply to gain approbation for your frankness as you did from me just now then of course you will not attain to anything in the achievement of real love it will all get no further than dreams and your whole life will slip away like a phantom
in that case you will naturally cease to think of the future life too and will of yourself grow calmer after a fashion in the end
only now as you speak i understand that i was really only seeking your approbation for my sincerity when i told you i could not endure ingratitude
much is done already in you since you can so deeply and sincerely know yourself you have crushed me you have revealed me to myself
you have seen through me and explained me to myself are you speaking the truth well now after such a confession i believe that you are sincere and good at heart
if you do not attain happiness always remember that you are on the right road and try not to leave it
above all avoid falsehood every kind of falsehood especially falseness to yourself watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour every minute
avoid being scornful both to others and to yourself what seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing it in yourself
avoid fear too though fear is only the consequence of every sort of falsehood never be frightened at your own faint heartedness in attaining love
i am sorry i can say nothing more consoling to you for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams
dont be frightened overmuch even at your evil actions love in dreams is greedy for immediate action rapidly performed and in the sight of all
man will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon over with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage
but i predict that just when you see with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther from your goal instead of nearer to it at that very moment i predict that you will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power of the lord who has been all the time loving and mysteriously guiding you
but active love is labor and fortitude and for some people too perhaps a complete science forgive me for not being able to stay longer with you
they are waiting for me good by the lady was weeping lise lise bless her bless her she cried starting up suddenly
she does not deserve to be loved i have seen her naughtiness all along the elder said jestingly why have you been laughing at alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov
she had noticed before that alyosha_karamazov was shy and tried not to look at her and she found this extremely amusing
alyosha_karamazov unable to endure her persistent stare was irresistibly and suddenly drawn to glance at her and at once she smiled triumphantly in his face
lise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him all the time she waited intently to catch his eye alyosha_karamazov was even more disconcerted and vexed
after a few minutes drawn by the same irresistible force he turned again to see whether he was being looked at or not and found lise almost hanging out of her chair to peep sideways at him eagerly waiting for him to look
catching his eye she laughed so that the elder could not help saying why do you make fun of him like that naughty girl
at last he turned away from her altogether and hid behind the elder back lise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed
her eye flashed and her face became quite serious she began speaking quickly and nervously in a warm and resentful voice why has he forgotten everything then
he used to carry me about when i was little we used to play together he used to come to teach me to read do you know
two years ago when he went away he said that he would never forget me that we were friends for ever for ever for ever
and now he afraid of me all at once am i going to eat him why doesnt he want to come near me
why doesnt he talk why wont he come and see us it not that you wont let him we know that he goes everywhere
it not good manners for me to invite him he ought to have thought of it first if he hasnt forgotten me
no now he saving his soul why have you put that long gown on him if he runs he ll fall
and suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into irresistible prolonged nervous inaudible laughter the elder listened to her with a smile and blessed her tenderly
as she kissed his hand she suddenly pressed it to her eye and began crying dont be angry with me
i silly and good for nothing and perhaps alyosha_karamazov right quite right in not wanting to come and see such a ridiculous girl
i will certainly send him said the elder chapter so be it so be it the elder absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty five minutes
but he seemed almost to be forgotten and when the elder entered the cell again he found his guests engaged in eager conversation
it was more than half past twelve but dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov on whose account they had all met there had still not appeared ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and the two monks took the leading share in it
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov too was trying to take a part and apparently very eagerly in the conversation but he was unsuccessful in this also
he was evidently in the background and his remarks were treated with neglect which increased his irritability he had had intellectual encounters with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov before and he could not endure a certain carelessness ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov showed him
hitherto at least i have stood in the front ranks of all that is progressive in europe and here the new generation positively ignores us he thought
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who had given his word to sit still and be quiet had actually been quiet for some time but he watched his neighbor pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov with an ironical little smile obviously enjoying his discomfiture
he had been waiting for some time to pay off old scores and now he could not let the opportunity slip
bending over his shoulder he began teasing him again in a whisper why didnt you go away just now after the courteously kissing
why did you consent to remain in such unseemly company it was because you felt insulted and aggrieved and you remained to vindicate yourself by showing off your intelligence
now you wont go till you ve displayed your intellect to them you again on the contrary i just going you ll be the last the last of all to go
the discussion died down for a moment but the elder seating himself in his former place looked at them all as though cordially inviting them to go on
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov delivered him another thrust almost at the moment of father_zossima return alyosha_karamazov who knew every expression of his face saw that he was fearfully exhausted and making a great effort
of late he had been liable to fainting fits from exhaustion his face had the pallor that was common before such attacks and his lips were white
but he evidently did not want to break up the party he seemed to have some special object of his own in keeping them
what object alyosha_karamazov watched him intently we are discussing this gentleman most interesting article said father_zossima iosif the librarian addressing the elder and indicating ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
it is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiastical authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court and the scope of its jurisdiction
i sorry i have not read your article but i ve heard of it said the elder looking keenly and intently at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
he brings forward much that is new but i think the argument cuts both ways he takes up a most interesting position continued the father_zossima librarian
as far as church_of_christ jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently quite opposed to the separation of church_of_christ from state
the latter at last answered him not condescendingly as alyosha_karamazov had feared but with modesty and reserve with evident goodwill and apparently without the slightest arričre pensée
i start from the position that this confusion of elements that is of the essential principles of church_of_christ and state will of course go on for ever in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle and that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent or even normal results for there is falsity at the very foundation of it
compromise between the church_of_christ and state in such questions as for instance jurisdiction is to my thinking impossible in any real sense
that interesting but in what sense father_zossima asked ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov my clerical opponent maintains that the church_of_christ holds a precise and defined position in the state
i maintain on the contrary that the church_of_christ ought to include the whole state and not simply to occupy a corner in it and if this is for some reason impossible at present then it ought in reality to be set up as the direct and chief aim of the future development of christian society
perfectly true father_zossima father_paďssy the silent and learned monk assented with fervor and decision the purest ultramontanism cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov impatiently crossing and recrossing his legs
observe the answer he makes to the following fundamental and essential propositions of his opponent who is you must note an ecclesiastic
first that no social organization can or ought to arrogate to itself power to dispose of the civic and political rights of its members
secondly that criminal and civil jurisdiction ought not to belong to the church_of_christ and is inconsistent with its nature both as a divine institution and as an organization of man for religious objects and finally in the third place the church_of_christ is a kingdom not of this world
oh well we have no mountains cried father_zossima iosif and turning to the elder he continued a most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic
i have read the book which you have answered he added addressing ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and was astounded at the words the church_of_christ is a kingdom not of this world
father_zossima father_paďssy could not refrain from breaking in again if it is not of this world then it cannot exist on earth at all
in the gospel the words not of this world are not used in that sense to play with such words is indefensible
the kingdom of heaven of course is not of this world but in heaven but it is only entered through the church_of_christ which has been founded and established upon earth
our lord jesus church_of_christ came to set up the church_of_christ upon earth and so a frivolous play upon words in such a connection is unpardonable and improper
the church_of_christ is in truth a kingdom and ordained to rule and in the end must undoubtedly become the kingdom ruling over all the earth
after listening attentively and respectfully ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went on addressing the elder with perfect composure and as before with ready cordiality the whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the first three centuries christianity only existed on earth in the church_of_christ and was nothing but the church_of_christ
when the pagan roman empire desired to become christian it inevitably happened that by becoming christian it included the church_of_christ but remained a pagan state in very many of its departments
for that we have the divine promise he ceased speaking suddenly as though checking himself in reality this was bound to happen
but rome as a state retained too much of the pagan civilization and culture as for example in the very objects and fundamental principles of the state
the christian church_of_christ entering into the state could of course surrender no part of its fundamental principles the rock on which it stands and could pursue no other aims than those which have been ordained and revealed by god himself and among them that of drawing the whole world and therefore the ancient pagan state itself into the church_of_christ
in that way that is with a view to the future it is not the church_of_christ that should seek a definite position in the state like every social organization or as an organization of man for religious purposes as my opponent calls the church_of_christ but on the contrary every earthly state should be in the end completely transformed into the church_of_christ and should become nothing else but a church_of_christ rejecting every purpose incongruous with the aims of the church_of_christ
all this will not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory as a great state nor from the glory of its rulers but only turns it from a false still pagan and mistaken path to the true and rightful path which alone leads to the eternal goal
this is why the author of the book on the foundations of church_of_christ jurisdiction would have judged correctly if in seeking and laying down those foundations he had looked upon them as a temporary compromise inevitable in our sinful and imperfect day
but as soon as the author ventures to declare that the foundations which he predicates now part of which father_zossima iosif just enumerated are the permanent essential and eternal foundations he is going directly against the church_of_christ and its sacred and eternal vocation
that is in brief father_zossima father_paďssy began again laying stress on each word according to certain theories only too clearly formulated in the nineteenth century the church_of_christ ought to be transformed into the state as though this would be an advance from a lower to a higher form so as to disappear into it making way for science for the spirit of the age and civilization
and if the church_of_christ resists and is unwilling some corner will be set apart for her in the state and even that under control and this will be so everywhere in all modern european country
but russian hopes and conceptions demand not that the church_of_christ should pass as from a lower into a higher type into the state but on the contrary that the state should end by being worthy to become only the church_of_christ and nothing else
that is the gist of my article so be it so be it well i confess you ve reassured me somewhat pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov said smiling again crossing his legs
so far as i understand then the realization of such an ideal is infinitely remote at the second coming of church_of_christ
it a beautiful utopian dream of the abolition of war diplomacy bank and so on something after the fashion of socialism indeed
but i imagined that it was all meant seriously and that the church_of_christ might be now going to try criminals and sentence them to beating prison and even death
but if there were none but the ecclesiastical court the church_of_christ would not even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death
crime and the way of regarding it would inevitably change not all at once of course but fairly soon ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov replied calmly without flinching
if everything became the church_of_christ the church_of_christ would exclude all the criminal and disobedient and would not cut off their heads ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went on
that as you please are you serious pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov glanced keenly at him i ask you what would become of the excluded
he would be cut off then not only from man as now but from church_of_christ by his crime he would have transgressed not only against man but against the church_of_christ
this is so even now of course strictly speaking but it is not clearly enunciated and very very often the criminal of to day compromises with his conscience i steal he says but i dont go against the church_of_christ
that what the criminal of to day is continually saying to himself but when the church_of_christ takes the place of the state it will be difficult for him in opposition to the church_of_christ all over the world to say all man are mistaken all in error all mankind are the false church_of_christ
i not an enemy of church_of_christ i a thief and murderer am the only true christian church_of_christ it will be very difficult to say this to himself it requires a rare combination of unusual circumstances
now on the other side take the church_of_christ own view of crime is it not bound to renounce the present almost pagan attitude and to change from a mechanical cutting off of its tainted member for the preservation of society as at present into completely and honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man of his reformation and salvation
what do you mean i fail to understand again pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov interrupted some sort of dream again something shapeless and even incomprehensible
yes but you know in reality it is so now said the elder suddenly and all turned to him at once
if it were not for the church_of_christ there would be nothing to restrain the criminal from evil doing no real chastisement for it afterwards none that is but the mechanical punishment spoken of just now which in the majority of cases only embitters the heart and not the real punishment the only effectual one the only deterrent and softening one which lies in the recognition of sin by conscience
what is excommunication what sort of exclusion i suspect you are simply amusing yourself ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how is that may one inquire
why began the elder all these sentences to exile with hard labor and formerly with flogging also reform no one and what more deter hardly a single criminal and the number of crimes does not diminish but is continually on the increase
consequently the security of society is not preserved for although the obnoxious member is mechanically cut off and sent far away out of sight another criminal always comes to take his place at once and often two of them
if anything does preserve society even in our time and does regenerate and transform the criminal it is only the law of church_of_christ speaking in his conscience
it is only by recognizing his wrong doing as a son of a christian society that is of the church_of_christ that he recognizes his sin against society that is against the church_of_christ
so that it is only against the church_of_christ and not against the state that the criminal of to day can recognize that he has sinned
if society as a church_of_christ had jurisdiction then it would know when to bring back from exclusion and to reunite to itself
now the church_of_christ having no real jurisdiction but only the power of moral condemnation withdraws of her own accord from punishing the criminal actively
asked pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov with lively curiosity you must admit that she does not excommunicate him but simply persists in motherly exhortation of him
she admits him to church_of_christ services to the holy sacrament gives him alms and treats him more as a captive than as a convict
and what would become of the criminal lord if even the christian society that is the church_of_christ were to reject him even as the civil law rejects him and cuts him off
what would become of him if the church_of_christ punished him with her excommunication as the direct consequence of the secular law
what is more the church_of_christ even tries to preserve all christian communion with the criminal there could be no more terrible despair at least for a russian criminal for russian criminals still have faith
though who knows perhaps then a fearful thing would happen perhaps the despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then what would become of him
but the church_of_christ like a tender loving mother holds aloof from active punishment herself as the sinner is too severely punished already by the civil law and there must be at least some one to have pity on him
the church_of_christ holds aloof above all because its judgment is the only one that contains the truth and therefore cannot practically and morally be united to any other judgment even as a temporary compromise
the foreign criminal they say rarely repents for the very doctrines of to day confirm him in the idea that his crime is not a crime but only a reaction against an unjustly oppressive force
society cuts him off completely by a force that triumphs over him mechanically and so at least they say of themselves in europe accompanies this exclusion with hatred forgetfulness and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate of the erring brother
in this way it all takes place without the compassionate intervention of the church_of_christ for in many cases there are no churches there at all for though ecclesiastics and splendid church_of_christ buildings remain
she can enter into no compact about that the churches themselves have long ago striven to pass from church_of_christ into state and to disappear in it completely
so it seems at least in lutheran country as for rome it was proclaimed a state instead of a church_of_christ a thousand years ago
and so the criminal is no longer conscious of being a member of the church_of_christ and sinks into despair if he returns to society often it is with such hatred that society itself instinctively cuts him off
in many cases it would seem to be the same with us but the difference is that besides the established law courts we have the church_of_christ too which always keeps up relations with the criminal as a dear and still precious son
and besides that there is still preserved though only in thought the judgment of the church_of_christ which though no longer existing in practice is still living as a dream for the future and is no doubt instinctively recognized by the criminal in his soul
what was said here just now is true too that is that if the jurisdiction of the church_of_christ were introduced in practice in its full force that is if the whole of the society were changed into the church_of_christ not only the judgment of the church_of_christ would have influence on the reformation of the criminal such as it never has now but possibly also the crimes themselves would be incredibly diminished
and there can be no doubt that the church_of_christ would look upon the criminal and the crime of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed in restoring the excluded in restraining those who plan evil and in regenerating the fallen
it is true said father_zossima with a smile the christian society now is not ready and is only resting on some seven righteous man but as they are never lacking it will continue still unshaken in expectation of its complete transformation from a society almost heathen in character into a single universal and all powerful church_of_christ
you can judge for yourself how it must end so be it so be it even though at the end of the ages for it is ordained to come to pass
and there is no need to be troubled about time and seasons for the secret of the time and seasons is in the wisdom of god in his foresight and his love
and what in human reckoning seems still afar off may by the divine ordinance be close at hand on the eve of its appearance
and so be it so be it so be it so be it father_zossima father_paďssy repeated austerely and reverently
strange extremely strange pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pronounced not so much with heat as with latent indignation what strikes you as so strange
cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov suddenly breaking out the state is eliminated and the church_of_christ is raised to the position of the state
father_zossima iosif inquired cautiously why it beyond anything it not simply ultramontanism it arch ultramontanism it beyond the dreams of pope gregory the seventh
you are completely misunderstanding it said father_zossima father_paďssy sternly understand the church_of_christ is not to be transformed into the state
on the contrary the state is transformed into the church_of_christ will ascend and become a church_of_christ over the whole world which is the complete opposite of ultramontanism and rome and your interpretation and is only the glorious destiny ordained for the orthodox church_of_christ
that is rome and its dream that is the third temptation of the devil this star will arise in the east
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov was significantly silent his whole figure expressed extraordinary personal dignity a supercilious and condescending smile played on his lips alyosha_karamazov watched it all with a throbbing heart
he glanced casually at mr_rakitin who was standing immovable in his place by the door listening and watching intently though with downcast eye
but from the color in his cheeks alyosha_karamazov guessed that mr_rakitin was probably no less excited and he knew what caused his excitement
the whole conversation stirred him profoundly allow me to tell you one little anecdote gentlemen pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov said impressively with a peculiarly majestic air
some years ago soon after the coup état of december i happened to be calling in paris on an extremely influential personage in the government and i met a very interesting man in his house
this individual was not precisely a detective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole regiment of political detectives a rather powerful position in its own way
and as he had not come as a visitor but as a subordinate official bringing a special report and as he saw the reception given me by his chief he deigned to speak with some openness to a certain extent only of course
i was prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of conversation with him he was rather courteous than open as frenchmen know how to be courteous especially to a foreigner
but i thoroughly understood him the subject was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted i will quote only one most curious remark dropped by this person
we are not particularly afraid said he of all these socialists anarchists infidels and revolutionists we keep watch on them and know all their goings on
but there are a few peculiar man among them who believe in god and are christians but at the same time are socialists
these are the people we are most afraid of they are dreadful people the socialist who is a christian is more to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist
the words struck me at the time and now they have suddenly come back to me here gentlemen you apply them to us and look upon us as socialists
but before pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov could think what to answer the door opened and the guest so long expected dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov came in
father_zossima father_paďssy asked directly without beating about the bush they had in fact given up expecting him and his sudden appearance caused some surprise for a moment
chapter vi why is such a man alive dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov a young man of eight and twenty of medium height and agreeable countenance looked older than his years
he was muscular and showed signs of considerable physical strength yet there was something not healthy in his face it was rather thin his cheeks were hollow and there was an unhealthy sallowness in their color
his rather large prominent dark eye had an expression of firm determination and yet there was a vague look in them too
even when he was excited and talking irritably his eye somehow did not follow his mood but betrayed something else sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing
people who saw something pensive and sullen in his eye were startled by his sudden laugh which bore witness to mirthful and light hearted thoughts at the very time when his eye were so gloomy
it hard to tell what he thinking those who talked to him sometimes declared a certain strained look in his face was easy to understand at this moment
every one knew or had heard of the extremely restless and dissipated life which he had been leading of late as well as of the violent anger to which he had been roused in his quarrels with his father_zossima
it is true that he was irascible by nature of an unstable and unbalanced mind as our justice of the peace katchalnikov happily described him
there were several stories current in the town about it he was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned frock coat
he wore black gloves and carried a top hat having only lately left the army he still had mustaches and no beard
his dark brown hair was cropped short and combed forward on his temples he had the long determined stride of a military man
he stood still for a moment on the threshold and glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder guessing him to be their host
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov kissed his hand respectfully and with intense feeling almost anger he said be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so long but smerdyakov the valet sent me by my father_zossima in reply to my inquiries told me twice over that the appointment was for one
he made him a low bow and asked his blessing father_zossima rising in his chair blessed him now i suddenly learn
dont disturb yourself interposed the elder no matter you are a little late it of no consequence i extremely obliged to you and expected no less from your goodness
saying this dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov bowed once more then turning suddenly towards his father_zossima made him too a similarly low and respectful bow
he had evidently considered it beforehand and made this bow in all seriousness thinking it his duty to show his respect and good intentions
in response to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov bow he jumped up from his chair and made his son a bow as low in return
although fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was taken unawares he was equal to the occasion his face was suddenly solemn and impressive which gave him a positively malignant look
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov bowed generally to all present and without a word walked to the window with his long resolute stride sat down on the only empty chair near father_zossima father_paďssy and bending forward prepared to listen to the conversation he had interrupted
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov entrance had taken no more than two minutes and the conversation was resumed but this time pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov thought it unnecessary to reply to father_zossima father_paďssy persistent and almost irritable question
allow me to withdraw from this discussion he observed with a certain well bred nonchalance it a subtle question too here ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is smiling at us
he must have something interesting to say about that also ask him nothing special except one little remark ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov replied at once
european liberals in general and even our liberal dilettanti often mix up the final results of socialism with those of christianity
but it not only liberals and dilettanti who mix up socialism and christianity but in many cases it appears the police the foreign police of course do the same
this wild notion is of course a characteristic feature your paris anecdote is rather to the point pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov
i ask your permission to drop this subject altogether pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov repeated i will tell you instead gentlemen another interesting and rather characteristic anecdote of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov himself
only five day ago in a gathering here principally of lady he solemnly declared in argument that there was nothing in the whole world to make man love their neighbors
that there was no law of nature that man should love mankind and that if there had been any love on earth hitherto it was not owing to a natural law but simply because man have believed in immortality
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in that faith and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in immortality not only love but every living force maintaining the life of the world would at once be dried up
he ended by asserting that for every individual like ourselves who does not believe in god or immortality the moral law of nature must immediately be changed into the exact contrary of the former religious law and that egoism even to crime must become not only lawful but even recognized as the inevitable the most rational even honorable outcome of his position
moreover nothing then would be immoral everything would be lawful even cannibalism that not all from this paradox gentlemen you can judge of the rest of our eccentric and paradoxical friend ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov theories
excuse me dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried suddenly if i ve heard aright crime must not only be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable and the most rational outcome of his position for every infidel
is that so or not quite so said father_zossima father_paďssy i ll remember it having uttered these words dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ceased speaking as suddenly as he had begun
is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the disappearance of the faith in immortality the elder asked ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly
every one looked at him with curiosity yes that was my contention there is no virtue if there is no immortality
because in all probability you dont believe yourself in the immortality of your soul nor in what you have written yourself in your article on church_of_christ jurisdiction
you are blessed in believing that or else most unhappy why unhappy ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov asked smiling perhaps you are right
but i wasnt altogether joking ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly and strangely confessed flushing quickly you were not altogether joking that true the question is still fretting your heart and not answered
meanwhile in your despair you too divert yourself with magazine articles and discussions in society though you dont believe your own arguments and with an aching heart mock at them inwardly
but the martyr likes sometimes to divert himself with his despair as it were driven to it by despair itself that question you have not answered and it is your great grief for it clamors for an answer
but can it be answered by me answered in the affirmative ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went on asking strangely still looking at the elder with the same inexplicable smile
if it cant be decided in the affirmative it will never be decided in the negative you know that that is the peculiarity of your heart and all its suffering is due to it
but thank the creator who has given you a lofty heart capable of such suffering of thinking and seeking higher things for our dwelling is in the heavens
god grant that your heart will attain the answer on earth and may god bless your path the elder raised his hand and would have made the sign of the cross over ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov from where he stood
but the latter rose from his seat went up to him received his blessing and kissing his hand went back to his place in silence
this action and all the preceding conversation which was so surprising from ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov impressed every one by its strangeness and a certain solemnity so that all were silent for a moment and there was a look almost of apprehension in alyosha_karamazov face
his face looked firm and earnest but pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov suddenly shrugged his shoulders and at the same moment fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov jumped up from his seat
most pious and holy elder he cried pointing to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that is my son flesh of my flesh the dearest of my flesh
he is my most dutiful karl_bernard moor so to speak while this son who has just come in dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov against whom i am seeking justice from you is the undutiful franz moor they are both out of schiller robbers and so i am the reigning count von moor
speak without buffoonery and dont begin by insulting the members of your family answered the elder in a faint exhausted voice
judge and save us we need not only your prayers but your prophecies he was obviously getting more and more fatigued and his strength was failing
an unseemly farce which i foresaw when i came here cried dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov indignantly he too leapt up forgive it reverend father_zossima he added addressing the elder
i am not a cultivated man and i dont even know how to address you properly but you have been deceived and you have been too good natured in letting us meet here
all my father_zossima wants is a scandal why he wants it only he can tell he always has some motive
but i believe i know why they all blame me all of them cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in his turn
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov here blames me too you have been blaming me pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov you have he turned suddenly to pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov although the latter was not dreaming of interrupting him
they all accuse me of having hidden the child money in my boots and cheated them but isnt there a court of law
there they will reckon out for you dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov from your notes your letters and your agreements how much money you had how much you have spent and how much you have left
because they are all against me while dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is in debt to me and not a little but some thousands of which i have documentary proof
why does pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov refuse to pass judgment dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov is not a stranger to him the whole town is echoing with his debauchery
and where he was stationed before he several time spent a thousand or two for the seduction of some respectable girl we know all about that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in its most secret details
would you believe it holy father_zossima he has captivated the heart of the most honorable of young lady of good family and fortune daughter of a gallant colonel formerly his superior officer who had received many honors and had the anna order on his breast
he compromised the girl by his promise of marriage now she is an orphan and here she is betrothed to him yet before her very eye he is dancing attendance on a certain enchantress
and although this enchantress has lived in so to speak civil marriage with a respectable man yet she is of an independent character an unapproachable fortress for everybody just like a legal wife
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov wants to open this fortress with a golden key and that why he is insolent to me now trying to get money from me though he has wasted thousands on this enchantress already
i ll prove it for she is virtuous yes holy fathers she is virtuous he continually borrowing money for the purpose from whom do you think
shall i say mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov be silent cried dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov wait till i gone dont dare in my presence to asperse the good name of an honorable girl
that you should utter a word about her is an outrage and i wont permit it he was breathless mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov hysterically squeezing out a tear and is your father_zossima blessing nothing to you if i curse you what then
shameless hypocrite exclaimed dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov furiously he says that to his father_zossima his father_zossima what would he be with others
gentlemen only fancy there a poor but honorable man living here burdened with a numerous family a captain who got into trouble and was discharged from the army but not publicly not by court martial with no slur on his honor
and three weeks ago dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov seized him by the beard in a tavern dragged him out into the street and beat him publicly and all because he is an agent in a little business of mine
it all a lie outwardly it the truth but inwardly a lie dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was trembling with rage father_zossima i dont justify my action
i behaved like a brute to that captain and i regret it now and i disgusted with myself for my brutal rage
but this captain this agent of yours went to that lady whom you call an enchantress and suggested to her from you that she should take i u of mine which were in your possession and should sue me for the money so as to get me into prison by means of them if i persisted in claiming an account from you of my property
yes i confess it publicly now you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when you yourself incited her to captivate me
you wanted to put me in prison because you are jealous of me with her because you begun to force your attentions upon her and i know all about that too she laughed at you for that as well you hear
she told me so to my face she told me the story and laughed at you she laughed at you as she described it
gentlemen forgive my anger but i foresaw that this crafty old man would only bring you together to create a scandal
so here you have this man this father_zossima who reproaches his profligate son i had come to forgive him if he held out his hand to forgive him and ask forgiveness
but as he has just this minute insulted not only me but an honorable young lady for whom i feel such reverence that i dare not take her name in vain i have made up my mind to show up his game though he is my father_zossima
he could not go on his eye were glittering and he breathed with difficulty but every one in the cell was stirred
all except father_zossima got up from their seats uneasily the monks looked austere but waited for guidance from the elder
an imploring smile lighted up his face from time to time he raised his hand as though to check the storm and of course a gesture from him would have been enough to end the scene but he seemed to be waiting for something and watched them intently as though trying to make out something which was not perfectly clear to him
he sat still pale not from excitement but from the weakness of disease at last pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov felt completely humiliated and disgraced
we are all to blame for this scandalous scene he said hotly but i did not foresee it when i came though i knew with whom i had to deal
believe me your reverence i had no precise knowledge of the details that have just come to light i was unwilling to believe them and i learn for the first time
a father_zossima is jealous of his son relations with a woman of loose behavior and intrigues with the creature to get his son into prison
this must be stopped at once this is the company in which i have been forced to be present i was deceived
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov yelled fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov suddenly in an unnatural voice if you were not my son i would challenge you this instant to a duel with pistol at three paces across a handkerchief he ended stamping with both feet
with old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments when they enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed tears of emotion in earnest although at that very moment or a second later they are able to whisper to themselves you know you are lying you shameless old sinner
i declare to you all that i was as much deceived as any one you re acting now in spite of your holy wrath
i thought he said in a soft and as it were controlled voice that i was coming to my native place with the angel of my heart my betrothed to cherish his old age and i find nothing but a depraved profligate a despicable clown
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov frowned painfully and looked with unutterable contempt at his father_zossima i thought a duel yelled the old wretch again breathless and spluttering at each syllable
and you pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov let me tell you that there has never been in all your family a loftier and more honest you hear more honest woman than this creature as you have dared to call her
and you dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov have abandoned your betrothed for that creature so you must yourself have thought that your betrothed couldnt hold a candle to her
that the woman called a creature shameful broke from father_zossima iosif shameful and disgraceful pyotr_fomitch_kalganov flushing crimson cried in a boyish voice trembling with emotion
he had been silent till that moment why is such a man alive dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov beside himself with rage growled in a hollow voice hunching up his shoulders till he looked almost deformed
tell me can he be allowed to go on defiling the earth he looked round at every one and pointed at the old man
he spoke evenly and deliberately listen listen monks to the parricide cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov rushing up to father_zossima iosif
that the answer to your shameful what is shameful that creature that woman of loose behavior is perhaps holier than you are yourselves
you monks who are seeking salvation she fell perhaps in her youth ruined by her environment but she loved much and church_of_christ himself forgave the woman who loved much
it was not for such love church_of_christ forgave her broke impatiently from the gentle father_zossima iosif yes it was for such monks it was
you save your soul here eating cabbage and think you are the righteous you eat a gudgeon a day and you think you bribe god with gudgeon
this is unendurable was heard on all sides in the cell but this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way
father_zossima rose suddenly from his seat almost distracted with anxiety for the elder and every one else alyosha_karamazov succeeded however in supporting him by the arm
father_zossima moved towards dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and reaching him sank on his knees before him alyosha_karamazov thought that he had fallen from weakness but this was not so
the elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov feet till his forehead touched the floor alyosha_karamazov was so astounded that he failed to assist him when he got up again
there was a faint smile on his lips good by forgive me all of you he said bowing on all sides to his guests
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov stood for a few moments in amazement bowing down to him what did it mean suddenly he cried aloud oh god hid his face in his hands and rushed out of the room
all the guests flocked out after him in their confusion not saying good by or bowing to their host only the monks went up to him again for a blessing
was it symbolic or what said fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov suddenly quieted and trying to reopen conversation without venturing to address anybody in particular
what did it mean falling at his feet like that they were all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage at the moment
i cant answer for a madhouse and for madmen pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov answered at once ill humoredly but i will spare myself your company fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and trust me for ever
where that monk that monk that is the monk who had invited them to dine with the superior did not keep them waiting
he met them as soon as they came down the steps from the elder cell as though he had been waiting for them all the time
convey my deepest respect to the father_zossima superior apologize for me personally pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov to his reverence telling him that i deeply regret that owing to unforeseen circumstances i am unable to have the honor of being present at his table greatly as i should desire to do so pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov said irritably to the monk
reverend father_zossima kindly do me a favor and that unforeseen circumstance of course is myself fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov cut in immediately
do you hear father_zossima this gentleman doesnt want to remain in my company or else he come at once and you shall go pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pray go to the father_zossima superior and good appetite to you
i will decline and not you home home i ll eat at home i dont feel equal to it here pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov my amiable relative
i said it on purpose to madden you because you always disclaim the relationship though you really are a relation in spite of your shuffling
i am not your relative and never have been you contemptible man i ll prove it by the church_of_christ calendar as for you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stay if you like
i ll send the horses for you later propriety requires you to go to the father_zossima superior pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov to apologize for the disturbance we ve been making
is it true that you are going home arent you lying pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov how could i dare after what happened
forgive me gentlemen i was carried away and upset besides and indeed i am ashamed gentlemen one man has the heart of alexander of macedon and another the heart of the little dog fido
mine is that of the little dog fido i am ashamed after such an escapade how can i go to dinner to gobble up the monastery sauces
i am ashamed i cant you must excuse me the devil only knows what if he deceives us thought pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov still hesitating and watching the retreating buffoon with distrustful eye
the latter turned round and noticing that pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov was watching him waved him a kiss well are you coming to the superior
unfortunately i feel myself compelled to go to this confounded dinner said pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov with the same irritability regardless of the fact that the monk was listening
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov asked ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov abruptly why not i was especially invited yesterday we ought at least to apologize for the disturbance and explain that it was not our doing
what do you think yes we must explain that it wasnt our doing besides father_zossima wont be there observed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
on the road through the copse he made one observation however that the father_zossima superior had been waiting a long time and that they were more than half an hour late
well i should hope not confound this dinner they all walked on however the monk listened in silence he received no answer
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov looked with hatred at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov here he is going to the dinner as though nothing had happened he thought
a brazen face and the conscience of a alyosha_karamazov chapter vii a young man bent on a career alyosha_karamazov helped father_zossima to his bedroom and seated him on his bed
it was a little room furnished with the bare necessities there was a narrow iron bedstead with a strip of felt for a mattress
in the corner under the ikons was a reading desk with a cross and the gospel lying on it the elder sank exhausted on the bed
his eye glittered and he breathed hard he looked intently at alyosha_karamazov as though considering something go my dear boy go
porfiry is enough for me make haste you are needed there go and wait at the father_zossima superior table let me stay here alyosha_karamazov entreated
you are more needed there there is no peace there you will wait and be of service if evil spirits rise up repeat a prayer
and remember my son the elder liked to call him that this is not the place for you in the future when it is god will to call me leave the monastery
go away for good alyosha_karamazov started what is it this is not your place for the time i bless you for great service in the world
yours will be a long pilgrimage and you will have to take a wife too you will have to bear all before you come back
there will be much to do but i dont doubt of you and so i send you forth church_of_christ is with you
do not abandon him and he will not abandon you you will see great sorrow and in that sorrow you will be happy
this is my last message to you in sorrow seek happiness work work unceasingly remember my words for although i shall talk with you again not only my day
but my hours are numbered alyosha_karamazov face again betrayed strong emotion the corners of his mouth quivered what is it again
father_zossima asked smiling gently the worldly may follow the dead with tears but here we rejoice over the father_zossima who is departing
we rejoice and pray for him leave me i must pray go and make haste be near your brothers and not near one only but near both
father_zossima raised his hand to bless him alyosha_karamazov could make no protest though he had a great longing to remain
he longed moreover to ask the significance of his bowing to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov the question was on the tip of his tongue but he dared not ask it
he knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he had thought fit but evidently it was not his will
as he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in time to serve at the father_zossima superior dinner he felt a sudden pang at his heart and stopped short
that action had made a terrible impression on alyosha_karamazov he believed blindly in its mysterious significance mysterious and perhaps awful he seemed to hear again father_zossima words foretelling his approaching end
what he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass alyosha_karamazov believed that implicitly but how could he be left without him
how could he live without seeing and hearing him where should he go he had told him not to weep and to leave the monastery
he hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts he gazed at the ancient pines beside the path
good god it was long since alyosha_karamazov had known such anguish he had not far to go about five hundred paces he expected to meet no one at that hour but at the first turn of the path he noticed mr_rakitin
he was waiting for some one are you waiting for me asked alyosha_karamazov overtaking him yes grinned mr_rakitin
you are hurrying to the father_zossima superior i know he has a banquet there not been such a banquet since the superior entertained the bishop and general pahatov do you remember
i shant be there but you go and hand the sauces tell me one thing alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov what does that vision mean
that what i want to ask you what vision that bowing to your brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and didnt he tap the ground with his forehead too
you speak of father_zossima yes of father_zossima tapped the ground ah an irreverent expression well what of it
anyway what does that vision mean i dont know what it means misha i knew he wouldnt explain it to you
all the pious people in the town will talk about it and spread the story through the province wondering what it meant
there nothing wonderful about it of course only the usual holy mummery but there was an object in the performance to my thinking the old man really has a keen nose he sniffed a crime
your house stinks of it what crime mr_rakitin evidently had something he was eager to speak of
it ll be in your family this crime between your brothers and your rich old father_zossima so father_zossima flopped down to be ready for what may turn up
if something happens later on it ll be ah the holy man foresaw it prophesied it though it a poor sort of prophecy flopping like that
ah but it was symbolic they ll say an allegory and the devil knows what all it ll be remembered to his glory
he predicted the crime and marked the criminal that always the way with these crazy fanatics they cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple
like your elder he takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a murderer
what crime what murderer what do you mean alyosha_karamazov stopped dead mr_rakitin stopped too what murderer as though you didnt know
i ll bet you ve thought of it before that interesting too by the way listen alyosha_karamazov you always speak the truth though you re always between two stools
have you thought of it or not answer i have answered alyosha_karamazov in a low voice even mr_rakitin was taken aback
what have you really he cried i i ve not exactly thought it muttered alyosha_karamazov but directly you began speaking so strangely
i fancied i had thought of it myself you see and how well you expressed it looking at your father_zossima and your brother mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to day you thought of a crime
then i not mistaken but wait wait a minute alyosha_karamazov broke in uneasily what has led you to see all this
why does it interest you that the first question two questions disconnected but natural i ll deal with them separately what led me to see it
i shouldnt have seen it if i hadnt suddenly understood your brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov seen right into the very heart of him all at once
i caught the whole man from one trait these very honest but passionate people have a line which mustnt be crossed
but your father_zossima a drunken and abandoned old sinner who can never draw the line if they both let themselves go they ll both come to grief
if it were he run at your father_zossima with a knife no misha no if that all you ve reassured me it wont come to that
but why are you trembling let me tell you he may be honest our mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he is stupid but honest but he a sensualist
that the very definition and inner essence of him it your father_zossima has handed him on his low sensuality do you know i simply wonder at you
alyosha_karamazov how you can have kept your purity you re a alyosha_karamazov too you know in your family sensuality is carried to a disease
but now these three sensualists are watching one another with their knives in their belts the three of them are knocking their heads together and you may be the fourth
you are mistaken about that woman dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov despises her said alyosha_karamazov with a sort of shudder grushenka no brother he doesnt despise her
since he has openly abandoned his betrothed for her he doesnt despise her there something here my dear boy that you dont understand yet
a man will fall in love with some beauty with a woman body or even with a part of a woman body a sensualist can understand that and he ll abandon his own child for her sell his father_zossima and mother and his country russia too
if he honest he ll steal if he humane he ll murder if he faithful he ll deceive pushkin the poet of women feet sung of their feet in his verse
others dont sing their praises but they cant look at their feet without a thrill and it not only their feet contempt no help here brother even if he did despise grushenka
he does but he cant tear himself away i understand that alyosha_karamazov jerked out suddenly really well i dare say you do understand since you blurt it out at the first word said mr_rakitin malignantly
that escaped you unawares and the confession the more precious so it a familiar subject you ve thought about it already about sensuality i mean
you re a quiet one alyosha_karamazov you re a saint i know but the devil only knows what you ve thought about and what you know already
oh you virgin soul you are pure but you ve been down into the depths i ve been watching you a long time
you re a alyosha_karamazov yourself you re a thorough alyosha_karamazov no doubt birth and selection have something to answer for you re a sensualist from your father_zossima a crazy saint from your mother
why do you tremble is it true then do you know grushenka has been begging me to bring you along
i ll pull off his cassock she says you cant think how she keeps begging me to bring you i wondered why she took such an interest in you
do you know she an extraordinary woman too thank her and say i not coming said alyosha_karamazov with a strained smile
finish what you were saying misha i ll tell you my idea after there nothing to finish it all clear
it the same old tune brother if even you are a sensualist at heart what of your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he a alyosha_karamazov too
your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov writes theological articles in joke for some idiotic unknown motive of his own though he an atheist and he admits it a fraud himself that your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
what is at the root of all you karamazovs is that you re all sensual grasping and crazy he trying to get mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov betrothed for himself and i fancy he ll succeed too
and what more it with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov consent for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov will surrender his betrothed to him to be rid of her and escape to grushenka
and he ready to do that in spite of all his nobility and disinterestedness observe that those are the most fatal people
who the devil can make you out he recognizes his vileness and goes on with it let me tell you too the old man your father_zossima is standing in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov way now
it simply on her account he made that scene in the cell just now simply because pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov called her an abandoned creature
he has suddenly gone crazy over grushenka his mouth waters at the sight of her he worse than a tom cat in love
at first she was only employed by him in connection with his taverns and in some other shady business but now he has suddenly realized all she is and has gone wild about her
he keeps pestering her with his offers not honorable ones of course and they ll come into collision the precious father_zossima and son on that path
but grushenka favors neither of them she still playing with them and teasing them both considering which she can get most out of
for though she could filch a lot of money from the papa he wouldnt marry her and maybe he ll turn stingy in the end and keep his purse shut
that where mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov value comes in he has no money but he ready to marry her yes ready to marry her
to abandon his betrothed a rare beauty katerina_ivanovna who rich and the daughter of a colonel and to marry grushenka who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov a coarse uneducated provincial mayor
some murderous conflict may well come to pass from all this and that what your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is waiting for it would suit him down to the ground
he ll carry off katerina_ivanovna for whom he is languishing and pocket her dowry of sixty thousand that very alluring to start with for a man of no consequence and a beggar
for i know as a fact that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov only last week when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern cried out aloud that he was unworthy of his betrothed katya but that his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he was the man who deserved her
and take note he wont be wronging mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov but doing him the greatest service and katerina_ivanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
she hesitating between the two of them already and how has that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov won you all so that you all worship him
he is laughing at you and enjoying himself at your expense how do you know how can you speak so confidently
alyosha_karamazov asked sharply frowning why do you ask and are frightened at my answer it shows that you know i speaking the truth
you dont like ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan wouldnt be tempted by money really and the beauty of katerina_ivanovna it not only the money though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is above that he wouldnt make up to any one for thousands it is not money it not comfort ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is seeking
perhaps it suffering he is seeking what wild dream now oh you aristocrats ah misha he has a stormy spirit his mind is in bondage
he is haunted by a great unsolved doubt he is one of those who dont want millions but an answer to their questions
that plagiarism alyosha_karamazov you re quoting your elder phrases ah ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has set you a problem cried mr_rakitin with undisguised malice
his face changed and his lips twitched and the problem a stupid one it is no good guessing it rack your brains you ll understand it
and did you hear his stupid theory just now if there no immortality of the soul then there no virtue and everything is lawful
his article is absurd and ridiculous and by the way do you remember how your brother mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried out i will remember
an attractive theory for scoundrels i being abusive that stupid not for scoundrels but for pedantic poseurs haunted by profound unsolved doubts
he showing off and what it all comes to is on the one hand we cannot but admit and on the other it must be confessed
his whole theory is a fraud humanity will find in itself the power to live for virtue even without believing in immortality
it will find it in love for freedom for equality for fraternity mr_rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his heat but suddenly as though remembering something he stopped short
well that enough he said with a still more crooked smile why are you laughing do you think i a vulgar fool
no i never dreamed of thinking you a vulgar fool you are clever but never mind i was silly to smile
i guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent to katerina_ivanovna yourself i ve suspected that for a long time brother that why you dont like my brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
i understand your getting hot about it misha are you jealous of him and jealous of her money too wont you add that
i ll say nothing about money i am not going to insult you i believe it since you say so but confound you and your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with you
dont you understand that one might very well dislike him apart from katerina_ivanovna and why the devil should i like him
he condescends to abuse me you know why havent i a right to abuse him i never heard of his saying anything about you good or bad
but i heard that the day before yesterday at katerina_ivanovna he was abusing me for all he was worth you see what an interest he takes in your humble servant
he was so good as to express the opinion that if i dont go in for the career of an archimandrite in the immediate future and dont become a monk i shall be sure to go to petersburg and get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer that i shall write for the next ten years and in the end become the owner of the magazine and bring it out on the liberal and atheistic side with a socialistic tinge with a tiny gloss of socialism but keeping a sharp look out all the time that is keeping in with both sides and hoodwinking the fools
according to your brother account the tinge of socialism wont hinder me from laying by the proceeds and investing them under the guidance of some jew till at the end of my career i build a great house in petersburg and move my publishing office to it and let out the upper stories to lodgers
he has even chosen the place for it near the new stone bridge across the neva which they say is to be built in petersburg
he doesnt speak of you at all and which is the jealous one after that brother i cant say ah misha that just what will really happen every word of it cried alyosha_karamazov unable to restrain a good humored smile
you are pleased to be sarcastic too alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov no no i joking forgive me i ve something quite different in my mind
but excuse me who can have told you all this you cant have been at katerina_ivanovna yourself when he was talking about you
i wasnt there but dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was and i heard him tell it with my own ears if you want to know he didnt tell me but i overheard him unintentionally of course for i was sitting in grushenka bedroom
and i couldnt go away because dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was in the next room oh yes i forgotten she was a relation of yours
a relation that grushenka a relation of mine cried mr_rakitin turning crimson are you mad you re out of your mind
you karamazovs brag of being an ancient noble family though your father_zossima used to run about playing the buffoon at other man tables and was only admitted to the kitchen as a favor
i may be only a priest son and dirt in the eye of noblemen like you but dont insult me so lightly and wantonly
why isnt she a relation of yours i heard so where can you have heard it i have a sense of honor too alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i couldnt be a relation of grushenka a common harlot
i beg you to understand that mr_rakitin was intensely irritated forgive me for goodness sake i had no idea besides how can you call her a harlot
is she that sort of woman alyosha_karamazov flushed suddenly i tell you again i heard that she was a relation of yours
you often go to see her and you told me yourself you re not her lover i never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her
does she really deserve it i may have reason of my own for visiting her that not your business but as for relationship your brother or even your father_zossima is more likely to make her yours than mine
well here we are you better go to the kitchen hullo what wrong what is it are we late they cant have finished dinner so soon
have the karamazovs been making trouble again no doubt they have here your father_zossima and your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov after him they ve broken out from the father_zossima superior
and look father_zossima isidor shouting out something after them from the steps and your father_zossima shouting and waving his arms i expect he swearing
bah and there goes pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov driving away in his carriage you see he going and there old maximov running there must have been a row
there cant have been any dinner surely they ve not been beating the father_zossima superior or have they perhaps been beaten it would serve them right
there was reason for mr_rakitin exclamations there had been a scandalous an unprecedented scene it had all come from the impulse of a moment
the scandalous scene pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov as a man of breeding and delicacy could not but feel some inward qualms when he reached the father_zossima superior with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he felt ashamed of having lost his temper
he felt that he ought to have disdained that despicable wretch fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov too much to have been upset by him in father_zossima cell and so to have forgotten himself
and if they re decent people here and the father_zossima superior i understand is a nobleman why not be friendly and courteous with them
i wont argue i ll fall in with everything i ll win them by politeness and and show them that i ve nothing to do with that ćsop that buffoon that pierrot and have merely been taken in over this affair just as they have
he determined to drop his litigation with the monastery and relinquish his claims to the wood cutting and fishery rights at once
he was the more ready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question were
these excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the father_zossima superior dining room though strictly speaking it was not a dining room
chapter viii the monks were not to blame in any case he reflected on the steps for the father_zossima superior had only two rooms altogether they were however much larger and more comfortable than father_zossima
the furniture was of mahogany covered with leather in the old fashioned style of the floor was not even stained but everything was shining with cleanliness and there were many choice flowers in the windows
but there was no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was of course the beautifully decorated table
the cloth was clean the service shone there were three kind of well baked bread two bottles of wine two of excellent mead and a large glass jug of kvas both the latter made in the monastery and famous in the neighborhood
mr_rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes fish soup made of sterlets served with little fish patties then boiled fish served in a special way then salmon cutlets ice pudding and compote and finally blanc mange
mr_rakitin found out about all these good things for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen where he already had a footing
there was no vodka he had a footing everywhere and got information about everything he was of an uneasy and envious temper
he knew he would play a prominent part of some sort but alyosha_karamazov who was attached to him was distressed to see that his friend mr_rakitin was dishonorable and quite unconscious of being so himself considering on the contrary that because he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity
he was well aware of his own considerable abilities and nervously exaggerated them in his self conceit neither alyosha_karamazov nor any one else could have influenced him in that
mr_rakitin of course was a person of too little consequence to be invited to the dinner to which father_zossima iosif father_zossima father_paďssy and one other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited
they were already waiting when pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_fomitch_kalganov and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov arrived the other guest maximov stood a little aside waiting also the father_zossima superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests
he was a tall thin but still vigorous old man with black hair streaked with gray and a long grave ascetic face
he bowed to his guests in silence but this time they approached to receive his blessing pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov even tried to kiss his hand but the father_zossima superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute
but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and pyotr_fomitch_kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple hearted and complete manner kissing his hand as peasants do
we must apologize most humbly your reverence began pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov simpering affably and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone
pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov he felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitality and not without reason
in the reverend father_zossima cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissension with his son and let fall words which were quite out of keeping in fact quite unseemly
and therefore recognizing that he had been to blame he felt sincere regret and shame and begged me and his son ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to convey to you his apologies and regrets
as he glanced at the monks your reverence is no doubt already aware in brief he hopes and desires to make amends later
as he uttered the last word of his tirade pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov completely recovered his self complacency and all traces of his former irritation disappeared
he asks your blessing and begs you to forget what has taken place he fully and sincerely loved humanity again
the father_zossima superior listened to him with dignity and with a slight bend of the head replied i sincerely deplore his absence
perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us and we him pray be seated gentlemen he stood before the holy image and began to say grace aloud
all bent their heads reverently and maximov clasped his hands before him with peculiar fervor it was at this moment that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov played his last prank
it must be noted that he really had meant to go home and really had felt the impossibility of going to dine with the father_zossima superior as though nothing had happened after his disgraceful behavior in the elder cell
not that he was so very much ashamed of himself quite the contrary perhaps but still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner
yet his creaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel and he had hardly got into it when he suddenly stopped short
he remembered his own words at the elder i always feel when i meet people that i am lower than all and that they all take me for a buffoon so i say let me play the buffoon for you are every one of you stupider and lower than i_
he suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked why do you hate so and so so much
he longed to revenge himself on every one for his own unseemliness and he had answered them with his shameless impudence i ll tell you
he has done me no harm but i played him a dirty trick and ever since i have hated him
remembering that now he smiled quietly and malignantly hesitating for a moment his eye gleamed and his lips positively quivered
well since i have begun i may as well go on he decided his predominant sensation at that moment might be expressed in the following words well there is no rehabilitating myself now
so let me shame them for all i am worth i will show them i dont care what they think that all
he told the coachman to wait while with rapid steps he returned to the monastery and straight to the father_zossima superior
he had no clear idea what he would do but he knew that he could not control himself and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obscenity but only to obscenity to nothing criminal nothing for which he could be legally punished
he appeared in the father_zossima superior dining room at the moment when the prayer was over and all were moving to the table
standing in the doorway he scanned the company and laughing his prolonged impudent malicious chuckle looked them all boldly in the face
in the last resort he could always restrain himself and had marveled indeed at himself on that score sometimes they thought i had gone and here i am again he cried to the whole room
for one moment every one stared at him without a word and at once every one felt that something revolting grotesque positively scandalous was about to happen
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov passed immediately from the most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage all the feeling that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly
no this i cannot endure he cried i absolutely cannot and i certainly cannot the blood rushed to his head
he positively stammered but he was beyond thinking of style and he seized his hat what is it he cannot
cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov that he absolutely cannot and certainly cannot your reverence am i to come in or not will you receive me as your guest
he added i venture to beg you most earnestly to lay aside your dissensions and to be united in love and family harmony with prayer to the lord at our humble table
you are welcome with all my heart answered the superior gentlemen no no it is impossible cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov beside himself
well if it is impossible for pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov it is impossible for me and i wont stop that is why i came
i will keep with pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov everywhere now if you will go away pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov i will go away too if you remain i will remain
you stung him by what you said about family harmony father_zossima superior he does not admit he is my relation
that right isnt it von_sohn here von_sohn how are you von_sohn do you mean me muttered maximov puzzled
of course i mean you cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who else the father_zossima superior could not be von_sohn
but i am not von_sohn either i am maximov no you are von_sohn your reverence do you know who von_sohn was
he was killed in a house of harlotry i believe that is what such places are called among you he was killed and robbed and in spite of his venerable age he was nailed up in a box and sent from petersburg to moscow in the luggage van and while they were nailing him up the harlots sang songs and played the harp that is to say the piano
it was a famous murder case so this is that very von_sohn he has risen from the dead hasnt he von_sohn
what is happening what this voices were heard in the group of monks let us go cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov addressing pyotr_fomitch_kalganov
no excuse me fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov broke in shrilly taking another step into the room allow me to finish there in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because i spoke of eating gudgeon pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov my relation prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincérité in his words but i prefer in mine plus de sincérité que de noblesse and
allow me father_zossima superior though i am a buffoon and play the buffoon yet i am the soul of honor and i want to speak my mind
damn the noblesse that right isnt it von_sohn yes i am the soul of honor while in pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov there is wounded vanity and nothing else
i came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind my son alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov is here being saved i am his father_zossima i care for his welfare and it is my duty to care
while i ve been playing the fool i have been listening and having a look on the sly and now i want to give you the last act of the performance
you know how things are with us as a thing falls so it lies as a thing once has fallen so it must lie for ever
confession is a great sacrament before which i am ready to bow down reverently but there in the cell they all kneel down and confess aloud
not a bit of it i want to get up again holy father_zossima i am indignant with you can it be right to confess aloud
it was ordained by the holy fathers to confess in secret then only your confession will be a mystery and so it was of old
and that well you understand what sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it so it is really a scandal
no fathers one might be carried along with you to the flagellants i dare say at the first opportunity i shall write to the synod and i shall take my son alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov home
but how can i explain to him before every one that i did this we must note here that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov knew where to look for the weak spot
there had been at one time malicious rumor which had even reached the archbishop not only regarding our monastery but in others where the institution of elders existed that too much respect was paid to the elders even to the detriment of the authority of the superior that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on absurd charge which had died away of themselves everywhere
but the spirit of folly which had caught up fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and was bearing him on the current of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy prompted him with this old slander
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov did not understand a word of it and he could not even put it sensibly for on this occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elder cell so that he could not have seen anything of the kind
but as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense and at once longed to prove to his audience and above all to himself that he had not been talking nonsense
and though he knew perfectly well that with each word he would be adding more and more absurdity he could not restrain himself and plunged forward blindly
he was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders how disgraceful cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pardon me said the father_zossima superior
and hearing it i have said to myself it is the correction of the lord and he has sent it to heal my vain soul
it was said of old many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me and so we humbly thank you honored guest
and he made fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov a low bow tut tut tut sanctimoniousness and stock phrases old phrases and old gestures the old lies and formal prostrations
we know all about them a kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart as in schiller robbers
i dont like falsehood fathers i want the truth but the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that i proclaim aloud
father_zossima monks why do you fast why do you expect reward in heaven for that why for reward like that i will come and fast too
no saintly monk you try being virtuous in the world do good to society without shutting yourself up in a monastery at other people expense and without expecting a reward up aloft for it you ll find that a bit harder
i can talk sense too father_zossima superior what have they got here he went up to the table old port wine mead brewed by the eliseyev brothers
fie fie fathers that is something beyond gudgeon look at the bottles the fathers have brought out he he he and who has provided it all
the russian peasant the laborer brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand wringing it from his family and the tax gatherer
you bleed the people you know holy fathers this is too disgraceful said father_zossima iosif father_zossima father_paďssy kept obstinately silent
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov rushed from the room and pyotr_fomitch_kalganov after him well father_zossima i will follow pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov i am not coming to see you again
you may beg me on your knees i shant come i sent you a thousand roubles so you have begun to keep your eye on me
he he he no i ll say no more i am taking my revenge for my youth for all the humiliation i endured
he thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feeling this monastery has played a great part in my life
it has cost me many bitter tears you used to set my wife the crazy one against me you cursed me with bell and book you spread stories about me all over the place
enough fathers this is the age of liberalism the age of steamers and railways neither a thousand nor a hundred roubles no nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me
it must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his life and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it
but he was so carried away by his simulated emotion that he was for one moment almost believing it himself
he was so touched he was almost weeping but at that very instant he felt that it was time to draw back
the father_zossima superior bowed his head at his malicious lie and again spoke impressively it is written again bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee
and so will we tut tut tut bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole bethink yourselves fathers i will go
but i will take my son alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov away from here for ever on my parental authority ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov my most dutiful son permit me to order you to follow me
von_sohn what have you to stay for come and see me now in the town it is fun there it is only one short verst instead of lenten oil i will give you sucking pig and kasha
we will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it i ve cloudberry wine hey von_sohn dont lose your chance
he went out shouting and gesticulating it was at that moment mr_rakitin saw him and pointed him out to alyosha_karamazov
alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov his father_zossima shouted from far off catching sight of him you come home to me to day for good and bring your pillow and mattress and leave no trace behind
meanwhile fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had got into the carriage and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was about to follow him in grim silence without even turning to say good by to alyosha_karamazov
alyosha_karamazov stood rooted to the spot watching the scene in silence but at this point another almost incredible scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode
maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage he ran up panting afraid of being too late mr_rakitin and alyosha_karamazov saw him running
he was in such a hurry that in his impatience he put his foot on the step on which ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov left foot was still resting and clutching the carriage he kept trying to jump in
i am going with you he kept shouting laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face
take me too there cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov delighted did i not say he was von_sohn it is von_sohn himself risen from the dead
why how did you tear yourself away what did you vonsohn there and how could you get away from the dinner
you must be a brazen faced fellow i am that myself but i am surprised at you brother jump in jump in
let him pass ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov it will be fun he can lie somewhere at our feet will you lie at our feet von_sohn
but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov who had by now taken his seat without a word gave maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him flying
or perch on the box with the coachman skip on to the box von_sohn it was quite by chance he did not fall
drive on ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov shouted angrily to the coachman why what are you doing what are you about why did you do that
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov protested but the carriage had already driven away ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov made no reply well you are a fellow fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov said again
after a pause of two minutes looking askance at his son why it was you got up all this monastery business
you urged it you approved of it why are you angry now you ve talked rot enough you might rest a bit now ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov snapped sullenly
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was silent again for two minutes a drop of brandy would be nice now he observed sententiously but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov made no response
you shall have some too when we get home ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was still silent fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov waited another two minutes
but i shall take alyosha_karamazov away from the monastery though you will dislike it so much most honored karl_bernard von moor
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov shrugged his shoulders contemptuously and turning away stared at the road and they did not speak again all the way home
in the servants quarters the karamazovs house was far from being in the center of the town but it was not quite outside it
book iii the sensualists chapter i it was a pleasant looking old house of two stories painted gray with a red iron roof
it was roomy and snug and might still last many years there were all sort of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases
there were rats in it but fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov did not altogether dislike them one doesnt feel so solitary when one left alone in the evening he used to say
it was his habit to send the servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up alone
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov used to have the cooking done there although there was a kitchen in the house he did not like the smell of cooking and winter and summer alike the dishes were carried in across the courtyard
the lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard the house was built for a large family there was room for five time as many with their servants
but at the time of our story there was no one living in the house but fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and his son ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
and in the lodge there were only three servants old grigory_vassilyevitch and his old wife marfa and a young man called smerdyakov
he was firm and determined and went blindly and obstinately for his object if once he had been brought by any reason and they were often very illogical ones to believe that it was immutably right
of these three we must say a few words of old grigory_vassilyevitch we have said something already he was honest and incorruptible
his wife marfa_ignatyevna had obeyed her husband will implicitly all her life yet she had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the serfs
but grigory_vassilyevitch decided then once for all that the woman talking nonsense for every woman is dishonest and that they ought not to leave their old master whatever he might be for that was now their duty
she was set on leaving fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and opening a little shop in moscow with their small savings do you understand what duty is
he asked marfa_ignatyevna i understand what duty means grigory_vassilyevitch but why it our duty to stay here
i never shall understand marfa answered firmly well dont understand then but so it shall be and you hold your tongue
and so it was they did not go away and fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov promised them a small sum for wages and paid it regularly
grigory_vassilyevitch knew too that he had an indisputable influence over his master it was true and he was aware of it
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was an obstinate and cunning buffoon yet though his will was strong enough in some of the affairs of life as he expressed it he found himself to his surprise extremely feeble in facing certain other emergencies
he knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them there are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out
many time in the course of his life fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had only just escaped a sound thrashing through grigory_vassilyevitch intervention and on each occasion the old servant gave him a good lecture
and that not easy without a trustworthy man and grigory_vassilyevitch was a most trustworthy man but it wasnt only thrashings that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was afraid of
there were graver occasions and very subtle and complicated ones when fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov could not have explained the extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a moment
corrupt and often cruel in his lust like some noxious insect fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was sometimes in moments of drunkenness overcome by superstitious terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form
it was almost a morbid condition my soul simply quaking in my throat at those time he used to say
at such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand in the lodge if not in the room a strong faithful man virtuous and unlike himself who had seen all his debauchery and knew all his secrets but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that not to oppose him above all not to reproach him or threaten him with anything either in this world or in the next and in case of need to defend him from whom
what he needed was to feel that there was another man an old and tried friend that he might call him in his sick moments merely to look at his face or perhaps exchange some quite irrelevant words with him
from somebody unknown but terrible and dangerous and if the old servant were not angry he felt comforted and if he were angry he was more dejected
it happened even very rarely however that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov went at night to the lodge to wake grigory_vassilyevitch and fetch him for a moment
when the old man came fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov would begin talking about the most trivial matters and would soon let him go again sometimes even with a jest
and after he had gone fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov would get into bed with a curse and sleep the sleep of the just
something of the same sort had happened to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov on alyosha_karamazov arrival alyosha_karamazov pierced his heart by living with him seeing everything and blaming nothing
moreover alyosha_karamazov brought with him something his father_zossima had never known before a complete absence of contempt for him and an invariable kindness a perfectly natural unaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little
all this was a complete surprise to the old profligate who had dropped all family ties it was a new and surprising experience for him who had till then loved nothing but evil
when alyosha_karamazov had left him he confessed to himself that he had learnt something he had not till then been willing to learn
i have mentioned already that grigory_vassilyevitch had detested adelaďda_ivanovna the first wife of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and the mother of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and that he had on the contrary protected sofya ivanovna the poor crazy woman against his master and any one who chanced to speak ill or lightly of her
his sympathy for the unhappy wife had become something sacred to him so that even now twenty years after he could not bear a slighting allusion to her from any one and would at once check the offender
it was impossible to tell at first sight whether he loved his meek obedient wife but he really did love her and she knew it
marfa_ignatyevna was by no means foolish she was probably indeed cleverer than her husband or at least more prudent than he in worldly affairs
and yet she had given in to him in everything without question or complaint ever since her marriage and respected him for his spiritual superiority
it was remarkable how little they spoke to one another in the course of their lives and only of the most necessary daily affairs
the grave and dignified grigory_vassilyevitch thought over all his cares and duties alone so that marfa_ignatyevna had long grown used to knowing that he did not need her advice
externally grigory_vassilyevitch was cold dignified and taciturn and spoke weighing his words without frivolity she felt that her husband respected her silence and took it as a sign of her good sense
once during the year after fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov marriage with adelaďda_ivanovna the village girls and women at that time serfs were called together before the house to sing and dance
in the green meadows when marfa at that time a young woman skipped forward and danced the russian dance not in the village fashion but as she had danced it when she was a servant in the service of the rich pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov family in their private theater where the actors were taught to dance by a dancing master from moscow
grigory_vassilyevitch saw how his wife danced and an hour later at home in their cottage he gave her a lesson pulling her hair a little
he had never beaten her but once and then only slightly they were beginning but there it ended the beating was never repeated and marfa_ignatyevna gave up dancing
god had not blessed them with child one child was born but it died grigory_vassilyevitch was fond of child and was not ashamed of showing it
when adelaďda_ivanovna had run away grigory_vassilyevitch took dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov then a child of three years old combed his hair and washed him in a tub with his own hands and looked after him for almost a year
afterwards he had looked after ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and alyosha_karamazov for which the general widow had rewarded him with a slap in the face but i have already related all that
the only happiness his own child had brought him had been in the anticipation of its birth when it was born he was overwhelmed with grief and horror
grigory_vassilyevitch was so crushed by this that he was not only silent till the day of the christening but kept away in the garden
the baby had six fingers it was spring and he spent three day digging the kitchen garden the third day was fixed for christening the baby mean time grigory_vassilyevitch had reached a conclusion
going into the cottage where the clergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived including fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who was to stand god father_zossima he suddenly announced that the baby ought not to be christened at all
he announced this quietly briefly forcing out his words and gazing with dull intentness at the priest why not
asked the priest with good humored surprise because it a dragon muttered grigory_vassilyevitch a dragon what dragon grigory_vassilyevitch did not speak for some time
it a confusion of nature he muttered vaguely but firmly and obviously unwilling to say more they laughed and of course christened the poor baby
grigory_vassilyevitch prayed earnestly at the font but his opinion of the new born child remained unchanged yet he did not interfere in any way
as long as the sickly infant lived he scarcely looked at it tried indeed not to notice it and for the most part kept out of the cottage
but when at the end of a fortnight the baby died of thrush he himself laid the child in its little coffin looked at it in profound grief and when they were filling up the shallow little grave he fell on his knees and bowed down to the earth
he did not for years afterwards mention his child nor did marfa speak of the baby before him and even if grigory_vassilyevitch were not present she never spoke of it above a whisper
marfa observed that from the day of the burial he devoted himself to religion and took to reading the lives of the saints for the most part sitting alone and in silence and always putting on his big round silver rimmed spectacles
he was fond of the book of job and had somehow got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of the god fearing father_zossima isaac the syrian which he read persistently for years together understanding very little of it but perhaps prizing and loving it the more for that
he rarely read aloud only perhaps in lent of late he had begun to listen to the doctrines of the sect of flagellants settled in the neighborhood
he was evidently shaken by them but judged it unfitting to go over to the new faith his habit of theological reading gave him an expression of still greater gravity
and the birth of his deformed child and its death had as though by special design been accompanied by another strange and marvelous event which as he said later had left a stamp upon his soul
it happened that on the very night after the burial of his child marfa was awakened by the wail of a new born baby
he was perhaps predisposed to mysticism she was frightened and waked her husband he listened and said he thought it was more like some one groaning it might be a woman
he got up and dressed it was a rather warm night in may as he went down the steps he distinctly heard groans coming from the garden
but the gate from the yard into the garden was locked at night and there was no other way of entering it for it was enclosed all round by a strong high fence
going back into the house grigory_vassilyevitch lighted a lantern took the garden key and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying and that it was her own baby crying and calling for her went into the garden in silence
there he heard at once that the groans came from the bath house that stood near the garden gate and that they were the groans of a woman
an idiot girl who wandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of lizaveta smerdyastchaya stinking lizaveta had got into the bath house and had just given birth to a child
opening the door of the bath house he saw a sight which petrified him she lay dying with the baby beside her
she said nothing for she had never been able to speak but her story needs a chapter to itself chapter ii
this lizaveta was a dwarfish creature not five foot within a wee bit as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her after her death
her broad healthy red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in her eye was unpleasant in spite of their meek expression
lizaveta there was one circumstance which struck grigory_vassilyevitch particularly and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion she wandered about summer and winter alike barefooted wearing nothing but a hempen smock
it was always crusted with mud and had leaves bits of stick and shavings clinging to it as she always slept on the ground and in the dirt
her father_zossima a homeless sickly drunkard called ilya had lost everything and lived many years as a workman with some well to do tradespeople
her coarse almost black hair curled like lamb wool and formed a sort of huge cap on her head her mother had long been dead
but she rarely did so for every one in the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot and so specially dear to god
ilya employers and many others in the town especially of the tradespeople tried to clothe her better and always rigged her out with high boots and sheepskin coat for the winter
but although she allowed them to dress her up without resisting she usually went away preferably to the cathedral porch and taking off all that had been given her kerchief sheepskin skirt or boots she left them there and walked away barefoot in her smock as before
it happened on one occasion that a new governor of the province making a tour of inspection in our town saw lizaveta and was wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities
and though he was told she was an idiot he pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to wander about in nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties and must not occur again
spiteful and diseased ilya used to beat lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned to him but the governor went his way and lizaveta was left as she was
at last her father_zossima died which made her even more acceptable in the eye of the religious person of the town as an orphan
in fact every one seemed to like her even the boys did not tease her and the boys of our town especially the schoolboys are a mischievous set
she would walk into strange houses and no one drove her away every one was kind to her and gave her something
if she were given a copper she would take it and at once drop it in the alms jug of the church_of_christ or prison
if she were given a roll or bun in the market she would hand it to the first child she met
sometimes she would stop one of the richest lady in the town and give it to her and the lady would be pleased to take it
if she went into an expensive shop where there were costly goods or money lying about no one kept watch on her for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles overlooked by them she would not have touched a farthing
she slept either in the church_of_christ porch or climbed over a hurdle there are many hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town into a kitchen garden
she used at least once a week to turn up at home that is at the house of her father_zossima former employers and in the winter went there every night and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse
people were amazed that she could stand such a life but she was accustomed to it and although she was so tiny she was of a robust constitution
she herself never tasted anything but black bread and water she scarcely ever went to church_of_christ some of the townspeople declared that she did all this only from pride but that is hardly credible
she could hardly speak and only from time to time uttered an inarticulate grunt how could she have been proud it happened one clear warm moonlight night in september many years ago
five or six drunken revelers were returning from the club at a very late hour according to our provincial notions they passed through the back way which led between the back garden of the houses with hurdles on either side
this way leads out on to the bridge over the long stinking pool which we were accustomed to call a river
among the nettles and burdocks under the hurdle our revelers saw lizaveta asleep they stopped to look at her laughing and began jesting with unbridled licentiousness
it occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical inquiry whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as a woman and so forth
but fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who was among them sprang forward and declared that it was by no means impossible and that indeed there was a certain piquancy about it and so on
they all pronounced with lofty repugnance that it was impossible it is true that at that time he was overdoing his part as a buffoon
he liked to put himself forward and entertain the company ostensibly on equal terms of course though in reality he was on a servile footing with them
it was just at the time when he had received the news of his first wife death in petersburg and with crape upon his hat was drinking and behaving so shamelessly that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of him
the revelers of course laughed at this unexpected opinion and one of them even began challenging him to act upon it
the others repelled the idea even more emphatically although still with the utmost hilarity and at last they went on their way
later on fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov swore that he had gone with them and perhaps it was so no one knows for certain and no one ever knew
but five or six months later all the town was talking with intense and sincere indignation of lizaveta condition and trying to find out who was the miscreant who had wronged her
then suddenly a terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no other than fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who set the rumor going
of that drunken band five had left the town and the only one still among us was an elderly and much respected civil councilor the father_zossima of grown up daughters who could hardly have spread the tale even if there had been any foundation for it
but rumor pointed straight at fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and persisted in pointing at him of course this was no great grievance to him he would not have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople
in those day he was proud and did not condescend to talk except in his own circle of the officials and nobles whom he entertained so well
at the time grigory_vassilyevitch stood up for his master vigorously he provoked quarrels and altercations in defense of him and succeeded in bringing some people round to his side
it the wench own fault he asserted and the culprit was karp a dangerous convict who had escaped from prison and whose name was well known to us as he had hidden in our town
this conjecture sounded plausible for it was remembered that karp had been in the neighborhood just at that time in the autumn and had robbed three people
but this affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular sympathy from the poor idiot she was better looked after than ever
a well to do merchant widow named kondratyev arranged to take her into her house at the end of april meaning not to let her go out until after the confinement
they kept a constant watch over her but in spite of their vigilance she escaped on the very last day and made her way into fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov garden
how in her condition she managed to climb over the high strong fence remained a mystery some maintained that she must have been lifted over by somebody others hinted at something more uncanny
the most likely explanation is that it happened naturally that lizaveta accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in garden had somehow managed to climb this fence in spite of her condition and had leapt down injuring herself
grigory_vassilyevitch rushed to marfa and sent her to lizaveta while he ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by
they saved the baby but lizaveta died at dawn grigory_vassilyevitch took the baby brought it home and making his wife sit down put it on her lap
a child of god an orphan is akin to all he said and to us above others our little lost one has sent us this who has come from the devil son and a holy innocent
nurse him and weep no more so marfa brought up the child he was christened pavel to which people were not slow in adding ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov son of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov did not object to any of this and thought it amusing though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility
the townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling later on fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov invented a surname for the child calling him smerdyakov after his mother nickname
so this smerdyakov became fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov second servant and was living in the lodge with grigory_vassilyevitch and marfa at the time our story begins
i ought to say something of this smerdyakov but i am ashamed of keeping my readers attention so long occupied with these common menials and i will go back to my story hoping to say more of smerdyakov in the course of it
he was employed as cook chapter iii the confession of a passionate heart in verse alyosha_karamazov remained for some time irresolute after hearing the command his father_zossima shouted to him from the carriage
but in spite of his uneasiness he did not stand still that was not his way he went at once to the kitchen to find out what his father_zossima had been doing above
i hasten to add that his father_zossima shouts commanding him to return home with his mattress and pillow did not frighten him in the least
then he set off trusting that on the way he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting him he understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely a flourish to produce an effect
in the same way a tradesman in our town who was celebrating his name day with a party of friends getting angry at being refused more vodka smashed up his own crockery and furniture and tore his own and his wife clothes and finally broke his windows all for the sake of effect
next day of course when he was sober he regretted the broken cups and saucers alyosha_karamazov knew that his father_zossima would let him go back to the monastery next day possibly even that evening
alyosha_karamazov was certain that no one in the whole world ever would want to hurt him and what is more he knew that no one could hurt him
this was for him an axiom assumed once for all without question and he went his way without hesitation relying on it
but at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him and worried him the more because he could not formulate it
it was the fear of a woman of katerina_ivanovna who had so urgently entreated him in the note handed to him by madame_hohlakov to come and see her about something
this request and the necessity of going had at once aroused an uneasy feeling in his heart and this feeling had grown more and more painful all the morning in spite of the scenes at the hermitage and at the father_zossima superior
moreover he was fully persuaded that his father_zossima might hurt any one else but would not hurt him he was not uneasy because he did not know what she would speak of and what he must answer
though he knew little of women he had spent his life from early childhood till he entered the monastery entirely with women
and he was not afraid of her simply as a woman he was afraid of that woman katerina_ivanovna he had been afraid of her from the first time he saw her
he had only seen her two or three time and had only chanced to say a few words to her he thought of her as a beautiful proud imperious girl
it was not her beauty which troubled him but something else and the vagueness of his apprehension increased the apprehension itself
the girl aims were of the noblest he knew that she was trying to save his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov simply through generosity though he had already behaved badly to her
yet although alyosha_karamazov recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments a shiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her house
he reflected that he would not find ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov who was so intimate a friend with her for ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was certainly now with his father_zossima
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov he was even more certain not to find there and he had a foreboding of the reason and so his conversation would be with her alone
he had a great longing to run and see his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov before that fateful interview without showing him the letter he could talk to him about it
but dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov lived a long way off and he was sure to be away from home too standing still for a minute he reached a final decision
crossing himself with a rapid and accustomed gesture and at once smiling he turned resolutely in the direction of his terrible lady
he knew her house if he went by the high street and then across the market place it was a long way round
though our town is small it is scattered and the houses are far apart and meanwhile his father_zossima was expecting him and perhaps had not yet forgotten his command
he might be unreasonable and so he had to make haste to get there and back so he decided to take a short cut by the back way for he knew every inch of the ground
this meant skirting fences climbing over hurdles and crossing other people back yards where every one he met knew him and greeted him
in this way he could reach the high street in half the time he had to pass the garden adjoining his father_zossima and belonging to a little tumbledown house with four windows
the owner of this house as alyosha_karamazov knew was a bedridden old woman living with her daughter who had been a genteel maid servant in generals families in petersburg
now she had been at home a year looking after her sick mother she always dressed up in fine clothes though her old mother
and she had sunk into such poverty that they went every day to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov kitchen for soup and bread which marfa gave readily
yet though the young woman came up for soup she had never sold any of her dresses and one of these even had a long train a fact which alyosha_karamazov had learned from mr_rakitin who always knew everything that was going on in the town
he had forgotten it as soon as he heard it but now on reaching the garden he remembered the dress with the train raised his head which had been bowed in thought and came upon something quite unexpected
over the hurdle in the garden dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov mounted on something was leaning forward gesticulating violently beckoning to him obviously afraid to utter a word for fear of being overheard
alyosha_karamazov ran up to the hurdle it a good thing you looked up i was nearly shouting to you mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov said in a joyful hurried whisper
climb in here quickly how splendid that you ve come i was just thinking of you alyosha_karamazov was delighted too but he did not know how to get over the hurdle
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov put his powerful hand under his elbow to help him jump tucking up his cassock alyosha_karamazov leapt over the hurdle with the agility of a bare legged street urchin
well done now come along said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in an enthusiastic whisper where whispered alyosha_karamazov looking about him and finding himself in a deserted garden with no one near but themselves
the garden was small but the house was at least fifty paces away there no one here why do you whisper
asked alyosha_karamazov why do i whisper deuce take it cried dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov at the top of his voice
you see what silly tricks nature plays one i am here in secret and on the watch i ll explain later on but knowing it a secret i began whispering like a fool when there no need
let us go over there till then be quiet i want to kiss you glory to god in the world glory to god in me
i was just repeating that sitting here before you came the garden was about three acres in extent and planted with trees only along the fence at the four sides
the middle of the garden was an empty grass space from which several hundredweight of hay was carried in the summer
there were also plantations of raspberries and currants and gooseberries laid out along the sides a kitchen garden had been planted lately near the house
there were apple trees maples limes and birch trees the garden was let out for a few roubles for the summer dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov led his brother to the most secluded corner of the garden
there in a thicket of lime trees and old bushes of black currant elder snowball tree and lilac there stood a tumble down green summer house blackened with age
its walls were of lattice work but there was still a roof which could give shelter god knows when this summer house was built
there was a tradition that it had been put up some fifty years before by a retired colonel called von schmidt who owned the house at that time
in the summer house there was a green wooden table fixed in the ground and round it were some green benches upon which it was still possible to sit
alyosha_karamazov had at once observed his brother exhilarated condition and on entering the arbor he saw half a bottle of brandy and a wineglass on the table
it was all in decay the floor was rotting the planks were loose the woodwork smelled musty that brandy mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov laughed
i see your look he drinking again distrust the apparition distrust the worthless lying crowd and lay aside thy doubts
i not drinking i only indulging as that pig your mr_rakitin says he ll be a civil councilor one day but he ll always talk about indulging
i could take you in my arms alyosha_karamazov and press you to my bosom till i crush you for in the whole world in reality in re al
sit down i ty can you take it in i love no one but you he uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation
no one but you and one jade i have fallen in love with to my ruin but being in love doesnt mean loving
you may be in love with a woman and yet hate her remember that i can talk about it gayly still
sit down here by the table and i ll sit beside you and look at you and go on talking you shall keep quiet and i ll go on talking for the time has come
but on reflection you know i better speak quietly for here here you can never tell what ears are listening i will explain everything as they say the story will be continued
why have i been longing for you why have i been thirsting for you all these day and just now it five day since i ve cast anchor here
because i must because i need you because to morrow i shall fly from the clouds because to morrow life is ending and beginning
because it only to you i can tell everything have you ever felt have you ever dreamt of falling down a precipice into a pit
that just how i falling but not in a dream and i not afraid and dont you be afraid at least i am afraid but i enjoy it
it not enjoyment though but ecstasy damn it all whatever it is a strong spirit a weak spirit a womanish spirit whatever it is
let us praise nature you see what sunshine how clear the sky is the leaves are all green it still summer four clock in the afternoon and the stillness
where were you going i was going to father_zossima but i meant to go to katerina_ivanovna first to her and to father_zossima
oo what a coincidence why was i waiting for you hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in my ribs
why to send you to father_zossima and to her katerina_ivanovna so as to have done with her and with father_zossima
to send an angel i might have sent any one but i wanted to send an angel and here you are on your way to see father_zossima and her
did you really mean to send me cried alyosha_karamazov with a distressed expression stay you knew it and i see you understand it all at once
but be quiet be quiet for a time dont be sorry and dont cry dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov stood up thought a moment and put his finger to his forehead
she asked you written to you a letter or something that why you re going to her you wouldnt be going except for that
here is her note alyosha_karamazov took it out of his pocket mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looked through it quickly and you were going the back way
oh gods i thank you for sending him by the back way and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable
listen alyosha_karamazov listen brother now i mean to tell you everything for i must tell some one an angel in heaven i ve told already but i want to tell an angel on earth
you are an angel on earth you will hear and judge and forgive and that what i need that some one above me should forgive
if two people break away from everything on earth and fly off into the unknown or at least one of them and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and says do this for me some favor never asked before that could only be asked on one deathbed would that other refuse if he were a friend or a brother
listen i will do it but tell me what it is and make haste said alyosha_karamazov make haste m dont be in a hurry alyosha_karamazov you hurry and worry yourself
there no need to hurry now now the world has taken a new turning ah alyosha_karamazov what a pity you cant understand ecstasy
but what am i saying to him as though you didnt understand it what an ass i am what am i saying
be noble man who says that alyosha_karamazov made up his mind to wait he felt that perhaps indeed his work lay here
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sank into thought for a moment with his elbow on the table and his head in his hand both were silent
alyosha_karamazov said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov you re the only one who wont laugh i should like to begin my confession with schiller hymn to joy an die freude
i dont know german i only know it called that dont think i talking nonsense because i drunk i not a bit drunk
brandy all very well but i need two bottles to make me drunk silenus with his rosy phiz upon his stumbling ass
but i ve not drunk a quarter of a bottle and i not silenus i not silenus though i am strong for i ve made a decision once for all
forgive me the pun you ll have to forgive me a lot more than puns to day dont be uneasy i not spinning it out
i talking sense and i ll come to the point in a minute i wont keep you in suspense stay how does it go
he raised his head thought a minute and began with enthusiasm wild and fearful in his cavern hid the naked troglodyte and the homeless nomad wandered laying waste the fertile plain
menacing with spear and arrow in the wood the hunter strayed woe to all poor wretches stranded on those cruel and hostile shores
from the peak of high olympus came the mother ceres down seeking in those savage regions her lost daughter proserpine
but the goddess found no refuge found no kindly welcome there and no temple bearing witness to the worship of the gods
from the fields and from the vineyards came no fruits to deck the feasts only flesh of bloodstained victims smoldered on the altar fires and where er the grieving goddess turns her melancholy gaze sunk in vilest degradation
man his loathsomeness displays mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov broke into sobs and seized alyosha_karamazov hand my dear my dear in degradation in degradation now too
there a terrible amount of suffering for man on earth a terrible lot of trouble dont think i only a brute in an officer uniform wallowing in dirt and drink
i hardly think of anything but of that degraded man if only i not lying i pray god i not lying and showing off
would he purge his soul from vileness and attain to light and worth he must turn and cling for ever to his ancient mother earth
i think about that man because i am that man myself but the difficulty is how am i to cling for ever to mother earth
i dont kiss her i dont cleave to her bosom am i to become a peasant or a shepherd i go on
and i dont know whether i going to shame or to light and joy that the trouble for everything in the world is a riddle
and whenever i ve happened to sink into the vilest degradation and it always been happening i always read that poem about ceres and man
for when i do leap into the pit i go headlong with my heels up and am pleased to be falling in that degrading attitude and pride myself upon it
has it reformed me never for i a alyosha_karamazov and in the very depths of that degradation i begin a hymn of praise
let me be vile and base only let me kiss the hem of the veil in which my god is shrouded
though i may be following the devil i am thy son lord and i love thee and i feel the joy without which the world cannot stand
let me be accursed joy everlasting fostereth the soul of all creation it is her secret ferment fires the cup of life with flame
the grass hath turned each blade towards the light and solar systems have evolved from chaos and dark night filling the realms of boundless space beyond the sage sight
at bounteous nature kindly breast all things that breathe drink joy and birds and beasts and creeping things all follow where she leads
tis at her beck her gifts to man are friends in need the wreath the foaming must to angels vision of god throne to insects sensual lust
but enough poetry i am in tears let me cry it may be foolishness that every one would laugh at but you wont laugh
your eye are shining too enough poetry i want to tell you now about the insects to whom god gave sensual lust
all we karamazovs are such insects and angel as you are that insect lives in you too and will stir up a tempest in your blood
to insects sensual lust i am that insect brother and it is said of me specially tempests because sensual lust is a tempest worse than a tempest
it is terrible because it has not been fathomed and never can be fathomed for god sets us nothing but riddles
beauty is a terrible and awful thing here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side by side i am not a cultivated man brother but i ve thought a lot about this
it terrible what mysteries there are too many riddles weigh man down on earth we must solve them as we can and try to keep a dry skin in the water
i cant endure the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the madonna and ends with the ideal of sodom
what still more awful is that a man with the ideal of sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal of the madonna and his heart may be on fire with that ideal genuinely on fire just as in his day of youth and innocence
beauty yes man is broad too broad indeed i have him narrower the devil only knows what to make of it
what to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart is there beauty in sodom believe me that for the immense mass of mankind beauty is found in sodom
did you know that secret the awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible god and the devil are fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man
but a man always talks of his own ache listen now to come to facts chapter iv the confession of a passionate heart
in anecdote i was leading a wild life then father_zossima said just now that i spent several thousand roubles in seducing young girls
that a swinish invention and there was nothing of the sort and if there was i didnt need money simply for that
with me money is an accessory the overflow of my heart the framework to day she would be my lady to morrow a wench out of the streets in her place
sometimes i gave it to the lady too for they ll take it greedily that must be admitted and be pleased and thankful for it
i entertained them both i threw away money by the handful on music rioting and gypsies lady used to be fond of me not all of them but it happened it happened
but i always liked side paths little dark back alleys behind the main road there one finds adventures and surprises and precious metal in the dirt
i am speaking figuratively brother in the town i was in there were no such back alleys in the literal sense but morally there were
if you were like me you know what that means i loved vice i loved the ignominy of vice i loved cruelty am i not a bug am i not a noxious insect
in fact a alyosha_karamazov once we went a whole lot of us for a picnic in seven sledges it was dark it was winter and i began squeezing a girl hand and forced her to kiss me
she was the daughter of an official a sweet gentle submissive creature she allowed me she allowed me much in the dark
she thought poor thing that i should come next day to make her an offer i was looked upon as a good match too
but i didnt say a word to her for five months i used to see her in a corner at dances we were always having dances her eye watching me
i saw how they glowed with fire a fire of gentle indignation this game only tickled that insect lust i cherished in my soul
five months later she married an official and left the town still angry and still perhaps in love with me now they live happily
observe that i told no one i didnt boast of it though i full of low desires and love what low i not dishonorable
you re blushing your eye flashed enough of this filth with you and all this was nothing much wayside blossoms la paul de kock
though the cruel insect had already grown strong in my soul i ve a perfect album of reminiscences brother god bless them the darlings
i tried to break it off without quarreling and i never gave them away i never bragged of one of them
no i going to tell you something more curious and dont be surprised that i glad to tell you instead of being ashamed
but that enough you cant suppose i brought you here simply to talk of such nonsense you say that because i blushed alyosha_karamazov said suddenly
i wasnt blushing at what you were saying or at what you ve done i blushed because i am the same as you are
you come that going a little too far no it not too far said alyosha_karamazov warmly obviously the idea was not a new one
the ladder the same i at the bottom step and you re above somewhere about the thirteenth that how i see it
but it all the same absolutely the same in kind any one on the bottom step is bound to go up to the top one
then one ought not to step on at all any one who can help it had better not but can you
i think not hush alyosha_karamazov hush darling i could kiss your hand you touch me so that rogue grushenka has an eye for man
from this field of corruption fouled by flies let pass to my tragedy also befouled by flies that is by every sort of vileness
although the old man told lies about my seducing innocence there really was something of the sort in my tragedy though it was only once and then it did not come off
the old man who has reproached me with what never happened does not even know of this fact i never told any one about it
she told me once that she devour you one day there there i wont you re the first except ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov of course ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knows everything
he knew about it long before you but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov a tomb ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov a tomb yes alyosha_karamazov listened with great attention
i was lieutenant in a line regiment but still i was under supervision like a kind of convict yet i was awfully well received in the little town
i spent money right and left i was thought to be rich i thought so myself but i must have pleased them in other ways as well
although they shook their heads over me they liked me my colonel who was an old man took a sudden dislike to me
he was always down upon me but i had powerful friends and moreover all the town was on my side so he couldnt do me much harm
i was in fault myself for refusing to treat him with proper respect i was proud this obstinate old fellow who was really a very good sort kind hearted and hospitable had had two wives both dead
she was a young woman of four and twenty when i was there and was living with her father_zossima and an aunt her mother sister
his first wife who was of a humble family left a daughter as unpretentious as herself the aunt was simple and illiterate the niece was simple but lively
i like to say nice things about people i never knew a woman of more charming character than agafya_ivanovna fancy her name was agafya_ivanovna
and she wasnt bad looking either in the russian style tall stout with a full figure and beautiful eye though a rather coarse face
she had not married although she had had two suitors she refused them but was as cheerful as ever i was intimate with her not in that way it was pure friendship
i have often been friendly with women quite innocently i used to talk to her with shocking frankness and she only laughed
many women like such freedom and she was a girl too which made it very amusing another thing one could never think of her as a young lady
she and her aunt lived in her father_zossima house with a sort of voluntary humility not putting themselves on an equality with other people
she was a general favorite and of use to every one for she was a clever dressmaker she had a talent for it
she gave her services freely without asking for payment but if any one offered her payment she didnt refuse the colonel of course was a very different matter
he was one of the chief personages in the district he kept open house entertained the whole town gave suppers and dances
at the time i arrived and joined the battalion all the town was talking of the expected return of the colonel second daughter a great beauty who had just left a fashionable school in the capital
this second daughter is katerina_ivanovna and she was the child of the second wife who belonged to a distinguished general family although as i learnt on good authority she too brought the colonel no money
she had connections and that was all there may have been expectations but they had come to nothing yet when the young lady came from boarding school on a visit the whole town revived
our most distinguished lady two excellencies and a colonel wife and all the rest following their lead at once took her up and gave entertainments in her honor
i took no notice i went on as wildly as before and one of my exploits at the time set all the town talking
i saw her eye taking my measure one evening at the battery commander but i didnt go up to her as though i disdained her acquaintance
she was the belle of the balls and picnics and they got up tableaux vivants in aid of distressed governesses i did go up and speak to her at an evening party not long after
she scarcely looked at me and compressed her lips scornfully wait a bit i ll have my revenge thought i i behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time and i was conscious of it myself
what made it worse was that i felt that katenka was not an innocent boarding school miss but a person of character proud and really high principled above all she had education and intellect and i had neither
you think i meant to make her an offer no i simply wanted to revenge myself because i was such a hero
and she didnt seem to feel it meanwhile i spent my time in drink and riot till the lieutenant colonel put me under arrest for three day
just at that time father_zossima sent me six thousand roubles in return for my sending him a deed giving up all claims upon him settling our accounts so to speak and saying that i wouldnt expect anything more
until i came here alyosha_karamazov till the last few day indeed perhaps even now i havent been able to make head or tail of my money affairs with father_zossima
i didnt understand a word of it at the time but never mind that we ll talk of it later just as i received the money i got a letter from a friend telling me something that interested me immensely
the authorities i learnt were dissatisfied with our lieutenant colonel he was suspected of irregularities in fact his enemies were preparing a surprise for him
and then the commander of the division arrived and kicked up the devil of a shindy shortly afterwards he was ordered to retire
i wont tell you how it all happened he had enemies certainly suddenly there was a marked coolness in the town towards him and all his family
i met agafya_ivanovna with whom i always kept up a friendship and said do you know there a deficit of roubles of government money in your father_zossima accounts
his friends all turned their backs on him then i took my first step what do you mean what makes you say so
the general was here not long ago and everything was all right then it was but now it isnt
she was terribly scared dont frighten me she said who told you so dont be uneasy i said i wont tell any one
i only wanted in view of possibilities to add that when they demand that roubles from your father_zossima and he cant produce it he ll be tried and made to serve as a common soldier in his old age unless you like to send me your young lady secretly
you know i as silent as the tomb i ve just had money paid me i ll give her four thousand if you like and keep the secret religiously
ah you scoundrel that what she said you wicked scoundrel how dare you she went away furiously indignant while i shouted after her once more that the secret should be kept sacred
those two simple creatures agafya_ivanovna and her aunt i may as well say at once behaved like perfect angels all through this business
they genuinely adored their katya thought her far above them and waited on her hand and foot but agafya_ivanovna told her of our conversation
i found that out afterwards she didnt keep it back and of course that was all i wanted suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion
the old lieutenant colonel was taken ill at once couldnt leave his room for two day and didnt hand over the government money
but i knew for a fact and had known for a long time that for the last four years the money had never been in his hands except when the commander made his visits of inspection
he used to lend it to a trustworthy person a merchant of our town called trifonov an old widower with a big beard and gold rimmed spectacles
he used to go to the fair do a profitable business with the money and return the whole sum to the colonel bringing with it a present from the fair as well as interest on the loan
but this time i heard all about it quite by chance from trifonov son and heir a driveling youth and one of the most vicious in the world this time i say trifonov brought nothing back from the fair
dr kravchenko declared that he really was ill the lieutenant colonel flew to him i ve never received any money from you and couldnt possibly have received any
so now our lieutenant colonel is confined to the house with a towel round his head while they re all three busy putting ice on it
all at once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order to hand over the battalion money immediately within two hours
he signed the book i saw the signature in the book afterwards stood up saying he would put on his uniform ran to his bedroom loaded his double barreled gun with a service bullet took the boot off his right foot fixed the gun against his chest and began feeling for the trigger with his foot
that was all the answer he got but agafya_ivanovna remembering what i had told her had her suspicions she stole up and peeped into the room just in time
she rushed in flung herself upon him from behind threw her arms round him and the gun went off hit the ceiling but hurt no one
the others ran in took away the gun and held him by the arms i heard all about this afterwards i was at home it was getting dusk and i was just preparing to go out
i had dressed brushed my hair scented my handkerchief and taken up my cap when suddenly the door opened and facing me in the room stood katerina_ivanovna
it strange how things happen sometimes no one had seen her in the street so that no one knew of it in the town
they were most obliging old things ready to do anything for me and at my request were as silent afterwards as two cast iron posts
she walked in and looked straight at me her dark eye determined even defiant but on her lips and round her mouth i saw uncertainty
i lodged with two decrepit old lady who looked after me of course i grasped the position at once my sister told me she began that you would give me roubles if i came to you for it myself
i have come give me the money she couldnt keep it up she was breathless frightened her voice failed her and the corners of her mouth and the lines round it quivered
alyosha_karamazov are you listening or are you asleep mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i know you will tell the whole truth said alyosha_karamazov in agitation
i am telling it if i tell the whole truth just as it happened i shant spare myself my first idea was a alyosha_karamazov one
once i was bitten by a centipede brother and laid up a fortnight with fever from it well i felt a centipede biting at my heart then a noxious insect you understand
i looked her up and down you ve seen her she a beauty but she was beautiful in another way then at that moment she was beautiful because she was noble and i was a scoundrel
she in all the grandeur of her generosity and sacrifice for her father_zossima and i a bug and scoundrel as i was she was altogether at my mercy body and soul
she was hemmed in i tell you frankly that thought that venomous thought so possessed my heart that it almost swooned with suspense
it seemed as if there could be no resisting it as though i should act like a bug like a venomous spider without a spark of pity
understand i should have gone next day to ask for her hand so that it might end honorably so to speak and that nobody would or could know
and at that very second some voice seemed to whisper in my ear but when you come to morrow to make your proposal that girl wont even see you she ll order her coachman to kick you out of the yard
i could scarcely breathe for though i a man of base desires i honest publish it through all the town she would say i not afraid of you
i looked at the young lady my voice had not deceived me that is how it would be not a doubt of it
i longed to play her the nastiest swinish cad trick to look at her with a sneer and on the spot where she stood before me to stun her with a tone of voice that only a shopman could use
i could see from her face now that i should be turned out of the house my spite was roused four thousand
what do you mean i was joking you ve been counting your chickens too easily madam two hundred if you like with all my heart
but four thousand is not a sum to throw away on such frivolity you ve put yourself out to no purpose
i should have lost the game of course she have run away but it would have been an infernal revenge it would have been worth it all
would you believe it it has never happened to me with any other woman not one to look at her at such a moment with hatred
but on my oath i looked at her for three second or five perhaps with fearful hatred that hate which is only a hair breadth from love from the maddest love
i went to the window put my forehead against the frozen pane and i remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire
i have howled with regret all the rest of my life only to have played that trick i did not keep her long dont be afraid
i turned round went up to the table opened the drawer and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles it was lying in a french dictionary
then i showed it her in silence folded it handed it to her opened the door into the passage and stepping back made her a deep bow a most respectful a most impressive bow believe me
she shuddered all over gazed at me for a second turned horribly pale white as a sheet in fact and all at once not impetuously but softly gently bowed down to my feet not a boarding school curtsey but a russian bow with her forehead to the floor
she jumped up and ran away i was wearing my sword i drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot why i dont know
it would have been frightfully stupid of course i suppose it was from delight can you understand that one might kill oneself from delight
i only kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard which there was no need to have told you by the way
but i didnt stab myself and i fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict i have laid it on rather thick to glorify myself
but let it pass and to hell with all who pry into the human heart well so much for that adventure with katerina_ivanovna
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov got up took a step or two in his excitement pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead then sat down again not in the same place as before but on the opposite side so that alyosha_karamazov had to turn quite round to face him
so now ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knows of it and you no one else chapter the confession of a passionate heart heels up now said alyosha_karamazov i understand the first half
you understand the first half that half is a drama and it was played out there the second half is a tragedy and it is being acted here
and i understand nothing of that second half so far said alyosha_karamazov and i do you suppose i understand it
stop dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov there one important question tell me you were betrothed you are betrothed still we werent betrothed at once not for three months after that adventure
the next day i told myself that the incident was closed concluded that there would be no sequel it seemed to me caddish to make her an offer
on her side she gave no sign of life for the six weeks that she remained in the town except indeed for one action
the day after her visit the maid servant slipped round with an envelope addressed to me i tore it open it contained the change out of the banknote
only four thousand five hundred roubles was needed but there was a discount of about two hundred on changing it she only sent me about two hundred and sixty
i dont remember exactly but not a note not a word of explanation i searched the packet for a pencil mark nothing
well i spent the rest of the money on such an orgy that the new major was obliged to reprimand me
well the lieutenant colonel produced the battalion money to the astonishment of every one for nobody believed that he had the money untouched
he no sooner paid it than he fell ill took to his bed and three weeks later softening of the brain set in and he died five day afterwards
he was buried with military honors for he had not had time to receive his discharge ten day after his funeral katerina_ivanovna with her aunt and sister went to moscow
i received a tiny note a sheet of thin blue paper and on it only one line in pencil i will write to you
and behold on the very day they went away i hadnt seen them didnt see them off or take leave wait
k and that was all i ll explain the rest now in two words in moscow their fortunes changed with the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness of an arabian fairy tale
that general widow their nearest relation suddenly lost the two nieces who were her heiresses and next of kin both died in the same week of small pox
the old lady prostrated with grief welcomed katya as a daughter as her one hope clutched at her altered her will in katya favor
but that concerned the future meanwhile she gave her for present use eighty thousand roubles as a marriage portion to do what she liked with
she was an hysterical woman i saw something of her in moscow later well suddenly i received by post four thousand five hundred roubles
i was speechless with surprise as you may suppose three day later came the promised letter i have it with me now
you must read it she offers to be my wife offers herself to me i love you madly she says even if you dont love me never mind
be my husband dont be afraid i wont hamper you in any way i will be your chattel i will be the carpet under your feet
alyosha_karamazov i am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in my vulgar tone my everlastingly vulgar tone that i can never cure myself of
i want to love you for ever i want to save you from yourself that letter stabs me even now do you think i dont mind that i dont mind still
i wrote her an answer at once as it was impossible for me to go to moscow i wrote to her with tears
one thing i shall be ashamed of for ever i referred to her being rich and having a dowry while i was only a stuck up beggar
then i wrote at once to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and told him all i could about it in a letter of six pages and sent him to her
i mentioned money i ought to have borne it in silence but it slipped from my pen why do you look like that
why are you staring at me yes ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov fell in love with her he in love with her still i know that
i did a stupid thing in the world opinion but perhaps that one stupid thing may be the saving of us all now
when she compares us do you suppose she can love a man like me especially after all that has happened here
oo dont you see what a lot she thinks of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how she respects him but i am convinced that she does love a man like you and not a man like him
she loves her own virtue not me the words broke involuntarily and almost malignantly from dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov he laughed but a minute later his eye gleamed he flushed crimson and struck the table violently with his fist
i swear alyosha_karamazov he cried with intense and genuine anger at himself you may not believe me but as god is holy and as church_of_christ is god i swear that though i smiled at her lofty sentiments just now i know that i am a million time baser in soul than she and that these lofty sentiments of her are as sincere as a heavenly angel
that the tragedy of it that i know that for certain what if any one does show off a bit dont i do it myself
and yet i sincere i sincere as for ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i can understand how he must be cursing nature now with his intellect too
to a monster who though he is betrothed and all eye are fixed on him cant restrain his debauchery and before the very eye of his betrothed
to see the preference given to whom to what and a man like me is preferred while he is rejected and why
i ve never said a word of this to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov of course has never dropped a hint of the sort to me
but destiny will be accomplished and the best man will hold his ground while the undeserving one will vanish into his back alley for ever his filthy back alley his beloved back alley where he is at home and where he will sink in filth and stench at his own free will and with enjoyment
because a girl wants to sacrifice her life and destiny out of gratitude it ridiculous i ve been talking foolishly i ve no words left
i use them at random but it will be as i have said i shall drown in the back alley and she will marry ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
stop dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov interrupted again with great anxiety there one thing you havent made clear yet you are still betrothed all the same arent you
how can you break off the engagement if she your betrothed doesnt want to yes formally and solemnly betrothed it was all done on my arrival in moscow with great ceremony with ikons all in fine style
the general wife blessed us and would you believe it congratulated katya you ve made a good choice she said i see right through him
and would you believe it she didnt like ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and hardly greeted him i had a lot of talk with katya in moscow
i told her about myself sincerely honorably she listened to everything there was sweet confusion there were tender words though there were proud words too
why i called to you and brought you out here to day this very day remember it to send you this very day again to katerina_ivanovna and
she wrung out of me a mighty promise to reform i gave my promise and here what what
to tell her that i shall never come to see her again say he sends you his compliments but is that possible
that just the reason i sending you in my place because it impossible and how could i tell her myself
and where are you going to the back alley to grushenka then alyosha_karamazov exclaimed mournfully clasping his hands can mr_rakitin really have told the truth
i thought that you had just visited her and that was all can a betrothed man pay such visits is such a thing possible and with such a betrothed and before the eye of all the world
confound it i have some honor as soon as i began visiting grushenka i ceased to be betrothed and to be an honest man
i had heard and i know for a fact now that that captain father_zossima agent had given grushenka an i u of mine for her to sue me for payment so as to put an end to me
i understand that why do you look at me you see i went in the first place to beat her they wanted to scare me
i went to beat her i had had a glimpse of her before she doesnt strike one at first sight i knew about her old merchant who lying ill now paralyzed but he leaving her a decent little sum
i knew too that she was fond of money that she hoarded it and lent it at a wicked rate of interest that she a merciless cheat and swindler
i went to beat her and i stayed the storm broke it struck me down like the plague i plague stricken still and i know that everything is over that there will never be anything more for me
the cycle of the ages is accomplished that my position and though i a beggar as fate would have it i had three thousand just then in my pocket
i got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants there drunk on it and all the women and girls
i drove with grushenka to mokroe a place twenty five versts from here i sent the thousands flying in three day time i was stripped bare but a hero
do you suppose the hero had gained his end not a sign of it from her i tell you that rogue grushenka has a supple curve all over her body
you can see it in her little foot even in her little toe i saw it and kissed it but that was all i swear
i ll marry you if you like she said you re a beggar you know say that you wont beat me and will let me do anything i choose and perhaps i will marry you
she laughed and she laughing still dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov leapt up with a sort of fury he seemed all at once as though he were drunk
his eye became suddenly bloodshot and do you really mean to marry her at once if she will and if she wont i shall stay all the same
i ll be the porter at her gate alyosha_karamazov he cried he stopped short before him and taking him by the shoulders began shaking him violently
let me tell you alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov that i may be a low man with low and degraded passions but a thief and a pickpocket dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov never can be
do you know you innocent boy that this is all delirium senseless delirium for there a tragedy here well then let me tell you that i am a thief and a pickpocket
that very morning just before i went to beat grushenka katerina_ivanovna sent for me and in strict secrecy why i dont know
i suppose she had some reason asked me to go to the chief town of the province and to post three thousand roubles to agafya_ivanovna in moscow so that nothing should be known of it in the town here
so i had that three thousand roubles in my pocket when i went to see grushenka and it was that money we spent at mokroe
afterwards i pretended i had been to the town but did not show her the post office receipt i said i had sent the money and would bring the receipt and so far i havent brought it
i ve forgotten it now what do you think you re going to her to day to say he sends his compliments and she ll ask you what about the money
you might still have said to her he a degraded sensualist and a low creature with uncontrolled passions he didnt send your money then but wasted it because like a low brute he couldnt control himself
but still you might have added he isnt a thief though here is your three thousand he sends it back send it yourself to agafya_ivanovna
but he told me to say he sends his compliments but as it is she will ask but where is the money
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov you are unhappy yes but not as unhappy as you think dont worry yourself to death with despair what do you suppose i shoot myself because i cant get three thousand to pay back
that just it i shant shoot myself i havent the strength now afterwards perhaps but now i going to grushenka i dont care what happens
and what then i ll be her husband if she deigns to have me and when lovers come i ll go into the next room
i ll clean her friends goloshes blow up their samovar run their errands katerina_ivanovna will understand it all alyosha_karamazov said solemnly
she ll understand how great this trouble is and will forgive she has a lofty mind and no one could be more unhappy than you
she ll see that for herself she wont forgive everything said dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a grin there something in it brother that no woman could forgive
do you know what would be the best thing to do what pay back the three thousand where can we get it from
i say i have two thousand ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov will give you another thousand that makes three take it and pay it back
you re not of age besides and you must you absolutely must take my farewell to her to day with the money or without it for i cant drag on any longer things have come to such a pass
and when would you get it your three thousand to morrow is too late i shall send you to father_zossima to father_zossima
yes to father_zossima first ask him for three thousand but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he wont give it as though he would
i know he wont do you know the meaning of despair alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov yes listen legally he owes me nothing i ve had it all from him i know that
but morally he owes me something doesnt he you know he started with twenty eight thousand of my mother money and made a hundred thousand with it
let him give me back only three out of the twenty eight thousand and he ll draw my soul out of hell and it will atone for many of his sins
for that three thousand i give you my solemn word i ll make an end of everything and he shall hear nothing more of me
for the last time i give him the chance to be a father_zossima tell him god himself sends him this chance
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he wont give it for anything i know he wont i know it perfectly well now especially that not all
now only a few day ago perhaps only yesterday he found out for the first time in earnest underline in earnest that grushenka is really perhaps not joking and really means to marry me
and do you suppose he going to give me money to help to bring that about when he crazy about her himself
i know something more he knows her nature he knows the cat and that not all either i can tell you more than that
i know that for the last five day he has had three thousand drawn out of the bank changed into notes of a hundred roubles packed into a large envelope sealed with five seals and tied across with red tape
you see how well i know all about it on the envelope is written to my angel grushenka when she will come to me
he scrawled it himself in silence and in secret and no one knows that the money there except the valet smerdyakov whom he trusts like himself
so now he has been expecting grushenka for the last three or four day he hopes she ll come for the money
he has sent her word of it and she has sent him word that perhaps she ll come and if she does go to the old man can i marry her after that
you understand now why i here in secret and what i on the watch for for her yes for her
foma has a room in the house of these sluts here foma comes from our parts he was a soldier in our regiment
he does jobs for them he watchman at night and goes grouse shooting in the day time and that how he lives i ve established myself in his room
neither he nor the women of the house know the secret that is that i am on the watch here no one but smerdyakov knows then
no one else he will let me know if she goes to the old man it was he told you about the money then
yes it a dead secret even ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov doesnt know about the money or anything the old man is sending ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to tchermashnya on a two or three day journey
a purchaser has turned up for the copse he ll give eight thousand for the timber so the old man keeps asking ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to help him by going to arrange it
it will take him two or three day that what the old man wants so that grushenka can come while he away
then he expecting grushenka to day no she wont come to day there are signs she certain not to come cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly
smerdyakov thinks so too father_zossima drinking now he sitting at table with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov go to him alyosha_karamazov and ask for the three thousand
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov dear what the matter with you cried alyosha_karamazov jumping up from his place and looking keenly at his brother frenzied face
for one moment the thought struck him that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was mad what is it i not insane said dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov looking intently and earnestly at him
no fear i am sending you to father_zossima and i know what i saying i believe in miracles in miracles
in a miracle of divine providence god knows my heart he sees my despair he sees the whole picture surely he wont let something awful happen
alyosha_karamazov i believe in miracles go i am going tell me will you wait for me here yes i know it will take some time
only remember you must go to katerina_ivanovna to day if it has to be at midnight with the money or without the money and say he sends his compliments to you
you cant go at him point blank he drunk now i ll wait three hours four five six seven i want you to say that verse to her he sends his compliments to you
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and what if grushenka comes to day if not to day to morrow or the next day grushenka i shall see her
i shall rush out and prevent it and if if there an if it will be murder i couldnt endure it
who will be murdered the old man i shant kill her brother what are you saying oh i dont know
i dont know perhaps i shant kill and perhaps i shall i afraid that he will suddenly become so loathsome to me with his face at that moment
i hate his ugly throat his nose his eye his shameless snigger i feel a physical repulsion that what i afraid of
that what may be too much for me i ll go mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i believe that god will order things for the best that nothing awful may happen
and i will sit and wait for the miracle and if it doesnt come to pass alyosha_karamazov went thoughtfully towards his father_zossima house
though there was a dining room in the house the table was laid as usual in the drawing room which was the largest room and furnished with old fashioned ostentation
chapter vi smerdyakov he did in fact find his father_zossima still at table the furniture was white and very old upholstered in old red silky material
on the walls covered with white paper which was torn in many places there hung two large portraits one of some prince who had been governor of the district thirty years before and the other of some bishop also long since dead
in the corner opposite the door there were several ikons before which a lamp was lighted at nightfall not so much for devotional purposes as to light the room
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov used to go to bed very late at three or four clock in the morning and would wander about the room at night or sit in an arm chair thinking
in the spaces between the windows there were mirrors in elaborate white and gilt frames of old fashioned carving this had become a habit with him
he often slept quite alone in the house sending his servants to the lodge but usually smerdyakov remained sleeping on a bench in the hall
when alyosha_karamazov came in dinner was over but coffee and preserves had been served fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov liked sweet things with brandy after dinner
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was also at table sipping coffee the servants grigory_vassilyevitch and smerdyakov were standing by both the gentlemen and the servants seemed in singularly good spirits
before he entered the room alyosha_karamazov heard the shrill laugh he knew so well and could tell from the sound of it that his father_zossima had only reached the good humored stage and was far from being completely drunk
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was roaring with laughter here he is here he is yelled fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov highly delighted at seeing alyosha_karamazov
join us sit down coffee is a lenten dish but it hot and good i dont offer you brandy you re keeping the fast
but would you like some no i better give you some of our famous liqueur smerdyakov go to the cupboard the second shelf on the right
here are the keys look sharp alyosha_karamazov began refusing the liqueur never mind if you wont have it we will said fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov beaming
yes answered alyosha_karamazov who had in truth only eaten a piece of bread and drunk a glass of kvas in the father_zossima superior kitchen
but stay have you dined though i should be pleased to have some hot coffee bravo my darling he ll have some coffee
does it want warming no it boiling it capital coffee smerdyakov making my smerdyakov an artist at coffee and at fish patties and at fish soup too
you must come one day and have some fish soup let me know beforehand but stay didnt i tell you this morning to come home with your mattress and pillow and all
have you brought your mattress he he he no i havent said alyosha_karamazov smiling too ah but you were frightened you were frightened this morning werent you
there my darling i couldnt do anything to vex you do you know ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i cant resist the way he looks one straight in the face and laughs
it makes me laugh all over i so fond of him alyosha_karamazov let me give you my blessing a father_zossima blessing
alyosha_karamazov rose but fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had already changed his mind no no he said i ll just make the sign of the cross over you for now
sit still now we ve a treat for you in your own line too it ll make you laugh balaam ass has begun talking to us here and how he talks
how he talks balaam ass it appeared was the valet smerdyakov he was a young man of about four and twenty remarkably unsociable and taciturn
not that he was shy or bashful on the contrary he was conceited and seemed to despise everybody but we must pause to say a few words about him now
he was brought up by grigory_vassilyevitch and marfa but the boy grew up with no sense of gratitude as grigory_vassilyevitch expressed it he was an unfriendly boy and seemed to look at the world mistrustfully
he used to dress up in a sheet as though it were a surplice and sang and waved some object over the dead cat as though it were a censer
in his childhood he was very fond of hanging cats and burying them with great ceremony all this he did on the sly with the greatest secrecy
grigory_vassilyevitch caught him once at this diversion and gave him a sound beating he shrank into a corner and sulked there for a week
he doesnt care for you or me the monster grigory_vassilyevitch used to say to marfa and he doesnt care for any one
are you a human being he said addressing the boy directly you re not a human being you grew from the mildew in the bath house
that what you are smerdyakov it appeared afterwards could never forgive him those words grigory_vassilyevitch taught him to read and write and when he was twelve years old began teaching him the scriptures
but this teaching came to nothing at the second or third lesson the boy suddenly grinned what that for asked grigory_vassilyevitch looking at him threateningly from under his spectacles
oh nothing god created light on the first day and the sun moon and stars on the fourth day where did the light come from on the first day
grigory_vassilyevitch was thunderstruck the boy looked sarcastically at his teacher there was something positively condescending in his expression grigory_vassilyevitch could not restrain himself
i ll show you where he cried and gave the boy a violent slap on the cheek the boy took the slap without a word but withdrew into his corner again for some day
a week later he had his first attack of the disease to which he was subject all the rest of his life epilepsy
till then he had taken no notice of him though he never scolded him and always gave him a copeck when he met him
when fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov heard of it his attitude to the boy seemed changed at once sometimes when he was in good humor he would send the boy something sweet from his table
but as soon as he heard of his illness he showed an active interest in him sent for a doctor and tried remedies but the disease turned out to be incurable
the fits occurred on an average once a month but at various interval the fits varied too in violence some were light and some were very severe
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov strictly forbade grigory_vassilyevitch to use corporal punishment to the boy and began allowing him to come upstairs to him
one day when the boy was about fifteen fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov noticed him lingering by the bookcase and reading the titles through the glass
he forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a time too fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had a fair number of book over a hundred but no one ever saw him reading
he at once gave smerdyakov the key of the bookcase come read you shall be my librarian you ll be better sitting reading than hanging about the courtyard
come read this and fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov gave him evening in a cottage near dikanka he read a little but didnt like it
he did not once smile and ended by frowning why isnt it funny asked fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov smerdyakov did not speak
answer stupid it all untrue mumbled the boy with a grin then go to the devil you have the soul of a lackey
stay here smaragdov universal history that all true read that but smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of smaragdov
he thought it dull so the bookcase was closed again shortly afterwards marfa and grigory_vassilyevitch reported to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov that smerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary fastidiousness
he would sit before his soup take up his spoon and look into the soup bend over it examine it take a spoonful and hold it to the light
what is it a beetle grigory_vassilyevitch would ask a fly perhaps observed marfa the squeamish youth never answered but he did the same with his bread his meat and everything he ate
he would hold a piece on his fork to the light scrutinize it microscopically and only after long deliberation decide to put it in his mouth
when fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov heard of this development in smerdyakov he determined to make him his cook and sent him to moscow to be trained
ach what fine gentlemen airs grigory_vassilyevitch muttered looking at him he spent some years there and came back remarkably changed in appearance
he looked extraordinarily old for his age his face had grown wrinkled yellow and strangely emasculate in character he seemed almost exactly the same as before he went away
he was just as unsociable and showed not the slightest inclination for any companionship in moscow too as we heard afterwards he had always been silent
moscow itself had little interest for him he saw very little there and took scarcely any notice of anything he went once to the theater but returned silent and displeased with it
he brushed his clothes most scrupulously twice a day invariably and was very fond of cleaning his smart calf boots with a special english polish so that they shone like mirrors
on the other hand he came back to us from moscow well dressed in a clean coat and clean linen he turned out a first rate cook
but he seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex as for man he was discreet almost unapproachable with them
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov paid him a salary almost the whole of which smerdyakov spent on clothes pomade perfumes and such things fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov began to regard him rather differently
his fits were becoming more frequent and on the day he was ill marfa cooked which did not suit fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov at all
why are your fits getting worse asked fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov looking askance at his new cook would you like to get married
shall i find you a wife but smerdyakov turned pale with anger and made no reply fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov left him with an impatient gesture
it happened once when fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was drunk that he dropped in the muddy courtyard three hundred rouble notes which he had only just received
he only missed them next day and was just hastening to search his pockets when he saw the notes lying on the table
the great thing was that he had absolute confidence in his honesty where had they come from smerdyakov had picked them up and brought them in the day before
we may add that he not only believed in his honesty but had for some reason a liking for him although the young man looked as morosely at him as at every one and was always silent
well my lad i ve never met any one like you fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov said shortly and gave him ten roubles he rarely spoke
if it had occurred to any one to wonder at the time what the young man was interested in and what was in his mind it would have been impossible to tell by looking at him
yet he used sometimes to stop suddenly in the house or even in the yard or street and would stand still for ten minutes lost in thought
a physiognomist studying his face would have said that there was no thought in it no reflection but only a sort of contemplation
there is a forest in winter and on a roadway through the forest in absolute solitude stands a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark shoes
there is a remarkable picture by the painter kramskoy called contemplation he stands as it were lost in thought yet he is not thinking he is contemplating
it true he would come to himself immediately but if he were asked what he had been thinking about he would remember nothing
if any one touched him he would start and look at one as though awakening and bewildered yet probably he has hidden within himself the impression which had dominated him during the period of contemplation
those impressions are dear to him and no doubt he hoards them imperceptibly and even unconsciously how and why of course he does not know either
he may suddenly after hoarding impressions for many years abandon everything and go off to jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his soul salvation or perhaps he will suddenly set fire to his native village and perhaps do both
there are a good many contemplatives among the peasantry well smerdyakov was probably one of them and he probably was greedily hoarding up his impressions hardly knowing why
grigory_vassilyevitch had gone in the morning to make purchases and had heard from the shopkeeper lukyanov the story of a russian soldier which had appeared in the newspaper of that day
this soldier had been taken prisoner in some remote part of asia and was threatened with an immediate agonizing death if he did not renounce christianity and follow islam
chapter vii the controversy but balaam ass had suddenly spoken the subject was a strange one he refused to deny his faith and was tortured flayed alive and died praising and glorifying church_of_christ
grigory_vassilyevitch had related the story at table fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov always liked over the dessert after dinner to laugh and talk if only with grigory_vassilyevitch
sipping his brandy and listening to the story he observed that they ought to make a saint of a soldier like that and to take his skin to some monastery
this afternoon he was in a particularly good humored and expansive mood that would make the people flock and bring the money in
grigory_vassilyevitch frowned seeing that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was by no means touched but as usual was beginning to scoff at that moment smerdyakov who was standing by the door smiled
smerdyakov often waited at table towards the end of dinner and since ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov arrival in our town he had done so every day
what are you grinning at asked fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov catching the smile instantly and knowing that it referred to grigory_vassilyevitch
well my opinion is smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly in a loud voice that if that laudable soldier exploit was so very great there would have been to my thinking no sin in it if he had on such an emergency renounced so to speak the name of church_of_christ and his own christening to save by that same his life for good deeds by which in the course of years to expiate his cowardice
how could it not be a sin you re talking nonsense for that you ll go straight to hell and be roasted there like mutton put in fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
it was at this point that alyosha_karamazov came in and fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov as we have seen was highly delighted at his appearance
as for mutton that not so and there ll be nothing there for this and there shouldnt be either if it according to justice smerdyakov maintained stoutly
we re on your subject your subject he chuckled gleefully making alyosha_karamazov sit down to listen how do you mean according to justice
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov cried still more gayly nudging alyosha_karamazov with his knee he a rascal that what he is burst from grigory_vassilyevitch
he looked smerdyakov wrathfully in the face as for being a rascal wait a little grigory_vassilyevitch answered smerdyakov with perfect composure
you better consider yourself that once i am taken prisoner by the enemies of the christian race and they demand from me to curse the name of god and to renounce my holy christening i am fully entitled to act by my own reason since there would be no sin in it
but you ve said that before dont waste words prove it cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov soup maker muttered grigory_vassilyevitch contemptuously
for as soon as i say to those enemies no i not a christian and i curse my true god then at once by god high judgment i become immediately and specially anathema accursed and am cut off from the holy church_of_christ exactly as though i were a heathen so that at that very instant not only when i say it aloud but when i think of saying it before a quarter of a second has passed i am cut off
as for being a soup maker wait a bit too and consider for yourself grigory_vassilyevitch without abusing me is that so or not grigory_vassilyevitch
he addressed grigory_vassilyevitch with obvious satisfaction though he was really answering fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov questions and was well aware of it and intentionally pretending that grigory_vassilyevitch had asked the questions
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov suddenly stoop down for me to whisper he got this all up for your benefit he wants you to praise him
praise him ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov listened with perfect seriousness to his father_zossima excited whisper stay smerdyakov be quiet a minute cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov once more
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov your ear again ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov bent down again with a perfectly grave face i love you as i do alyosha_karamazov
dont think i dont love you some brandy yes but you re rather drunk yourself thought ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov looking steadily at his father_zossima he was watching smerdyakov with great curiosity
you re anathema accursed as it is grigory_vassilyevitch suddenly burst out and how dare you argue you rascal after that if dont scold him grigory_vassilyevitch dont scold him fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov cut him short
you should wait grigory_vassilyevitch if only a short time and listen for i havent finished all i had to say
for at the very moment i become accursed at that same highest moment i become exactly like a heathen and my christening is taken off me and becomes of no avail
isnt that so make haste and finish my boy fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov urged him sipping from his wine glass with relish
and if i ve ceased to be a christian then i told no lie to the enemy when they asked whether i was a christian or not a christian seeing i had already been relieved by god himself of my christianity by reason of the thought alone before i had time to utter a word to the enemy
and if i have already been discharged in what manner and with what sort of justice can i be held responsible as a christian in the other world for having denied church_of_christ when through the very thought alone before denying him i had been relieved from my christening
if i no longer a christian then i cant renounce church_of_christ for i ve nothing then to renounce who will hold an unclean tatar responsible grigory_vassilyevitch even in heaven for not having been born a christian
for god almighty himself even if he did make the tatar responsible when he dies would give him the smallest possible punishment i imagine since he must be punished judging that he is not to blame if he has come into the world an unclean heathen from heathen parents
and who would punish him for that considering that you cant take two skins off one ox the lord god cant surely take a tatar and say he was a christian
that would mean that the almighty would tell a real untruth and can the lord of heaven and earth tell a lie even in one word
though he did not clearly understand what was said he had caught something in this rigmarole and stood looking like a man who has just hit his head against a wall
grigory_vassilyevitch was thunderstruck and looked at the orator his eye nearly starting out of his head fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov emptied his glass and went off into his shrill laugh
alyosha_karamazov alyosha what do you say to that ah you casuist he must have been with the jesuits somewhere ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov oh you stinking jesuit who taught you
but you re talking nonsense you casuist nonsense nonsense nonsense dont cry grigory_vassilyevitch we ll reduce him to smoke and ashes in a moment
tell me this ass you may be right before your enemies but you have renounced your faith all the same in your own heart and you say yourself that in that very hour you became anathema accursed
and if once you re anathema they wont pat you on the head for it in hell what do you say to that my fine jesuit
there is no doubt that i have renounced it in my own heart but there was no special sin in that
or if there was sin it was the most ordinary how that the most ordinary you lie accursed one hissed grigory_vassilyevitch
consider yourself grigory_vassilyevitch smerdyakov went on staid and unruffled conscious of his triumph but as it were generous to the vanquished foe
consider yourself grigory_vassilyevitch it is said in the scripture that if you have faith even as a mustard seed and bid a mountain move into the sea it will move without the least delay at your bidding
well grigory_vassilyevitch if i without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me you try yourself telling this mountain not to move into the sea for that a long way off but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden
you ll see for yourself that it wont budge but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it and that shows grigory_vassilyevitch that you havent faith in the proper manner and only abuse others about it
again taking into consideration that no one in our day not only you but actually no one from the highest person to the lowest peasant can shove mountains into the sea except perhaps some one man in the world or at most two and they most likely are saving their soul in secret somewhere in the egyptian desert so you wouldnt find them if so it be if all the rest have no faith will god curse all the rest
that is the population of the whole earth except about two hermits in the desert and in his well known mercy will he not forgive one of them
and so i persuaded that though i may once have doubted i shall be forgiven if i shed tears of repentance
stay cried fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in a transport of delight so you do suppose there are two who can move mountains
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov make a note of it write it down there you have the russian all over you re quite right in saying it characteristic of the people faith ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov assented with an approving smile
you agree then it must be so if you agree it true isnt it alyosha_karamazov that the russian faith all over isnt it
no smerdyakov has not the russian faith at all said alyosha_karamazov firmly and gravely i not talking about his faith
i mean those two in the desert only that idea surely that russian isnt it yes that purely russian said alyosha_karamazov smiling
your words are worth a gold piece ass and i ll give it to you to day but as to the rest you talk nonsense nonsense nonsense
let me tell you stupid that we here are all of little faith only from carelessness because we havent time things are too much for us and in the second place the lord god has given us so little time only twenty four hours in the day so that one hasnt even time to get sleep enough much less to repent of one sins
while you have denied your faith to your enemies when you nothing else to think about but to show your faith
so i consider brother that it constitutes a sin constitute a sin it may but consider yourself grigory_vassilyevitch that it only extenuates it if it does constitute
if i had believed then in very truth as i ought to have believed then it really would have been sinful if i had not faced tortures for my faith and had gone over to the pagan mohammedan faith
but of course it wouldnt have come to torture then because i should only have had to say at that instant to the mountain move and crush the tormentor and it would have moved and at the very instant have crushed him like a black beetle and i should have walked away as though nothing had happened praising and glorifying god
but suppose at that very moment i had tried all that and cried to that mountain crush these tormentors and it hadnt crushed them how could i have helped doubting pray at such a time and at such a dread hour of mortal terror
and apart from that i should know already that i could not attain to the fullness of the kingdom of heaven
for since the mountain had not moved at my word they could not think very much of my faith up aloft and there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to come
for even though they had flayed my skin half off my back even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or at my cry
and at such a moment not only doubt might come over one but one might lose one reason from fear so that one would not be able to think at all
and therefore how should i be particularly to blame if not seeing my advantage or reward there or here i should at least save my skin
and so trusting fully in the grace of the lord i should cherish the hope that i might be altogether forgiven
so why should i let them flay the skin off me as well and to no good purpose chapter viii
over the brandy the controversy was over but strange to say fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who had been so gay suddenly began frowning
he frowned and gulped brandy and it was already a glass too much get along with you jesuits he cried to the servants
go away smerdyakov i ll send you the gold piece i promised you to day but be off dont cry grigory_vassilyevitch go to marfa
the rascals wont let us sit in peace after dinner he snapped peevishly as the servants promptly withdrew at his word
she ll comfort you and put you to bed smerdyakov always pokes himself in now after dinner it you he so interested in
what have you done to fascinate him he added to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nothing whatever answered ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he pleased to have a high opinion of me he a lackey and a mean soul
raw material for revolution however when the time comes for revolution there will be others and better ones but there will be some like him as well
his kind will come first and better ones after and when will the time come the rocket will go off and fizzle out perhaps
the peasants are not very fond of listening to these soup makers so far ah brother but a balaam ass like that thinks and thinks and the devil knows where he gets to
you see i know he cant bear me nor any one else even you though you fancy that he has a high opinion of you
but he doesnt steal that one thing and he not a gossip he holds his tongue and doesnt wash our dirty linen in public
he storing up ideas said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov smiling worse still with alyosha_karamazov he despises alyosha_karamazov he makes capital fish pasties too
but damn him is he worth talking about so much of course he isnt and as for the ideas he may be hatching the russian peasant generally speaking needs thrashing
that i ve always maintained our peasants are swindlers and dont deserve to be pitied and it a good thing they re still flogged sometimes
russia is rich in birches if they destroyed the forests it would be the ruin of russia i stand up for the clever people
we ve left off thrashing the peasants we ve grown so clever but they go on thrashing themselves and a good thing too
for with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again or how does it go anyhow it will be measured
but russia all swinishness my dear if you only knew how i hate russia that is not russia but all this vice
but maybe i mean russia tout cela est de la cochonnerie do you know what i like i like wit
you ve had another glass that enough wait a bit i ll have one more and then another and then i ll stop
at mokroe i was talking to an old man and he told me there nothing we like so much as sentencing girls to be thrashed and we always give the lads the job of thrashing them
no stay you interrupted me and the girl he has thrashed to day the young man will ask in marriage to morrow so it quite suits the girls too he said

but i was excited but there wit in that elder dont you think ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov very likely there is there is
il a du piron lŕ dedans he a jesuit a russian one that is as he an honorable person there a hidden indignation boiling within him at having to pretend and affect holiness
but of course he believes in god not a bit of it didnt you know why he tells every one so himself
that is not every one but all the clever people who come to him he said straight out to governor schultz not long ago credo but i dont know in what
really he really did but i respect him there something of mephistopheles about him or rather of the hero of our time
he such a sensualist that i should be afraid for my daughter or my wife if she went to confess to him
the year before last he invited us to tea tea with liqueur the lady send him liqueur and began telling us about old time till we nearly split our sides
arbenin or what his name you see he a sensualist you know when he begins telling stories especially how he once cured a paralyzed woman
if my legs were not bad i know a dance i could dance you he said what do you say to that
i ve plenty of tricks in my time said he he did dernidov the merchant out of sixty thousand what he stole it
he brought him the money as a man he could trust saying take care of it for me friend there ll be a police search at my place to morrow
and he kept it you have given it to the church_of_christ he declared i said to him you re a scoundrel i said
no said he i not a scoundrel but i broad minded but that wasnt he that was some one else i ve muddled him with some one else without noticing it
come another glass and that enough take away the bottle ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i ve been telling lies why didnt you stop me ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and tell me i was lying
i knew you stop of yourself that a lie you did it from spite from simple spite against me you despise me
you have come to me and despised me in my own house well i going away you ve had too much brandy
i ve begged you for church_of_christ sake to go to tchermashnya for a day or two and you dont go
i ll go to morrow if you re so set upon it you wont go you want to keep an eye on me that what you want spiteful fellow
he had reached that state of drunkenness when the drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and to assert himself
that why you wont go the old man persisted why are you looking at me why do you look like that
your eye look at me and say you ugly drunkard your eye are mistrustful they re contemptuous you ve come here with some design
alyosha_karamazov here looks at me and his eye shine alyosha_karamazov doesnt despise me alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov you mustnt love ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dont be ill tempered with my brother
leave off attacking him alyosha_karamazov said emphatically oh all right ugh my head aches take away the brandy ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov it the third time i ve told you
he mused and suddenly a slow cunning grin spread over his face dont be angry with a feeble old man ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
i know you dont love me but dont be angry all the same you ve nothing to love me for you go to tchermashnya
i ll come to you myself and bring you a present i ll show you a little wench there i ve had my eye on her a long time
she still running about bare foot dont be afraid of bare footed wenches dont despise them they re pearls and he kissed his hand with a smack
to my thinking he revived at once seeming to grow sober the instant he touched on his favorite topic
to my thinking ah you boys you child little sucking pigs to my thinking i never thought a woman ugly in my life
that been my rule can you understand that how could you understand it you ve milk in your veins not blood you re not out of your shells yet
my rule has been that you can always find something devilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldnt find in any other
only one must know how to find it that the point that a talent to my mind there are no ugly women
even in vieilles filles even in them you may discover something that makes you simply wonder that man have been such fools as to let them grow old without noticing them
the very fact that she is a woman is half the battle but how could you understand that bare footed girls or unattractive ones you must take by surprise
you must astound them till they re fascinated upset ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with such a little slut
it a jolly good thing that there always are and will be master and slaves in the world so there always will be a little maid of all work and her master and you know that all that needed for happiness
didnt you know that stay listen alyosha_karamazov i always used to surprise your mother but in a different way i paid no attention to her at all but
all at once when the minute came i be all devotion to her crawl on my knees kiss her feet and i always always i remember it as though it were to day reduced her to that tinkling quiet nervous queer little laugh
the next day she would begin shrieking hysterically and this little laugh was not a sign of delight though it made a very good counterfeit
it was peculiar to her i knew her attacks always used to begin like that that the great thing to know how to take every one
once belyavsky he was a handsome fellow and rich used to like to come here and hang about her suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her presence
and she such a mild sheep why i thought she would have knocked me down for that blow how she set on me
you re beaten beaten now she said you ve taken a blow from him you have been trying to sell me to him she said
and how dared he strike you in my presence dont dare come near me again never never run at once challenge him to a duel
i took her to the monastery then to bring her to her senses the holy fathers prayed her back to reason
but i swear by god alyosha_karamazov i never insulted the poor crazy girl only once perhaps in the first year then she was very fond of praying
she used to keep the feasts of our lady particularly and used to turn me out of her room then i ll knock that mysticism out of her thought i_
here said i you see your holy image here it is here i take it down you believe it miraculous but here i ll spit on it directly and nothing will happen to me for it
but she only jumped up wrung her hands then suddenly hid her face in them began trembling all over and fell on the floor fell all of a heap
when she saw it good lord i thought she would kill me alyosha_karamazov alyosha what the matter the old man jumped up in alarm
from the time he had begun speaking about his mother a change had gradually come over alyosha_karamazov face he flushed crimson his eye glowed his lips quivered
the old sot had gone spluttering on noticing nothing till the moment when something very strange happened to alyosha_karamazov precisely what he was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly repeated with alyosha_karamazov
he jumped up from his seat exactly as his mother was said to have done wrung his hands hid his face in them and fell back in his chair shaking all over in an hysterical paroxysm of sudden violent silent weeping
his extraordinary resemblance to his mother particularly impressed the old man ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan water quickly it like her exactly as she used to be then his mother
spurt some water on him from your mouth that what i used to do to her he upset about his mother his mother he muttered to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
but she was my mother too i believe his mother was she not said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with uncontrolled anger and contempt
but something very strange had happened though only for a second it seemed really to have escaped the old man mind that alyosha_karamazov mother actually was the mother of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov too
the old man shrank before his flashing eye your mother he muttered not understanding what do you mean
what mother are you talking about was she why damn it of course she was yours too damn it my mind has never been so darkened before
at that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall there were violent shouts the door was flung open and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov burst into the room
excuse me why i was thinking ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he he he he stopped a broad drunken half senseless grin overspread his face the old man rushed to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in terror
he ll kill me he ll kill me dont let him get at me he screamed clinging to the skirt of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov coat
they had been struggling with him in the passage refusing to admit him acting on instructions given them by fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov some day before
taking advantage of the fact that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him grigory_vassilyevitch ran round the table closed the double doors on the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments and stood before the closed doors stretching wide his arms prepared to defend the entrance so to speak with the last drop of his blood
chapter ix the sensualists grigory_vassilyevitch and smerdyakov ran into the room after dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov seeing this dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at grigory_vassilyevitch
then she there she hidden there out of the way scoundrel he tried to pull grigory_vassilyevitch away but the old servant pushed him back
beside himself with fury dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov struck out and hit grigory_vassilyevitch with all his might the old man fell like a log and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov leaping over him broke in the door
smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room huddling close to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov she here shouted dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
i saw her turn towards the house just now but i couldnt catch her where is she where is she
that shout she here produced an indescribable effect on fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov all his terror left him hold him hold him
he cried and dashed after dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov meanwhile grigory_vassilyevitch had got up from the floor but still seemed stunned ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and alyosha_karamazov ran after their father_zossima
in the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash it was a large glass vase not an expensive one on a marble pedestal which dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov had upset as he ran past it
at him shouted the old man help ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and alyosha_karamazov caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back
why do you run after him he ll murder you outright ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried wrathfully at his father_zossima ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov she must be here
grushenka here he said he saw her himself running he was choking he was not expecting grushenka at the time and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself
he was trembling all over he seemed frantic but you ve seen for yourself that she hasnt come cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
but she may have come by that other entrance you know that entrance is locked and you have the key
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly reappeared in the drawing room he had of course found the other entrance locked and the key actually was in fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov pocket
the windows of all the rooms were also closed so grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere
hold him shrieked fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov as soon as he saw him again he been stealing money in my bedroom
but dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples tugged at them and flung him with a crash on the floor
and tearing himself from ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he rushed again at dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov he kicked him two or three time with his heel in the face
the old man moaned shrilly ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov though not so strong as dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov threw his arms round him and with all his might pulled him away
alyosha_karamazov helped him with his slender strength holding dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov in front madman you ve killed him cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov serve him right
shouted dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov breathlessly if i havent killed him i ll come again and kill him you cant protect him dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
go away at once cried alyosha_karamazov commandingly alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov you tell me it only you i can believe was she here just now or not
i saw her myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane i shouted she ran away i swear she not been here and no one expected her
but i saw her so she must i ll find out at once where she is good by alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov not a word to ćsop about the money now
but go to katerina_ivanovna at once and be sure to say he sends his compliments to you compliments his compliments
just compliments and farewell describe the scene to her meanwhile ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and grigory_vassilyevitch had raised the old man and seated him in an arm chair
his face was covered with blood but he was conscious and listened greedily to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov cries he was still fancying that grushenka really was somewhere in the house
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov looked at him with hatred as he went out i dont repent shedding your blood he cried
beware old man beware of your dream for i have my dream too i curse you and disown you altogether
he ran out of the room she here she must be here smerdyakov smerdyakov the old man wheezed scarcely audibly beckoning to him with his finger
no she not here you old lunatic ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov shouted at him angrily here he fainting water a towel make haste smerdyakov
smerdyakov ran for water at last they got the old man undressed and put him to bed they wrapped a wet towel round his head
exhausted by the brandy by his violent emotion and the blows he had received he shut his eye and fell asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and alyosha_karamazov went back to the drawing room smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase while grigory_vassilyevitch stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor
shouldnt you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed too alyosha_karamazov said to him we ll look after him
my brother gave you a terrible blow on the head he insulted me grigory_vassilyevitch articulated gloomily and distinctly he insulted his father_zossima not only you observed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a forced smile
i used to wash him in his tub he insulted me repeated grigory_vassilyevitch damn it all if i hadnt pulled him away perhaps he have murdered him
it wouldnt take much to do for ćsop would it whispered ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to alyosha_karamazov god forbid cried alyosha_karamazov why should he forbid
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went on in the same whisper with a malignant grimace one reptile will devour the other and serve them both right too
alyosha_karamazov shuddered of course i wont let him be murdered as i didnt just now stay here alyosha_karamazov i ll go for a turn in the yard
my head begun to ache alyosha_karamazov went to his father_zossima bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the screen for about an hour
the old man suddenly opened his eye and gazed for a long while at alyosha_karamazov evidently remembering and meditating all at once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement
alyosha_karamazov he whispered apprehensively where ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in the yard he got a headache he on the watch give me that looking glass
it stands over there give it me alyosha_karamazov gave him a little round folding looking glass which stood on the chest of drawers
the old man looked at himself in it his nose was considerably swollen and on the left side of his forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise
what does ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov say alyosha_karamazov my dear my only son i afraid of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i more afraid of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov than the other
you re the only one i not afraid of dont be afraid of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov either he is angry but he ll defend you
alyosha_karamazov and what of the other he run to grushenka my angel tell me the truth was she here just now or not
no one has seen her it was a mistake she has not been here you know mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov wants to marry her to marry her
she wont marry him she wont she wont she wont she wont on any account the old man fairly fluttered with joy as though nothing more comforting could have been said to him
in his delight he seized alyosha_karamazov hand and pressed it warmly to his heart tears positively glittered in his eye
that image of the mother of god of which i was telling you just now he said take it home and keep it for yourself
and i ll let you go back to the monastery i was joking this morning dont be angry with me my head aches alyosha_karamazov
alyosha_karamazov comfort my heart be an angel and tell me the truth you re still asking whether she has been here or not
i ll tell you what it is you go to grushenka yourself or see her somehow make haste and ask her see for yourself which she means to choose him or me
alyosha_karamazov said sorrowfully no no no i believe you eh what can you if i see her i ll ask her alyosha_karamazov muttered embarrassed
no she wont tell you the old man interrupted she a rogue she ll begin kissing you and say that it you she wants
she a deceitful shameless hussy you mustnt go to her you mustnt no father_zossima and it wouldnt be suitable it wouldnt be right at all
where was he sending you just now he shouted go as he ran away to katerina_ivanovna for money to ask her for money
no not for money he no money not a farthing i ll settle down for the night and think things over and you can go
perhaps you ll meet her only be sure to come to me to morrow in the morning be sure to i have a word to say to you to morrow
will you come yes when you come pretend you ve come of your own accord to ask after me dont tell any one i told you to
dont say a word to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov very well good by my angel you stood up for me just now i shall never forget it
i ve a word to say to you to morrow but i must think about it and how do you feel now i shall get up to morrow and go out perfectly well perfectly well
crossing the yard alyosha_karamazov found ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov sitting on the bench at the gateway he was sitting writing something in pencil in his note book
alyosha_karamazov told ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that their father_zossima had waked up was conscious and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery
alyosha_karamazov i should be very glad to meet you to morrow morning said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cordially standing up his cordiality was a complete surprise to alyosha_karamazov
i shall be at the hohlakovs to morrow answered alyosha_karamazov i may be at katerina_ivanovna too if i dont find her now
but you re going to her now anyway for that compliments and farewell said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov smiling alyosha_karamazov was disconcerted
i think i quite understand his exclamations just now and part of what went before dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov has asked you to go to her and say that he well in fact takes his leave of her
brother how will all this horror end between father_zossima and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov exclaimed alyosha_karamazov one cant tell for certain
perhaps in nothing it may all fizzle out that woman is a beast in any case we must keep the old man indoors and not let dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov in the house
brother let me ask one thing more has any man a right to look at other man and decide which is worthy to live
why bring in the question of worth the matter is most often decided in man hearts on other grounds much more natural
and as for rights who has not the right to wish not for another man death what even if for another man death
why lie to oneself since all man live so and perhaps cannot help living so are you referring to what i said just now that one reptile will devour the other
in that case let me ask you do you think me like dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov capable of shedding ćsop blood murdering him eh
what are you saying ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov such an idea never crossed my mind i dont think dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov is capable of it either
thanks if only for that smiled ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov be sure i should always defend him but in my wishes i reserve myself full latitude in this case
good by till to morrow dont condemn me and dont look on me as a villain he added with a smile they shook hands warmly as they had never done before
alyosha_karamazov felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him and that he had certainly done this with some definite motive
both together alyosha_karamazov left his father_zossima house feeling even more exhausted and dejected in spirit than when he had entered it
his mind too seemed shattered and unhinged while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflicting experiences of the day
towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the fatal insoluble question how would things end between his father_zossima and his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov with this terrible woman
chapter he felt something bordering upon despair which he had never known till then now he had himself been a witness of it he had been present and seen them face to face
yet only his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov could be made unhappy terribly completely unhappy there was trouble awaiting him it appeared too that there were other people concerned far more so than alyosha_karamazov could have supposed before
there was something positively mysterious in it too ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had made a step towards him which was what alyosha_karamazov had been long desiring
strange to say that morning he had set out for katerina_ivanovna in the greatest embarrassment now he felt nothing of the kind
yet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it and these women on the contrary he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance from her
the matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope might sink to any depth
yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult than before he had moreover told him to describe to katerina_ivanovna the scene which had just taken place with his father_zossima
it was by now seven clock and it was getting dark as alyosha_karamazov entered the very spacious and convenient house in the high street occupied by katerina_ivanovna
one of them a woman of little education was that aunt of her half sister agafya_ivanovna who had looked after her in her father_zossima house when she came from boarding school
alyosha_karamazov knew that she lived with two aunts the other aunt was a moscow lady of style and consequence though in straitened circumstances
it was said that they both gave way in everything to katerina_ivanovna and that she only kept them with her as chaperons
but her benefactress the general widow who had been kept by illness in moscow and to whom she was obliged to write twice a week a full account of all her doings
when alyosha_karamazov entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door to him to take his name up it was evident that they were already aware of his arrival
katerina_ivanovna herself gave way to no one possibly he had been noticed from the window at least alyosha_karamazov heard a noise caught the sound of flying footsteps and rustling skirts
two or three women perhaps had run out of the room alyosha_karamazov thought it strange that his arrival should cause such excitement
he was conducted however to the drawing room at once it was a large room elegantly and amply furnished not at all in provincial style
there were pictures on the walls vases and lamps on the tables masses of flowers and even an aquarium in the window
alyosha_karamazov made out a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa where people had evidently just been sitting and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups of chocolate cakes a glass saucer with blue raisins and another with sweetmeats
there were many sofas lounges settees big and little tables it was twilight and rather dark alyosha_karamazov saw that he had interrupted visitors and frowned
but at that instant the portičre was raised and with rapid hurrying footsteps katerina_ivanovna came in holding out both hands to alyosha_karamazov with a radiant smile of delight
at the same instant a servant brought in two lighted candles and set them on the table thank god at last you have come too
alyosha_karamazov had been struck by katerina_ivanovna beauty when three weeks before dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov had first brought him at katerina_ivanovna special request to be introduced to her
i ve been simply praying for you all day sit down there had been no conversation between them at that interview however
supposing alyosha_karamazov to be very shy katerina_ivanovna had talked all the time to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov to spare him alyosha_karamazov had been silent but he had seen a great deal very clearly
he was struck by the imperiousness proud ease and self confidence of the haughty girl and all that was certain alyosha_karamazov felt that he was not exaggerating it
but in those eye and in the lines of her exquisite lips there was something with which his brother might well be passionately in love but which perhaps could not be loved for long
he expressed this thought almost plainly to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov when after the visit his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal his impressions on seeing his betrothed
he thought her great glowing black eye were very fine especially with her pale even rather sallow longish face you ll be happy with her but perhaps not tranquilly happy
quite so brother such people remain always the same they dont yield to fate so you think i shant love her for ever
alyosha_karamazov had given his opinion at the time blushing and angry with himself for having yielded to his brother entreaty and put such foolish ideas into words
no perhaps you will love her for ever but perhaps you wont always be happy with her for his opinion had struck him as awfully foolish immediately after he had uttered it
it was with the more amazement that he felt now at the first glance at katerina_ivanovna as she ran in to him that he had perhaps been utterly mistaken
he felt ashamed too of having given so confident an opinion about a woman this time her face was beaming with spontaneous good natured kindliness and direct warm hearted sincerity
the pride and haughtiness which had struck alyosha_karamazov so much before was only betrayed now in a frank generous energy and a sort of bright strong faith in herself
alyosha_karamazov realized at the first glance at the first word that all the tragedy of her position in relation to the man she loved so dearly was no secret to her that she perhaps already knew everything positively everything
and yet in spite of that there was such brightness in her face such faith in the future alyosha_karamazov felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in his thoughts
besides all this he noticed at her first words that she was in great excitement an excitement perhaps quite exceptional and almost approaching ecstasy
i was so eager to see you because i can learn from you the whole truth from you and no one else
he was conquered and captivated immediately i have come muttered alyosha_karamazov confusedly i he sent me ah he sent you i foresaw that
now i know everything everything cried katerina_ivanovna her eye flashing wait a moment alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i ll tell you why i ve been so longing to see you
you see i know perhaps far more than you do yourself and there no need for you to tell me anything
i want you to tell me most directly plainly coarsely even oh as coarsely as you like what you thought of him just now and of his position after your meeting with him to day
that will perhaps be better than if i had a personal explanation with him as he does not want to come to me
i ll tell you what i want from you i want to know your own last impression of him do you understand what i want from you
now tell me simply tell me every word of the message he sent you with i knew he would send you
he told me to give you his compliments and to say that he would never come again but to give you his compliments
his compliments was that what he said his own expression yes accidentally perhaps he made a mistake in the word perhaps he did not use the right word
no he told me precisely to repeat that word he begged me two or three time not to forget to say so
katerina_ivanovna flushed hotly help me now alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov now i really need your help i ll tell you what i think and you must simply say whether it right or not
if he had sent me his compliments in passing without insisting on your repeating the words without emphasizing them that would be the end of everything
but if he particularly insisted on those words if he particularly told you not to forget to repeat them to me then perhaps he was in excitement beside himself
listen he had made his decision and was frightened at it he wasnt walking away from me with a resolute step but leaping headlong
the emphasis on that phrase may have been simply bravado yes yes cried alyosha_karamazov warmly i believe that is it
and if so he not altogether lost i can still save him stay did he not tell you anything about money about three thousand roubles
he said he had lost his honor and that nothing matters now alyosha_karamazov answered warmly feeling a rush of hope in his heart and believing that there really might be a way of escape and salvation for his brother
he did speak about it and it that more than anything that crushing him but do you know about the money
i ve known of it a long time i telegraphed to moscow to inquire and heard long ago that the money had not arrived
he added and suddenly broke off he hadnt sent the money but i said nothing last week i learnt that he was still in need of money
my only object in all this was that he should know to whom to turn and who was his true friend
no he wont recognize that i am his truest friend he wont know me and looks on me merely as a woman
i ve been tormented all the week trying to think how to prevent him from being ashamed to face me because he spent that three thousand
let him feel ashamed of himself let him be ashamed of other people knowing but not of my knowing he can tell god everything without shame
why is it he still does not understand how much i am ready to bear for his sake why why doesnt he know me
how dare he not know me after all that has happened i want to save him for ever let him forget me as his betrothed
and here he fears that he is dishonored in my eye why he wasnt afraid to be open with you alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
how is it that i dont deserve the same the last words she uttered in tears tears gushed from her eye
i must tell you alyosha_karamazov began his voice trembling too what happened just now between him and my father_zossima
and he described the whole scene how dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov had sent him to get the money how he had broken in knocked his father_zossima down and after that had again specially and emphatically begged him to take his compliments and farewell
he went to that woman alyosha_karamazov added softly and do you suppose that i cant put up with that woman
does he think i cant but he wont marry her she suddenly laughed nervously could such a passion last for ever in a alyosha_karamazov
it passion not love he wont marry her because she wont marry him again katerina_ivanovna laughed strangely he may marry her said alyosha_karamazov mournfully looking down
he wont marry her i tell you that girl is an angel do you know that do you know that
katerina_ivanovna exclaimed suddenly with extraordinary warmth she is one of the most fantastic of fantastic creatures i know how bewitching she is but i know too that she is kind firm and noble
why do you look at me like that alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov perhaps you are wondering at my words perhaps you dont believe me
agrafena_alexandrovna my angel she cried suddenly to some one peeping into the next room come in to us this is a friend
i ve only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me said a soft one might even say sugary feminine voice
this is alyosha_karamazov he knows all about our affairs show yourself to him the portičre was raised and grushenka herself smiling and beaming came up to the table
a violent revulsion passed over alyosha_karamazov he fixed his eye on her and could not take them off here she was that awful woman the beast as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had called her half an hour before
and yet one would have thought the creature standing before him most simple and ordinary a good natured kind woman handsome certainly but
so like other handsome ordinary women it is true she was very very good looking with that russian beauty so passionately loved by many man
she was a rather tall woman though a little shorter than katerina_ivanovna who was exceptionally tall she had a full figure with soft as it were noiseless movements softened to a peculiar over sweetness like her voice
she moved not like katerina_ivanovna with a vigorous bold step but noiselessly her feet made absolutely no sound on the floor
she sank softly into a low chair softly rustling her sumptuous black silk dress and delicately nestling her milk white neck and broad shoulders in a costly cashmere shawl
she was twenty two years old and her face looked exactly that age she was very white in the face with a pale pink tint on her cheeks
the modeling of her face might be said to be too broad and the lower jaw was set a trifle forward
but her magnificent abundant dark brown hair her sable colored eyebrows and charming gray blue eye with their long lashes would have made the most indifferent person meeting her casually in a crowd in the street stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after
her upper lip was thin but the slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full and looked pouting what struck alyosha_karamazov most in that face was its expression of childlike good nature
there was a childlike look in her eye a look of childish delight she came up to the table beaming with delight and seeming to expect something with childish impatient and confiding curiosity
there was something else in her which he could not understand or would not have been able to define and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him
the light in her eye gladdened the soul alyosha_karamazov felt that it was that softness that voluptuousness of her bodily movements that catlike noiselessness
yet it was a vigorous ample body under the shawl could be seen full broad shoulders a high still quite girlish bosom
connoisseurs of russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this fresh still youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of thirty would spread that the face would become puffy and that wrinkles would very soon appear upon her forehead and round the eye the complexion would grow coarse and red perhaps in fact that it was the beauty of the moment the fleeting beauty which is so often met with in russian women
alyosha_karamazov of course did not think of this but though he was fascinated yet he wondered with an unpleasant sensation and as it were regretfully why she drawled in that way and could not speak naturally
her figure suggested the lines of the venus of milo though already in somewhat exaggerated proportions that could be divined she did so evidently feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated honeyed modulation of the syllables
and yet this intonation and manner of speaking impressed alyosha_karamazov as almost incredibly incongruous with the childishly simple and happy expression of her face the soft babyish joy in her eye
katerina_ivanovna at once made her sit down in an arm chair facing alyosha_karamazov and ecstatically kissed her several time on her smiling lips
it was of course only a bad underbred habit that showed bad education and a false idea of good manners she seemed quite in love with her
this is the first time we ve met alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov she said rapturously i wanted to know her to see her
i wanted to go to her but i no sooner expressed the wish than she came to me i knew we should settle everything together everything
i was begged not to take the step but i foresaw it would be a way out of the difficulty and i was not mistaken
my heart told me so grushenka has explained everything to me told me all she means to do she flew here like an angel of goodness and brought us peace and joy
you did not disdain me sweet excellent young lady drawled grushenka in her sing song voice still with the same charming smile of delight
dont dare to speak to me like that you sorceress you witch disdain you here i must kiss your lower lip once more
it looks as though it were swollen and now it will be more so and more and more look how she laughs alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
it does one heart good to see the angel alyosha_karamazov flushed and faint imperceptible shivers kept running down him you make so much of me dear young lady and perhaps i am not at all worthy of your kindness
not worthy she not worthy of it katerina_ivanovna cried again with the same warmth you know alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov we re fanciful we re self willed but proudest of the proud in our little heart
we re noble we re generous alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov let me tell you we have only been unfortunate we were too ready to make every sacrifice for an unworthy perhaps or fickle man
there was one man one an officer too we loved him we sacrificed everything to him that was long ago five years ago and he has forgotten us he has married
now he is a widower he has written he is coming here and do you know we ve loved him none but him all this time and we ve loved him all our life
he will come and grushenka will be happy again for the last five years she been wretched but who can reproach her who can boast of her favor
only that bedridden old merchant but he is more like her father_zossima her friend her protector he found her then in despair in agony deserted by the man she loved
she was ready to drown herself then but the old merchant saved her saved her you defend me very kindly dear young lady
you are in a great hurry about everything grushenka drawled again defend you is it for me to defend you should i dare to defend you
it has brought me happiness and has lifted me up and i going to kiss it outside and inside here here here
grushenka angel give me your hand look at that charming soft little hand alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov look at it and three time she kissed the certainly charming though rather fat hand of grushenka in a sort of rapture
she held out her hand with a charming musical nervous little laugh watched the sweet young lady and obviously liked having her hand kissed
perhaps there rather too much rapture thought alyosha_karamazov he blushed he felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time
you wont make me blush dear young lady kissing my hand like this before alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov do you think i meant to make you blush said katerina_ivanovna somewhat surprised
ah my dear how little you understand me yes and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me dear young lady
maybe i not so good as i seem to you i ve a bad heart i will have my own way i fascinated poor dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that day simply for fun
but now you ll save him you ve given me your word you ll explain it all to him you ll break to him that you have long loved another man who is now offering you his hand
oh no i didnt give you my word to do that it was you kept talking about that i didnt give you my word
then i didnt quite understand you said katerina_ivanovna slowly turning a little pale you promised oh no angel lady i ve promised nothing grushenka interrupted softly and evenly still with the same gay and simple expression
you see at once dear young lady what a willful wretch i am compared with you if i want to do a thing i do it
i may have made you some promise just now but now again i thinking i may take to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov again i liked him very much once liked him for almost a whole hour
now maybe i shall go and tell him to stay with me from this day forward you see i so changeable
just now you said something quite different katerina_ivanovna whispered faintly ah just now but you know i such a soft hearted silly creature
only think what he gone through on my account what if when i go home i feel sorry for him what then
i never expected ah young lady how good and generous you are compared with me now perhaps you wont care for a silly creature like me now you know my character
give me your sweet little hand angelic lady she said tenderly and with a sort of reverence took katerina_ivanovna hand
here dear young lady i ll take your hand and kiss it as you did mine you kissed mine three time but i ought to kiss yours three hundred time to be even with you
well but let that pass and then it shall be as god wills perhaps i shall be your slave entirely and want to do your bidding like a slave
let it be as god wills without any agreements and promises what a sweet hand what a sweet hand you have you sweet young lady you incredible beauty
she slowly raised the hands to her lips with the strange object indeed of being even with her in kisses
she listened with timid hope to the last words though grushenka promise to do her bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed
she looked intently into her eye she still saw in those eye the same simple hearted confiding expression the same bright gayety
katerina_ivanovna did not take her hand away she perhaps too naďve thought katerina_ivanovna with a gleam of hope
grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the sweet hand she raised it deliberately to her lips but she held it for two or three minutes near her lips as though reconsidering something
do you know angel lady she suddenly drawled in an even more soft and sugary voice do you know after all i think i wont kiss your hand
and she laughed a little merry laugh as you please what the matter with you said katerina_ivanovna starting suddenly
so that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand but i didnt kiss yours there was a sudden gleam in her eye
she looked with awful intentness at katerina_ivanovna insolent creature cried katerina_ivanovna as though suddenly grasping something she flushed all over and leapt up from her seat
grushenka too got up but without haste so i shall tell mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov how you kissed my hand but i didnt kiss yours at all
and how he will laugh vile slut go away ah for shame young lady ah for shame that unbecoming for you dear young lady
a word like that go away you re a creature for sale screamed katerina_ivanovna every feature was working in her utterly distorted face
for sale indeed you used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once you brought your beauty for sale
you see i know katerina_ivanovna shrieked and would have rushed at her but alyosha_karamazov held her with all his strength
not a step not a word dont speak dont answer her she ll go away she ll go at once at that instant katerina_ivanovna two aunts ran in at her cry and with them a maid servant
all hurried to her i will go away said grushenka taking up her mantle from the sofa alyosha_karamazov darling see me home
go away go away make haste cried alyosha_karamazov clasping his hands imploringly dear little alyosha_karamazov see me home i ve got a pretty little story to tell you on the way
i got up this scene for your benefit alyosha_karamazov see me home dear you ll be glad of it afterwards alyosha_karamazov turned away wringing his hands
grushenka ran out of the house laughing musically katerina_ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics she sobbed and was shaken with convulsions
every one fussed round her i warned you said the elder of her aunts i tried to prevent your doing this
you re too impulsive how could you do such a thing you dont know these creatures and they say she worse than any of them
you are too self willed she a tigress yelled katerina_ivanovna why did you hold me alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i have beaten her beaten her
she could not control herself before alyosha_karamazov perhaps she did not care to indeed she ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold
alyosha_karamazov withdrew towards the door but my god cried katerina_ivanovna clasping her hands he he he could be so dishonorable so inhuman
why he told that creature what happened on that fatal accursed day you brought your beauty for sale dear young lady
she knows it your brother a scoundrel alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov wanted to say something but he couldnt find a word
his heart ached go away alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov it shameful it awful for me to morrow i beg you on my knees come to morrow
dont condemn me forgive me i dont know what i shall do with myself now alyosha_karamazov walked out into the street reeling
he could have wept as she did suddenly he was overtaken by the maid the young lady forgot to give you this letter from madame_hohlakov it been left with us since dinner time
alyosha_karamazov took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it almost unconsciously into his pocket chapter xi another reputation ruined
it was not much more than three quarters of a mile from the town to the monastery alyosha_karamazov walked quickly along the road at that hour deserted
it was almost night and too dark to see anything clearly at thirty paces ahead there were cross roads half way a figure came into sight under a solitary willow at the cross roads
as soon as alyosha_karamazov reached the cross roads the figure moved out and rushed at him shouting savagely your money or your life
so it you mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried alyosha_karamazov in surprise violently startled however ha ha ha you didnt expect me i wondered where to wait for you
by her house there are three ways from it and i might have missed you at last i thought of waiting here for you had to pass here
there no other way to the monastery come tell me the truth crush me like a beetle but what the matter
alyosha_karamazov began to cry he had been on the verge of tears for a long time and now something seemed to snap in his soul
nothing brother it the fright you gave me oh dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov father_zossima blood just now you almost killed him cursed him and now here you re making jokes your money or your life
well what of that it not seemly is that it not suitable in my position no i only stay look at the night
you see what a dark night what clouds what a wind has risen i hid here under the willow waiting for you
here i have a willow a handkerchief a shirt i can twist them into a rope in a minute and braces besides and why go on burdening the earth dishonoring it with my vile presence
and as god above i suddenly thought why go on in misery any longer what is there to wait for and then i heard you coming
here he is that man my dear little brother whom i love more than any one in the world the only one i love in the world
and i loved you so much so much at that moment that i thought i ll fall on his neck at once
heavens it was as though something flew down to me suddenly so there is a man then whom i love then a stupid idea struck me to have a joke with you and scare you
i shouted like a fool your money forgive my foolery it was only nonsense and there nothing unseemly in my soul damn it all tell me what happened
what did she say strike me crush me dont spare me was she furious no not that there was nothing like that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
there i found them both there both whom grushenka at katerina_ivanovna dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was struck dumb impossible he cried you re raving
grushenka with her alyosha_karamazov described all that had happened from the moment he went in to katerina_ivanovna he was ten minutes telling his story
he cant be said to have told it fluently and consecutively but he seemed to make it clear not omitting any word or action of significance and vividly describing often in one word his own sensations
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov listened in silence gazing at him with a terrible fixed stare but it was clear to alyosha_karamazov that he understood it all and had grasped every point
he scowled he clenched his teeth and his fixed stare became still more rigid more concentrated more terrible when suddenly with incredible rapidity his wrathful savage face changed his tightly compressed lips parted and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov broke into uncontrolled spontaneous laughter
but as the story went on his face became not merely gloomy but menacing he literally shook with laughter for a long time he could not speak
so she wouldnt kiss her hand so she didnt kiss it so she ran away he kept exclaiming with hysterical delight insolent delight it might have been called if it had not been so spontaneous
so the other one called her tigress and a tigress she is so she ought to be flogged on a scaffold
yes yes so she ought that just what i think she ought to have been long ago it like this brother let her be punished but i must get better first
i understand the queen of impudence that her all over you saw her all over in that hand kissing the she devil she magnificent in her own line
so she ran home i ll go ah i ll run to her alyosha_karamazov dont blame me i agree that hanging is too good for her
but katerina_ivanovna exclaimed alyosha_karamazov sorrowfully i see her too i see right through her as i ve never done before
it a regular discovery of the four continents of the world that is of the five what a thing to do
that just like katya who was not afraid to face a coarse unmannerly officer and risk a deadly insult on a generous impulse to save her father_zossima
but the pride the recklessness the defiance of fate the unbounded defiance you say that aunt tried to stop her that aunt you know is overbearing herself
she the sister of the general widow in moscow and even more stuck up than she but her husband was caught stealing government money
he lost everything his estate and all and the proud wife had to lower her colors and hasnt raised them since
so she tried to prevent katya but she wouldnt listen to her she thinks she can overcome everything that everything will give way to her
she thought she could bewitch grushenka if she liked and she believed it herself she plays a part to herself and whose fault is it
no she really was fascinated by grushenka that to say not by grushenka but by her own dream her own delusion because it was her dream her delusion
do you think she kissed grushenka hand first on purpose with a motive alyosha_karamazov darling how did you escape from them those women
did you pick up your cassock and run ha ha ha brother you dont seem to have noticed how you ve insulted katerina_ivanovna by telling grushenka about that day
and she flung it in her face just now that she had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her beauty
brother what could be worse than that insult what worried alyosha_karamazov more than anything was that incredible as it seemed his brother appeared pleased at katerina_ivanovna humiliation
he only now realized it though alyosha_karamazov had just told him of the insult and katerina_ivanovna cry your brother is a scoundrel
bah dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov frowned fiercely and struck his forehead with his hand yes perhaps i really did tell grushenka about that fatal day as katya calls it
yes i did tell her i remember it was that time at mokroe i was drunk the gypsies were singing but i was sobbing
i was sobbing then kneeling and praying to katya image and grushenka understood it she understood it all then i remember she cried herself
damn it all but it bound to be so now then she cried but now the dagger in the heart that how women are
he looked down and sank into thought yes i am a scoundrel a thorough scoundrel he said suddenly in a gloomy voice
it doesnt matter whether i cried or not i a scoundrel tell her i accept the name if that any comfort
come that enough good by it no use talking it not amusing you go your way and i mine and i dont want to see you again except as a last resource
he warmly pressed alyosha_karamazov hand and still looking down without raising his head as though tearing himself away turned rapidly towards the town
good by alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov looked after him unable to believe he would go away so abruptly stay alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov one more confession to you alone
cried dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly turning back look at me look at me well you see here here there terrible disgrace in store for me
as he said here dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov struck his chest with his fist with a strange air as though the dishonor lay precisely on his chest in some spot in a pocket perhaps or hanging round his neck
you know me now a scoundrel an avowed scoundrel but let me tell you that i ve never done anything before and never shall again anything that can compare in baseness with the dishonor which i bear now at this very minute on my breast here here which will come to pass though i perfectly free to stop it
i can stop it or carry it through note that well let me tell you i shall carry it through
i told you everything just now but i didnt tell you this because even i had not brass enough for it
i shant stop it i can still pull up if i do i can give back the full half of my lost honor to morrow
but i shant pull up i shall carry out my base plan and you can bear witness that i told you so beforehand
darkness and destruction no need to explain you ll find out in due time the filthy back alley and the she devil good by
dont pray for me i not worth it and there no need no need at all i dont need it away
and he suddenly retreated this time finally alyosha_karamazov went towards the monastery what i shall never see him again
what is he saying he wondered wildly why i shall certainly see him to morrow i shall look him up
i shall make a point of it what does he mean he went round the monastery and crossed the pine wood to the hermitage
the door was opened to him though no one was admitted at that hour there was a tremor in his heart as he went into father_zossima cell
why why had he gone forth why had he sent him into the world here was peace here was holiness
but there was confusion there was darkness in which one lost one way and went astray at once in the cell he found the novice porfiry and father_zossima father_paďssy who came every hour to inquire after father_zossima
alyosha_karamazov learnt with alarm that he was getting worse and worse even his usual discourse with the brothers could not take place that day
as a rule every evening after service the monks flocked into father_zossima cell and all confessed aloud their sins of the day their sinful thoughts and temptations even their disputes if there had been any
it was against this general confession that the opponents of elders protested maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacrament of confession almost a sacrilege though this was quite a different thing
they even represented to the diocesan authorities that such confessions attained no good object but actually to a large extent led to sin and temptation
many of the brothers disliked going to the elder and went against their own will because every one went and for fear they should be accused of pride and rebellious ideas
people said that some of the monks agreed beforehand saying i ll confess i lost my temper with you this morning and you confirm it simply in order to have something to say
some confessed kneeling the elder absolved reconciled exhorted imposed penance blessed and dismissed them alyosha_karamazov knew that this actually happened sometimes
he knew too that there were among the monks some who deeply resented the fact that letters from relations were habitually taken to the elder to be opened and read by him before those to whom they were addressed
it was assumed of course that all this was done freely and in good faith by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance
yet the older and more experienced of the monks adhered to their opinion arguing that for those who have come within these walls sincerely seeking salvation such obedience and sacrifice will certainly be salutary and of great benefit those on the other hand who find it irksome and repine are no true monks and have made a mistake in entering the monastery their proper place is in the world
but in fact there was sometimes no little insincerity and much that was false and strained in this practice even in the temple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil
so it was no good taking it too much into account he is weaker a drowsiness has come over him father_zossima father_paďssy whispered to alyosha_karamazov as he blessed him
it difficult to rouse him and he must not be roused he waked up for five minutes sent his blessing to the brothers and begged their prayers for him at night
he intends to take the sacrament again in the morning he remembered you alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov he asked whether you had gone away and was told that you were in the town
i blessed him for that work he said his place is there not here for awhile those were his words about you
he remembered you lovingly with anxiety do you understand how he honored you but how is it that he has decided that you shall spend some time in the world
understand alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov that if you return to the world it must be to do the duty laid upon you by your elder and not for frivolous vanity and worldly pleasures
he must have foreseen something in your destiny father_zossima father_paďssy went out alyosha_karamazov had no doubt that father_zossima was dying though he might live another day or two
alyosha_karamazov firmly and ardently resolved that in spite of his promises to his father_zossima the hohlakovs and katerina_ivanovna he would not leave the monastery next day but would remain with his elder to the end
his heart glowed with love and he reproached himself bitterly for having been able for one instant to forget him whom he had left in the monastery on his deathbed and whom he honored above every one in the world
he went into father_zossima bedroom knelt down and bowed to the ground before the elder who slept quietly without stirring with regular hardly audible breathing and a peaceful face
taking off his boots he lay down on the hard narrow leathern sofa which he had long used as a bed bringing nothing but a pillow
alyosha_karamazov returned to the other room where father_zossima had received his guests in the morning the mattress about which his father_zossima had shouted to him that morning he had long forgotten to lie on
he took off his cassock which he used as a covering but before going to bed he fell on his knees and prayed a long time
in his fervent prayer he did not beseech god to lighten his darkness but only thirsted for the joyous emotion which always visited his soul after the praise and adoration of which his evening prayer usually consisted
as he was praying he suddenly felt in his pocket the little pink note the servant had handed him as he left katerina_ivanovna
that joy always brought him light untroubled sleep he was disturbed but finished his prayer then after some hesitation he opened the envelope
in it was a letter to him signed by lise the young daughter of madame_hohlakov who had laughed at him before the elder in the morning
alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov she wrote i am writing to you without any one knowledge even mamma and i know how wrong it is
but i cannot live without telling you the feeling that has sprung up in my heart and this no one
but us two must know for a time but how am i to say what i want so much to tell you
paper they say does not blush but i assure you it not true and that it blushing just as i am now all over
dear alyosha_karamazov i love you i ve loved you from my childhood since our moscow day when you were very different from what you are now and i shall love you all my life
my heart has chosen you to unite our lives and pass them together till our old age of course on condition that you will leave the monastery
as for our age we will wait for the time fixed by the law by that time i shall certainly be quite strong i shall be walking and dancing
there can be no doubt of that you see how i ve thought of everything there only one thing i cant imagine what you ll think of me when you read this
i made you angry this morning but i assure you before i took up my pen i prayed before the image of the mother of god and now i praying and almost crying
i always laughing and being naughty my secret is in your hands when you come to morrow i dont know how i shall look at you
ah alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov what if i cant restrain myself like a silly and laugh when i look at you as i did to day
and so i beg you dear one if you ve any pity for me when you come to morrow dont look me straight in the face for if i meet your eye it will be sure to make me laugh especially as you ll be in that long gown
i feel cold all over when i think of it so when you come dont look at me at all for a time look at mamma or at the window
you ll think i a nasty girl making fun of you and you wont believe my letter here i ve written you a love letter
oh dear what have i done alyosha_karamazov dont despise me and if i ve done something very horrid and wounded you forgive me
now the secret of my reputation ruined perhaps for ever is in your hands i shall certainly cry to day good by till our meeting our awful meeting lise
s alyosha_karamazov you must must must come lise alyosha_karamazov read the note in amazement read it through twice thought a little and suddenly laughed a soft sweet laugh
he started that laugh seemed to him sinful but a minute later he laughed again just as softly and happily he slowly replaced the note in the envelope crossed himself and lay down
god have mercy upon all of them have all these unhappy and turbulent soul in thy keeping and set them in the right path
the agitation in his heart passed at once all ways are thine save them according to thy wisdom thou art love
thou wilt send joy to all alyosha_karamazov murmured crossing himself and falling into peaceful sleep part ii book iv lacerations chapter i father_zossima father_ferapont alyosha_karamazov was roused early before daybreak
father_zossima woke up feeling very weak though he wanted to get out of bed and sit up in a chair
his mind was quite clear his face looked very tired yet bright and almost joyful it wore an expression of gayety kindness and cordiality
maybe i shall not live through the coming day he said to alyosha_karamazov then he desired to confess and take the sacrament at once
he always confessed to father_zossima father_paďssy after taking the communion the service of extreme unction followed the monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled up by the inmates of the hermitage
meantime it was daylight people began coming from the monastery after the service was over the elder desired to kiss and take leave of every one
as the cell was so small the earlier visitors withdrew to make room for others alyosha_karamazov stood beside the elder who was seated again in his arm chair
i ve been teaching you so many years and therefore i ve been talking aloud so many years that i ve got into the habit of talking and so much so that it almost more difficult for me to hold my tongue than to talk even now in spite of my weakness dear fathers and brothers he jested looking with emotion at the group round him
he talked as much as he could though his voice was weak it was fairly steady alyosha_karamazov remembered afterwards something of what he said to them
he spoke of many things he seemed anxious before the moment of death to say everything he had not said in his life and not simply for the sake of instructing them but as though thirsting to share with all man and all creation his joy and ecstasy and once more in his life to open his whole heart
but though he spoke out distinctly and his voice was fairly steady his speech was somewhat disconnected love one another fathers said father_zossima as far as alyosha_karamazov could remember afterwards
because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls we are no holier than those that are outside but on the contrary from the very fact of coming here each of us has confessed to himself that he is worse than others than all man on earth
love god people and the longer the monk lives in his seclusion the more keenly he must recognize that else he would have had no reason to come here
when he realizes that he is not only worse than others but that he is responsible to all man for all and everything for all human sins national and individual only then the aim of our seclusion is attained
for know dear ones that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for all man and everything on earth not merely through the general sinfulness of creation but each one personally for all mankind and every individual man
this knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man for monks are not a special sort of man but only what all man ought to be
then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your tears
only through that knowledge our heart grows soft with infinite universal inexhaustible love each of you keep watch over your heart and confess your sins to yourself unceasingly
be not afraid of your sins even when perceiving them if only there be penitence but make no conditions with god
again i say be not proud be proud neither to the little nor to the great hate not those who reject you who insult you who abuse and slander you
hate not the atheists the teachers of evil the materialists and i mean not only the good ones for there are many good ones among them especially in our day hate not even the wicked ones
remember them in your prayers thus save lord all those who have none to pray for them save too all those who will not pray
and add it is not in pride that i make this prayer lord for i am lower than all man
love god people let not strangers draw away the flock for if you slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride or worse still in covetousness they will come from all sides and draw away your flock
expound the gospel to the people unceasingly be not extortionate do not love gold and silver do not hoard them
have faith cling to the banner and raise it on high but the elder spoke more disconnectedly than alyosha_karamazov reported his words afterwards
sometimes he broke off altogether as though to take breath and recover his strength but he was in a sort of ecstasy
when alyosha_karamazov happened for a moment to leave the cell he was struck by the general excitement and suspense in the monks who were crowding about it
they heard him with emotion though many wondered at his words and found them obscure afterwards all remembered those words this anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety in others by devout solemnity
their suspense was from one point of view almost frivolous but even the most austere of the monks were affected by it
all were expecting that some marvel would happen immediately after the elder death father_zossima father_paďssy face looked the gravest of all
alyosha_karamazov was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see mr_rakitin who had arrived from town with a singular letter for him from madame_hohlakov
it appeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to receive father_zossima blessing there had been an old woman from the town a sergeant widow called prohorovna
she had inquired whether she might pray for the rest of the soul of her son vassenka who had gone to irkutsk and had sent her no news for over a year
to which father_zossima had answered sternly forbidding her to do so and saying that to pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery
he afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance and added as though reading the book of the future this was madame_hohlakov expression words of comfort that her son vassya was certainly alive and he would either come himself very shortly or send a letter and that she was to go home and expect him
in it she informed alyosha_karamazov of a strange and very opportune incident and would you believe it exclaimed madame_hohlakov enthusiastically the prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed and more than that
scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave her a letter from siberia which had been awaiting her
but that was not all in the letter written on the road from ekaterinenburg vassya informed his mother that he was returning to russia with an official and that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped to embrace his mother
madame_hohlakov warmly entreated alyosha_karamazov to report this new miracle of prediction to the superior and all the brotherhood
all all ought to know of it she concluded the letter had been written in haste the excitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it
mr_rakitin had commissioned the monk who brought his message to inform most respectfully his reverence father_zossima father_paďssy that he mr_rakitin has a matter to speak of with him of such gravity that he dare not defer it for a moment and humbly begs forgiveness for his presumption
as the monk had given the message to father_zossima father_paďssy before that to alyosha_karamazov the latter found after reading the letter there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to father_zossima father_paďssy in confirmation of the story
and even that austere and cautious man though he frowned as he read the news of the miracle could not completely restrain some inner emotion
but alyosha_karamazov had no need to tell the monks for all knew of it already his eye gleamed and a grave and solemn smile came into his lips
we shall see greater things broke from him we shall see greater things greater things yet the monks around repeated
but father_zossima father_paďssy frowning again begged all of them at least for a time not to speak of the matter till it be more fully confirmed seeing there is so much credulity among those of this world and indeed this might well have chanced naturally he added prudently as it were to satisfy his conscience though scarcely believing his own disavowal a fact his listeners very clearly perceived
within the hour the miracle was of course known to the whole monastery and many visitors who had come for the mass
no one seemed more impressed by it than the monk who had come the day before from st sylvester from the little monastery of obdorsk in the far north
it was he who had been standing near madame_hohlakov the previous day and had asked father_zossima earnestly referring to the healing of the lady daughter how can you presume to do such things
the evening before he had visited father_zossima father_ferapont in his cell apart behind the apiary and had been greatly impressed and overawed by the visit
this father_zossima father_ferapont was that aged monk so devout in fasting and observing silence who has been mentioned already as antagonistic to father_zossima and the whole institution of elders which he regarded as a pernicious and frivolous innovation
he was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe he was a very formidable opponent although from his practice of silence he scarcely spoke a word to any one
what made him formidable was that a number of monks fully shared his feeling and many of the visitors looked upon him as a great saint and ascetic although they had no doubt that he was crazy
though he lived in the hermitage they did not worry him to keep its regulations and this too because he behaved as though he were crazy
he was seventy five or more and he lived in a corner beyond the apiary in an old decaying wooden cell which had been built long ago for another great ascetic father_zossima iona who had lived to be a hundred and five and of whose saintly doings many curious stories were still extant in the monastery and the neighborhood
but it was just his craziness attracted them father_zossima father_ferapont never went to see the elder father_zossima father_ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in this same solitary cell seven years previously
it was simply a peasant hut though it looked like a chapel for it contained an extraordinary number of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them which man brought to the monastery as offerings to god
father_zossima father_ferapont had been appointed to look after them and keep the lamps burning it was said and indeed it was true that he ate only two pounds of bread in three day
the beekeeper who lived close by the apiary used to bring him the bread every three day and even to this man who waited upon him father_zossima father_ferapont rarely uttered a word
the four pounds of bread together with the sacrament bread regularly sent him on sundays after the late mass by the father_zossima superior made up his weekly rations
the water in his jug was changed every day he rarely appeared at mass visitors who came to do him homage saw him sometimes kneeling all day long at prayer without looking round
on very rare occasions however he would talk to visitors but for the most part he would utter some one strange saying which was a complete riddle and no entreaty would induce him to pronounce a word in explanation
if he addressed them he was brief abrupt strange and almost always rude he was not a priest but a simple monk
there was a strange belief chiefly however among the most ignorant that father_zossima father_ferapont had communication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with them and so was silent with man
the monk from obdorsk having been directed to the apiary by the beekeeper who was also a very silent and surly monk went to the corner where father_zossima father_ferapont cell stood
maybe he will speak as you are a stranger and maybe you ll get nothing out of him the beekeeper had warned him
the monk as he related afterwards approached in the utmost apprehension it was rather late in the evening father_zossima father_ferapont was sitting at the door of his cell on a low bench
a huge old elm was lightly rustling overhead there was an evening freshness in the air the monk from obdorsk bowed down before the saint and asked his blessing
do you want me to bow down to you monk said father_zossima father_ferapont get up the monk got up
what most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his strict fasting and great age father_zossima father_ferapont still looked a vigorous old man
blessing be blessed sit beside me where have you come from he was tall held himself erect and had a thin but fresh and healthy face
in spite of his great age he was not even quite gray and still had very thick hair and a full beard both of which had once been black
there was no doubt he still had considerable strength he was of athletic build his eye were gray large and luminous but strikingly prominent
he was dressed in a peasant long reddish coat of coarse convict cloth as it used to be called and had a stout rope round his waist
he spoke with a broad accent his throat and chest were bare beneath his coat his shirt of the coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt not having been changed for months
they said that he wore irons weighing thirty pounds under his coat his stockingless feet were thrust in old slippers almost dropping to pieces
from the little obdorsk monastery from st sylvester the monk answered humbly whilst his keen and inquisitive but rather frightened little eye kept watch on the hermit
i have been at your sylvester i used to stay there is sylvester well the monk hesitated
you are a senseless lot how do you keep the fasts our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules
during lent there are no meals provided for monday wednesday and friday for tuesday and thursday we have white bread stewed fruit with honey wild berries or salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout
on saturday white cabbage soup noodles with peas kasha all with hemp oil on weekdays we have dried fish and kasha with the cabbage soup
from monday till saturday evening six whole day in holy week nothing is cooked and we have only bread and water and that sparingly if possible not taking food every day just the same as is ordered for first week in lent
in the same way on the saturday we have to fast till three clock and then take a little bread and water and drink a single cup of wine
on holy thursday we drink wine and have something cooked without oil or not cooked at all inasmuch as the laodicean council lays down for holy thursday it is unseemly by remitting the fast on the holy thursday to dishonor the whole of lent
but what is that compared with you holy father_zossima added the monk growing more confident for all the year round even at easter you take nothing but bread and water and what we should eat in two day lasts you full seven
on good friday nothing is eaten this is how we keep the fast it truly marvelous your great abstinence and mushrooms
i can give up their bread not needing it at all and go away into the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries but they cant give up their bread here wherefore they are in bondage to the devil
asked father_zossima father_ferapont suddenly mushrooms repeated the surprised monk yes nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of such fasting
haughty and unclean is their judgment och true sighed the monk and have you seen devils among them asked father_ferapont
among them among whom asked the monk timidly i went to the father_zossima superior on trinity sunday last year i havent been since
i saw a devil sitting on one man chest hiding under his cassock only his horns poked out another had one peeping out of his pocket with such sharp eye he was afraid of me another settled in the unclean belly of one another was hanging round a man neck and so he was carrying him about without seeing him
when i was coming out from the superior i saw one hiding from me behind the door and a big one a yard and a half or more high with a thick long gray tail and the tip of his tail was in the crack of the door and i was quick and slammed the door pinching his tail in it
you can see spirits the monk inquired i tell you i can see i can see through them he squealed and began to struggle and i made the sign of the cross over him three time
and he died on the spot like a crushed spider he must have rotted there in the corner and be stinking but they dont see they dont smell it
it a year since i have been there i reveal it to you as you are a stranger your words are terrible
but holy and blessed father_zossima said the monk growing bolder and bolder is it true as they noise abroad even to distant land about you that you are in continual communication with the holy ghost
he does fly down at time how does he fly down in what form as a bird the holy ghost in the form of a dove
there the holy ghost and there the holy spirit the holy spirit can appear as other birds sometimes as a swallow sometimes a goldfinch and sometimes as a blue tit
how do you know him from an ordinary tit he speaks how does he speak in what language human language
and what does he tell you why to day he told me that a fool would visit me and would ask me unseemly questions
you want to know too much monk terrible are your words most holy and blessed father_zossima the monk shook his head
but there was a doubtful look in his frightened little eye do you see this tree asked father_zossima father_ferapont after a pause
i do blessed father_zossima you think it an elm but for me it has another shape what sort of shape
in the night it is church_of_christ holding out his arms to me and seeking me with those arms i see it clearly and tremble
inquired the monk after a pause of vain expectation it happens at night you see those two branches it terrible terrible
what is there terrible if it church_of_christ himself why he ll snatch me up and carry me away alive in the spirit and glory of elijah havent you heard
though the monk returned to the cell he was sharing with one of the brothers in considerable perplexity of mind he still cherished at heart a greater reverence for father_zossima father_ferapont than for father_zossima
he was strongly in favor of fasting and it was not strange that one who kept so rigid a fast as father_zossima father_ferapont should see marvels
his words seemed certainly queer but god only could tell what was hidden in those words and were not worse words and acts commonly seen in those who have sacrificed their intellects for the glory of god
he will take me in his arms and bear me away the pinching of the devil tail he was ready and eager to believe and not only in the figurative sense
besides he had before visiting the monastery a strong prejudice against the institution of elders which he only knew of by hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation
before he had been long at the monastery he had detected the secret murmurings of some shallow brothers who disliked the institution
he was besides a meddlesome inquisitive man who poked his nose into everything this was why the news of the fresh miracle performed by father_zossima reduced him to extreme perplexity
alyosha_karamazov remembered afterwards how their inquisitive guest from obdorsk had been continually flitting to and fro from one group to another listening and asking questions among the monks that were crowding within and without the elder cell
he had no thought to spare for it indeed for when father_zossima feeling tired again had gone back to bed he thought of alyosha_karamazov as he was closing his eye and sent for him
but he did not pay much attention to him at the time and only recollected it afterwards alyosha_karamazov ran at once
the elder opening his weary eye and looking intently at alyosha_karamazov asked him suddenly are your people expecting you my son
there was no one else in the cell but father_zossima father_paďssy father_zossima iosif and the novice porfiry alyosha_karamazov hesitated havent they need of you
didnt you promise some one yesterday to see them to day i did promise to my father_zossima my brothers others too you see you must go
dont grieve be sure i shall not die without your being by to hear my last word to you i will say that word my son it will be my last gift to you
to you dear son because you love me but now go to keep your promise alyosha_karamazov immediately obeyed though it was hard to go
but the promise that he should hear his last word on earth that it should be the last gift to him alyosha_karamazov sent a thrill of rapture through his soul
he made haste that he might finish what he had to do in the town and return quickly father_zossima father_paďssy too uttered some words of exhortation which moved and surprised him greatly
remember young man unceasingly father_zossima father_paďssy began without preface that the science of this world which has become a great power has especially in the last century analyzed everything divine handed down to us in the holy book
he spoke as they left the cell together after this cruel analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that was sacred of old
but they have only analyzed the parts and overlooked the whole and indeed their blindness is marvelous yet the whole still stands steadfast before their eye and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
has it not lasted nineteen centuries is it not still a living a moving power in the individual soul and in the masses of people
for even those who have renounced christianity and attack it in their inmost being still follow the christian ideal for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue than the ideal given by church_of_christ of old
it is still as strong and living even in the soul of atheists who have destroyed everything when it has been attempted the result has been only grotesque
maybe remembering this great day you will not forget my words uttered from the heart for your guidance seeing you are young and the temptations of the world are great and beyond your strength to endure
remember this especially young man since you are being sent into the world by your departing elder well now go my orphan
as alyosha_karamazov left the monastery and thought them over he suddenly realized that he had met a new and unexpected friend a warmly loving teacher in this austere monk who had hitherto treated him sternly
it was as though father_zossima had bequeathed him to him at his death and perhaps that just what had passed between them alyosha_karamazov thought suddenly
with these words father_zossima father_paďssy blessed him the philosophic reflections he had just heard so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of father_zossima father_paďssy heart
he was in haste to arm the boy mind for conflict with temptation and to guard the young soul left in his charge with the strongest defense he could imagine
on the way he remembered that his father_zossima had insisted the day before that he should come without his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov seeing him
chapter ii at his father_zossima first of all alyosha_karamazov went to his father_zossima why so alyosha_karamazov wondered suddenly
even if my father_zossima has something to say to me alone why should i go in unseen most likely in his excitement yesterday he meant to say something different he decided
yet he was very glad when marfa_ignatyevna who opened the garden gate to him grigory_vassilyevitch it appeared was ill in bed in the lodge told him in answer to his question that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had gone out two hours ago
and my father_zossima he is up taking his coffee marfa answered somewhat dryly alyosha_karamazov went in the old man was sitting alone at the table wearing slippers and a little old overcoat
he was amusing himself by looking through some accounts rather inattentively however he was quite alone in the house for smerdyakov too had gone out marketing
though he had got up early and was trying to put a bold face on it he looked tired and weak
his forehead upon which huge purple bruises had come out during the night was bandaged with a red handkerchief his nose too had swollen terribly in the night and some smaller bruises covered it in patches giving his whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look
the old man was aware of this and turned a hostile glance on alyosha_karamazov as he came in the coffee is cold he cried harshly i wont offer you any
i ve ordered nothing but a lenten fish soup to day and i dont invite any one to share it why have you come
to find out how you are said alyosha_karamazov yes besides i told you to come yesterday it all of no consequence
you need not have troubled but i knew you come poking in directly he said this with almost hostile feeling
at the same time he got up and looked anxiously in the looking glass perhaps for the fortieth time that morning at his nose
he began too binding his red handkerchief more becomingly on his forehead red better it just like the hospital in a white one he observed sententiously
well how are things over there how is your elder he is very bad he may die to day answered alyosha_karamazov
but his father_zossima had not listened and had forgotten his own question at once ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov gone out he said suddenly
he is doing his utmost to carry off mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov betrothed that what he is staying here for he added maliciously and twisting his mouth looked at alyosha_karamazov
surely he did not tell you so asked alyosha_karamazov yes he did long ago would you believe it he told me three weeks ago
you dont suppose he too came to murder me do you he must have had some object in coming
what do you mean why do you say such things said alyosha_karamazov troubled he doesnt ask for money it true but yet he wont get a farthing from me
i intend living as long as possible you may as well know my dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and so i need every farthing and
the longer i live the more i shall need it he continued pacing from one corner of the room to the other keeping his hands in the pockets of his loose greasy overcoat made of yellow cotton material
i can still pass for a man at five and fifty but i want to pass for one for another twenty years
as i get older you know i shant be a pretty object the wenches wont come to me of their own accord so i shall want my money
so i am saving up more and more simply for myself my dear son alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you may as well know
for sin is sweet all abuse it but all man live in it only others do it on the sly and i openly
for i mean to go on in my sins to the end let me tell you and so all the other sinners fall upon me for being so simple
and your paradise alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is not to my taste let me tell you that and it not the proper place for a gentleman your paradise even if it exists
i believe that i fall asleep and dont wake up again and that all you can pray for my soul if you like
and if you dont want to dont damn you that my philosophy ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov talked well here yesterday though we were all drunk
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is a conceited coxcomb but he has no particular learning nor education either he sits silent and smiles at one without speaking that what pulls him through
alyosha_karamazov listened to him in silence why wont he talk to me if he does speak he gives himself airs
your ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is a scoundrel and i ll marry grushenka in a minute if i want to for if you ve money alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you have only to want a thing
that what ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is afraid of he is on the watch to prevent me getting married and that why he is egging on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to marry grushenka himself
he hopes to keep me from grushenka by that as though i should leave him my money if i dont marry her
and you can have it besides if mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov marries grushenka ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov will carry off his rich betrothed that what he reckoning on
he is a scoundrel your ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how cross you are it because of yesterday you had better lie down said alyosha_karamazov
you say that the old man observed suddenly as though it had struck him for the first time and i am not angry with you
there but if ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said it i should be angry with him it is only with you i have good moments
else you know i am an ill natured man you are not ill natured but distorted said alyosha_karamazov with a smile
listen i meant this morning to get that ruffian mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov locked up and i dont know now what i shall decide about it
of course in these fashionable day fathers and mothers are looked upon as a prejudice but even now the law does not allow you to drag your old father_zossima about by the hair to kick him in the face in his own house and brag of murdering him outright all in the presence of witnesses
if i liked i could crush him and could have him locked up at once for what he did yesterday then you dont mean to take proceedings
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has dissuaded me i shouldnt care about ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but there another thing and bending down to alyosha_karamazov he went on in a confidential half whisper
but if she hears that he has beaten me a weak old man within an inch of my life she may give him up and come to me
if i send the ruffian to prison she ll hear of it and run to see him at once for that her way
everything by contraries i know her through and through wont you have a drop of brandy take some cold coffee and i ll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy into it
i ll take that roll with me if i may said alyosha_karamazov and taking a halfpenny french roll he put it in the pocket of his cassock
it delicious my boy no thank you and you better not have brandy either he suggested apprehensively looking into the old man face
you are quite right it irritates my nerves instead of soothing them only one little glass i ll get it out of the cupboard
he unlocked the cupboard poured out a glass drank it then locked the cupboard and put the key back in his pocket
that enough one glass wont kill me you see you are in a better humor now said alyosha_karamazov smiling
um i love you even without the brandy but with scoundrels i am a scoundrel ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is not going to tchermashnya why is that
he wants to spy how much i give grushenka if she comes they are all scoundrels but i dont recognize ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i dont know him at all
where does he come from he is not one of us in soul as though i leave him anything i shant leave a will at all you may as well know
and i ll crush mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov like a beetle i squash black beetles at night with my slipper they squelch when you tread on them
and your mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov will squelch too your mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov for you love him yes you love him and i am not afraid of your loving him
but if ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov loved him i should be afraid for myself at his loving him but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov loves nobody ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is not one of us
people like ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov are not our sort my boy they are like a cloud of dust when the wind blows the dust will be gone
i had a silly idea in my head when i told you to come to day i wanted to find out from you about mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
if i were to hand him over a thousand or maybe two now would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself off altogether for five years or better still thirty five and without grushenka and give her up once for all eh
i i ll ask him muttered alyosha_karamazov if you would give him three thousand perhaps he that nonsense you neednt ask him now no need
i ve changed my mind it was a nonsensical idea of mine i wont give him anything not a penny i want my money myself cried the old man waving his hand
i ll crush him like a beetle without it dont say anything to him or else he will begin hoping there nothing for you to do here you neednt stay
is that betrothed of his katerina_ivanovna whom he has kept so carefully hidden from me all this time going to marry him or
not you went to see her yesterday i believe nothing will induce her to abandon him there you see how dearly these fine young lady love a rake and a scoundrel
ah if i had his youth and the looks i had then for i was better looking than he at eight and twenty
they are poor creatures i tell you those pale young lady very different from i have been a conquering hero just as he is
he is a low cad but he shant have grushenka anyway he shant i ll crush him his anger had returned with the last words
you can go there nothing for you to do here to day he snapped harshly alyosha_karamazov went up to say good by to him and kissed him on the shoulder
what that for the old man was a little surprised we shall see each other again or do you think we shant
not at all i didnt mean anything nor did i i did not mean anything said the old man looking at him
listen listen he shouted after him make haste and come again and i ll have a fish soup for you a fine one not like to day
and as soon as alyosha_karamazov had gone out of the door he went to the cupboard again and poured out another half glass
be sure to come come to morrow do you hear to morrow i wont have more he muttered clearing his throat and again he locked the cupboard and put the key in his pocket
then he went into his bedroom lay down on the bed exhausted and in one minute he was asleep chapter iii
thank goodness he did not ask me about grushenka thought alyosha_karamazov as he left his father_zossima house and turned towards madame_hohlakov or i might have to tell him of my meeting with grushenka yesterday
a meeting with the schoolboys alyosha_karamazov felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewed their energies and that their hearts had grown hard again
he too will be harder than yesterday he too must be spiteful and angry and he too no doubt has made some plan
father_zossima is spiteful and angry he made some plan and will stick to it and what of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov oh i must succeed in finding him to day whatever happens
but alyosha_karamazov had not long to meditate an incident occurred on the road which though apparently of little consequence made a great impression on him
just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner coming out into mihailovsky street which is divided by a small ditch from the high street our whole town is intersected by ditches he saw a group of schoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve at the bridge
they were going home from school some with their bags on their shoulders others with leather satchels slung across them some in short jackets others in little overcoats
some even had those high boots with creases round the ankles such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear
alyosha_karamazov had never from his moscow day been able to pass child without taking notice of them and although he was particularly fond of child of three or thereabout he liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too
the whole group was talking eagerly about something apparently holding a council and so anxious as he was to day he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them
he looked into their excited rosy faces and noticed at once that all the boys had stones in their hands behind the ditch some thirty paces away there was another schoolboy standing by a fence
he too had a satchel at his side he was about ten years old pale delicate looking and with sparkling black eye
he kept an attentive and anxious watch on the other six obviously his schoolfellows with whom he had just come out of school but with whom he had evidently had a feud
alyosha_karamazov went up and addressing a fair curly headed rosy boy in a black jacket observed when i used to wear a satchel like yours i always used to carry it on my left side so as to have my right hand free but you ve got yours on your right side
so it will be awkward for you to get at it alyosha_karamazov had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical remark
but it is the only way for a grown up person to get at once into confidential relations with a child or still more with a group of child
one must begin in a serious businesslike way so as to be on a perfectly equal footing alyosha_karamazov understood it by instinct
but he is left handed another a fine healthy looking boy of eleven answered promptly all the others stared at alyosha_karamazov
at that instant a stone flew into the group but only just grazed the left handed boy though it was well and vigorously thrown by the boy standing the other side of the ditch
he even throws stones with his left hand observed a third give it him hit him back smurov they all shouted
but smurov the left handed boy needed no telling and at once revenged himself he threw a stone but it missed the boy and hit the ground
the boy the other side of the ditch the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones flung another stone at the group this time it flew straight at alyosha_karamazov and hit him painfully on the shoulder
he aimed it at you he meant it for you you are alyosha_karamazov karamazov the boys shouted laughing come all throw at him at once and six stones flew at the boy
one struck the boy on the head and he fell down but at once leapt up and began ferociously returning their fire
both sides threw stones incessantly many of the group had their pockets full too what are you about arent you ashamed
six against one why you ll kill him cried alyosha_karamazov he ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy
three or four ceased throwing for a minute he began first cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish voice
he is a beast he stabbed kolya_krassotkin in class the other day with a penknife it bled kolya_krassotkin wouldnt tell tales but he must be thrashed
but what for i suppose you tease him there he sent a stone in your back again he knows you cried the child
it you he is throwing at now not us come all of you at him again dont miss smurov and again a fire of stones and a very vicious one began
the boy the other side of the ditch was hit in the chest he screamed began to cry and ran away uphill towards mihailovsky street
they all shouted aha he is funking he is running away wisp of tow you dont know what a beast he is
alyosha_karamazov killing is too good for him said the boy in the jacket with flashing eye he seemed to be the eldest
what wrong with him asked alyosha_karamazov is he a tell tale or what the boys looked at one another as though derisively
are you going that way to mihailovsky the same boy went on catch him up you see he stopped again he is waiting and looking at you
he is looking at you the other boys chimed in you ask him does he like a disheveled wisp of tow
do you hear ask him that there was a general burst of laughter alyosha_karamazov looked at them and they at him
dont go near him he ll hurt you cried smurov in a warning voice i shant ask him about the wisp of tow for i expect you tease him with that question somehow
but i ll find out from him why you hate him so find out then find out cried the boys laughing alyosha_karamazov crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence straight towards the boy
you better look out the boys called after him he wont be afraid of you he will stab you in a minute on the sly as he did kolya_krassotkin
the boy waited for him without budging coming up to him alyosha_karamazov saw facing him a child of about nine years old
he was an undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face with large dark eye that gazed at him vindictively he was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat which he had monstrously outgrown
there was a large patch on the right knee of his trousers and in his right boot just at the toe there was a big hole in the leather carefully blackened with ink
his bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves both the pockets of his great coat were weighed down with stones alyosha_karamazov stopped two steps in front of him looking inquiringly at him
the boy seeing at once from alyosha_karamazov eye that he wouldnt beat him became less defiant and addressed him first
i am alone and there are six of them i ll beat them all alone he said suddenly with flashing eye
i think one of the stones must have hurt you badly observed alyosha_karamazov but i hit smurov on the head cried the boy
they told me that you know me and that you threw a stone at me on purpose said alyosha_karamazov the boy looked darkly at him
the boy cried irritably but he did not move as though he were expecting something and again there was a vindictive light in his eye
i dont know you do you know me alyosha_karamazov continued let me alone very well i am going said alyosha_karamazov only i dont know you
monk in silk trousers cried the boy following alyosha_karamazov with the same vindictive and defiant expression and he threw himself into an attitude of defense feeling sure that now alyosha_karamazov would fall upon him but alyosha_karamazov turned looked at him and walked away
he had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back
and i dont tease you they told me how they tease you but i dont want to tease you good by
so you ll hit a man from behind they tell the truth then when they say that you attack on the sly said alyosha_karamazov turning round again
this time the boy threw a stone savagely right into alyosha_karamazov face but alyosha_karamazov just had time to guard himself and the stone struck him on the elbow
arent you ashamed what have i done to you he cried the boy waited in silent defiance certain that now alyosha_karamazov would attack him
seeing that even now he would not his rage was like a little wild beast he flew at alyosha_karamazov himself and before alyosha_karamazov had time to move the spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of his and bit his middle finger
he fixed his teeth in it and it was ten second before he let go alyosha_karamazov cried out with pain and pulled his finger away with all his might
the child let go at last and retreated to his former distance alyosha_karamazov finger had been badly bitten to the bone close to the nail it began to bleed
alyosha_karamazov took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly round his injured hand he was a full minute bandaging it the boy stood waiting all the time
at last alyosha_karamazov raised his gentle eye and looked at him very well he said you see how badly you ve bitten me
that enough isnt it now tell me what have i done to you the boy stared in amazement though i dont know you
alyosha_karamazov went on with the same serenity yet i must have done something to you you wouldnt have hurt me like this for nothing
and it the first time i ve seen you so what have i done how have i wronged you tell me
alyosha_karamazov walked slowly after him towards mihailovsky street and for a long time he saw the child running in the distance as fast as ever not turning his head and no doubt still keeping up his tearful wail
instead of answering the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and ran away he made up his mind to find him out as soon as he had time and to solve this mystery
at the hohlakovs alyosha_karamazov soon reached madame_hohlakov house a handsome stone house of two stories one of the finest in our town
though madame_hohlakov spent most of her time in another province where she had an estate or in moscow where she had a house of her own yet she had a house in our town too inherited from her forefathers
the estate in our district was the largest of her three estates yet she had been very little in our province before this time
just now he had not the time chapter iv she ran out to alyosha_karamazov in the hall did you get my letter about the new miracle
she spoke rapidly and nervously yes did you show it to every one he restored the son to his mother
he is dying to day said alyosha_karamazov i have heard i know oh how i long to talk to you to you or some one about all this
no to you to you and how sorry i am i cant see him the whole town is in excitement they are all suspense
but now do you know katerina_ivanovna is here now ah that lucky cried alyosha_karamazov then i shall see her here
she told me yesterday to be sure to come and see her to day i know i know all i ve heard exactly what happened yesterday and the atrocious behavior of that creature
c est tragique and if i been in her place i dont know what i should have done and your brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov what do you think of him my goodness
alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i am forgetting only fancy your brother is in there with her not that dreadful brother who was so shocking yesterday but the other ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he is sitting with her talking they are having a serious conversation
if you could only imagine what passing between them now it awful i tell you it lacerating it like some incredible tale of horror
they are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see they both recognize it and revel in it i ve been watching for you
i ve been thirsting for you it too much for me that the worst of it i ll tell you all about it presently but now i must speak of something else the most important thing
i had quite forgotten what most important tell me why has lise been in hysterics as soon as she heard you were here she began to be hysterical
maman it you who are hysterical now not i lise voice caroled through a tiny crack of the door at the side
her voice sounded as though she wanted to laugh but was doing her utmost to control it alyosha_karamazov at once noticed the crack and no doubt lise was peeping through it but that he could not see
and no wonder lise no wonder your caprices will make me hysterical too but she is so ill alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
she has been so ill all night feverish and moaning i could hardly wait for the morning and for herzenstube to come
he says that he can make nothing of it that we must wait herzenstube always comes and says that he can make nothing of it
as soon as you approached the house she screamed fell into hysterics and insisted on being wheeled back into this room here
mamma i didnt know he had come it wasnt on his account i wanted to be wheeled into this room
that not true lise yulia ran to tell you that alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was coming she was on the look out for you
but if you want to make up for it and say something very clever dear mamma you better tell our honored visitor alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that he has shown his want of wit by venturing to us after what happened yesterday and although every one is laughing at him
my darling mamma it not at all clever of you lise you go too far i declare i shall have to be severe
who laughs at him i am so glad he has come i need him i cant do without him oh alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i am exceedingly unhappy
ah your caprices lise your fidgetiness your illness that awful night of fever that awful everlasting herzenstube everlasting everlasting that the worst of it
but what the matter with you mamma darling everything in fact everything even that miracle too oh how it has upset me how it has shattered me that miracle dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
and that tragedy in the drawing room it more than i can bear i warn you i cant bear it a comedy perhaps not a tragedy
tell me will father_zossima live till to morrow will he oh my god what is happening to me every minute i close my eye and see that it all nonsense
i should be very grateful alyosha_karamazov interrupted suddenly if you could give me a clean rag to bind up my finger with
all nonsense i have hurt it and it very painful alyosha_karamazov unbound his bitten finger the handkerchief was soaked with blood
madame_hohlakov screamed and shut her eye good heavens what a wound how awful but as soon as lise saw alyosha_karamazov finger through the crack she flung the door wide open
come come here she cried imperiously no nonsense now good heavens why did you stand there saying nothing about it all this time
you must wash it first of all simply hold it in cold water to stop the pain and keep it there keep it there
he might have bled to death mamma how did you do it water water make haste mamma some water in a slop basin
but do make haste she finished nervously she was quite frightened at the sight of alyosha_karamazov wound shouldnt we send for herzenstube
cried madame_hohlakov mamma you ll be the death of me your herzenstube will come and say that he can make nothing of it
water water mamma for goodness sake go yourself and hurry yulia she is such a slowcoach and never can come quickly
make haste mamma or i shall die why it nothing much cried alyosha_karamazov frightened at this alarm yulia ran in with water and alyosha_karamazov put his finger in it
some lint mamma for mercy sake bring some lint and that muddy caustic lotion for wounds what it called we ve got some
you know where the bottle is mamma it in your bedroom in the right hand cupboard there a big bottle of it there with the lint
i ll bring everything in a minute lise only dont scream and dont fuss you see how bravely alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov bears it
where did you get such a dreadful wound alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov madame_hohlakov hastened away this was all lise was waiting for
first of all answer the question where did you get hurt like this she asked alyosha_karamazov quickly and then i ll talk to you about something quite different
instinctively feeling that the time of her mother absence was precious for her alyosha_karamazov hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with the schoolboys in the fewest words possible
well lise clasped her hands at his story how can you and in that dress too associate with schoolboys
she cried angrily as though she had a right to control him you are nothing but a boy yourself if you can do that a perfect boy
but you must find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it for there some mystery in it
now for the second thing but first a question does the pain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant things but talking sensibly
of course not and i dont feel much pain now that because your finger is in the water it must be changed directly for it will get warm in a minute
i can speak will you give me the letter i sent you yesterday dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov be quick for mamma will be back in a minute
yulia bring some ice from the cellar and another basin of water now she is gone and i dont want i havent got the letter
that not true you have i knew you would say that you ve got it in that pocket i ve been regretting that joke all night
give me back the letter at once give it me i ve left it at home but you cant consider me as a child a little girl after that silly joke
i beg your pardon for that silliness but you must bring me the letter if you really havent got it bring it to day you must you must
to day i cant possibly for i am going back to the monastery and i shant come and see you for the next two day three or four perhaps for father_zossima
four day what nonsense listen did you laugh at me very much i didnt laugh at all why not
as soon as i read it i thought that all that would come to pass for as soon as father_zossima dies i am to leave the monastery
because i believed all you said you are insulting me not at all then i shall go back and finish my study and when you reach the legal age we will be married
though i havent had time to think about it i believe i couldnt find a better wife than you and father_zossima tells me i must marry
i shall love you but i am a cripple wheeled about in a chair laughed lise flushing crimson i ll wheel you about myself but i sure you ll get well by then
but you are mad said lise nervously to make all this nonsense out of a joke here mamma very propos perhaps
mamma how slow you always are how can you be so long and here yulia with the ice oh lise dont scream above all things dont scream
that scream drives me how can i help it when you put the lint in another place i ve been hunting and hunting i do believe you did it on purpose
but i couldnt tell that he would come with a bad finger or else perhaps i might have done it on purpose
my darling mamma you begin to say really witty things never mind my being witty but i must say you show nice feeling for alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov sufferings
oh my dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov what killing me is no one thing in particular not herzenstube but everything together that what is too much for me
that enough mamma enough about herzenstube lise laughed gayly make haste with the lint and the lotion mamma that simply goulard water alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i remember the name now but it a splendid lotion
would you believe it mamma on the way here he had a fight with the boys in the street and it was a boy bit his finger isnt he a child a child himself
is he fit to be married after that for only fancy he wants to be married mamma just think of him married wouldnt it be funny wouldnt it be awful
and lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle looking slyly at alyosha_karamazov but why married lise what makes you talk of such a thing
it quite out of place and perhaps the boy was rabid why mamma as though there were rabid boys why not lise as though i had said something stupid
your boy might have been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite any one near him
how well she has bandaged it alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i couldnt have done it do you still feel the pain it nothing much now
perhaps i really was rather too quick talking of the boy being rabid and you pounced upon it at once katerina_ivanovna has only just heard that you are here alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov she simply rushed at me she dying to see you dying
you dont feel afraid of water asked lise come that enough lise ach mamma go to them yourself he cant go just now he is in too much pain
not at all i can go quite well said alyosha_karamazov what you are going away is that what you say
but i should like to see katerina_ivanovna at once for i am very anxious to be back at the monastery as soon as i can
well when i ve seen them i ll come back here and we can talk as much as you like mamma take him away quickly
alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dont trouble to come and see me afterwards but go straight back to your monastery and a good riddance
i want to sleep i didnt sleep all night ah lise you are only making fun but how i wish you would sleep cried madame_hohlakov
i dont know what i ve done i ll stay another three minutes five if you like muttered alyosha_karamazov even five
do take him away quickly mamma he is a monster lise you are crazy let us go alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov she is too capricious to day
i am afraid to cross her oh the trouble one has with nervous girls perhaps she really will be able to sleep after seeing you
how quickly you have made her sleepy and how fortunate it is ah mamma how sweetly you talk i must kiss you for it mamma
and i kiss you too lise listen alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov madame_hohlakov began mysteriously and importantly speaking in a rapid whisper
i dont want to suggest anything i dont want to lift the veil you will see for yourself what going on
it appalling it the most fantastic farce she loves your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and she is doing her utmost to persuade herself
she loves your brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov it appalling i ll go in with you and if they dont turn me out i ll stay to the end
chapter a laceration in the drawing room but in the drawing room the conversation was already over katerina_ivanovna was greatly excited though she looked resolute
at the moment alyosha_karamazov and madame_hohlakov entered ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stood up to take leave his face was rather pale and alyosha_karamazov looked at him anxiously
during the preceding month it had been several time suggested to him that his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was in love with katerina_ivanovna and what was more that he meant to carry her off from dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
for this moment was to solve a doubt a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted alyosha_karamazov until quite lately the idea seemed to alyosha_karamazov monstrous though it worried him extremely
meantime dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was his rival and that it was a great assistance to him dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
he loved both his brothers and dreaded such rivalry between them in what way did it assist him to marry grushenka
besides all this alyosha_karamazov had till the evening before implicitly believed that katerina_ivanovna had a steadfast and passionate love for dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov but he had only believed it till the evening before
he had fancied too that she was incapable of loving a man like ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and that she did love dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and loved him just as he was in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion
the word lacerating which madame_hohlakov had just uttered almost made him start because half waking up towards daybreak that night he had cried out laceration laceration probably applying it to his dream
but that alyosha_karamazov considered the worst thing possible but during yesterday scene with grushenka another idea had struck him he had been dreaming all night of the previous day scene at katerina_ivanovna
now alyosha_karamazov was impressed by madame_hohlakov blunt and persistent assertion that katerina_ivanovna was in love with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and only deceived herself through some sort of pose from self laceration and tortured herself by her pretended love for dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov from some fancied duty of gratitude
yes he thought perhaps the whole truth lies in those words but in that case what was ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov position
alyosha_karamazov felt instinctively that a character like katerina_ivanovna must dominate and she could only dominate some one like dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and never a man like ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
for dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov might at last submit to her domination to his own happiness which was what alyosha_karamazov would have desired but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov no ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov could not submit to her and such submission would not give him happiness
alyosha_karamazov could not help believing that of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and now all these doubts and reflections flitted through his mind as he entered the drawing room
it must be noted that alyosha_karamazov felt as it were ashamed of his own thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during the last month
another idea too forced itself upon him what if she loved neither of them neither ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nor dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov what do i know about love and women and how can i decide such questions
he felt instinctively that this rivalry was of immense importance in his brothers lives and that a great deal depended upon it
he thought reproachfully after such doubts and surmises and yet it was impossible not to think about it one reptile will devour the other ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had pronounced the day before speaking in anger of his father_zossima and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
so ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov looked upon dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov as a reptile and perhaps had long done so was it perhaps since he had known katerina_ivanovna
that phrase had of course escaped ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov unawares yesterday but that only made it more important if he felt like that what chance was there of peace
were there not on the contrary new grounds for hatred and hostility in their family and with which of them was alyosha_karamazov to sympathize
and what was he to wish for each of them he loved them both but what could he desire for each in the midst of these conflicting interests
he might go quite astray in this maze and alyosha_karamazov heart could not endure uncertainty because his love was always of an active character
and to do so he must know what he was aiming at he must know for certain what was best for each and having ascertained this it was natural for him to help them both
he was incapable of passive love if he loved any one he set to work at once to help him but instead of a definite aim he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all sides
it was lacerating as was said just now but what could he understand even in this laceration he did not understand the first word in this perplexing maze
seeing alyosha_karamazov katerina_ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov who had already got up to go a minute stay another minute
i want to hear the opinion of this person here whom i trust absolutely dont go away she added addressing madame_hohlakov
you are all my friends here all i have in the world my dear friends she began warmly in a voice which quivered with genuine tears of suffering and alyosha_karamazov heart warmed to her at once
she made alyosha_karamazov sit down beside her and madame_hohlakov sat opposite by ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov were witness yesterday of that abominable scene and saw what i did
i only know one thing that if it were repeated to day this minute i should express the same feeling again as yesterday the same feeling the same words the same actions
you did not see it ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he did what he thought of me yesterday i dont know you remember my actions alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you checked me in one of them
as she said that she flushed and her eye shone i must tell you that i cant get over it
listen alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i dont even know whether i still love him i feel pity for him and that is a poor sign of love
if i loved him if i still loved him perhaps i shouldnt be sorry for him now but should hate him
her voice quivered and tears glittered on her eyelashes alyosha_karamazov shuddered inwardly that girl is truthful and sincere he thought and she does not love dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov any more
that true that true cried madame_hohlakov wait dear i havent told you the chief the final decision i came to during the night
i feel that perhaps my decision is a terrible one for me but i foresee that nothing will induce me to change it nothing
my dear kind ever faithful and generous adviser the one friend i have in the world ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with his deep insight into the heart approves and commends my decision
it will be so all my life he knows it yes i approve of it ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov assented in a subdued but firm voice
alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov forgive my calling you simply alyosha_karamazov i should like alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov too to tell me before my two friends whether i am right
i feel instinctively that you alyosha_karamazov my dear brother for you are a dear brother to me she said again ecstatically taking his cold hand in her hot one i foresee that your decision your approval will bring me peace in spite of all my sufferings for after your words i shall be calm and submit i feel that
but i should like alyosha_karamazov too ah i dont know what you are asking me said alyosha_karamazov flushing i only know that i love you and at this moment wish for your happiness more than my own
but i know nothing about such affairs something impelled him to add hurriedly in such affairs alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in such affairs the chief thing is honor and duty and something higher
i dont know what but higher perhaps even than duty i am conscious of this irresistible feeling in my heart and it compels me irresistibly
but it may all be put in two words i ve already decided even if he marries that creature she began solemnly whom i never never can forgive
even then i will not abandon him henceforward i will never never abandon him she cried breaking into a sort of pale hysterical ecstasy
i will go away to another town where you like but i will watch over him all my life i will watch over him all my life unceasingly
when he becomes unhappy with that woman and that is bound to happen quite soon let him come to me and he will find a friend a sister
only a sister of course and so for ever but he will learn at least that that sister is really his sister who loves him and has sacrificed all her life to him
not that i would run after him continually get in his way and worry him oh no i will gain my point
i will insist on his knowing me and confiding entirely in me without reserve she cried in a sort of frenzy
i will be a god to whom he can pray and that at least he owes me for his treachery and for what i suffered yesterday through him
and let him see that all my life i will be true to him and the promise i gave him in spite of his being untrue and betraying me
how shall i say an instrument a machine for his happiness and that for my whole life my whole life and that he may see that all his life
i will i will become nothing but a means for his happiness or that my decision ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov fully approves me
she had perhaps intended to express her idea with more dignity art and naturalness but her speech was too hurried and crude
it was full of youthful impulsiveness it betrayed that she was still smarting from yesterday insult and that her pride craved satisfaction
she was breathless she felt this herself her face suddenly darkened an unpleasant look came into her eye alyosha_karamazov at once saw it and felt a pang of sympathy
his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov made it worse by adding i ve only expressed my own view he said from any one else this would have been affected and overstrained but from you no
any other woman would have been wrong but you are right i dont know how to explain it but i see that you are absolutely genuine and therefore you are right
but that only for the moment and what does this moment stand for nothing but yesterday insult madame_hohlakov obviously had not intended to interfere but she could not refrain from this very just comment
quite so quite so cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with peculiar eagerness obviously annoyed at being interrupted in any one else this moment would be only due to yesterday impression and would be only a moment
what for any one else would be only a promise is for her an everlasting burdensome grim perhaps but unflagging duty
but with katerina_ivanovna character that moment will last all her life and she will be sustained by the feeling of this duty being fulfilled
your life katerina_ivanovna will henceforth be spent in painful brooding over your own feeling your own heroism and your own suffering but in the end that suffering will be softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment of a bold and proud design
and the consciousness of it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything else
this was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with intention even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he spoke ironically and with intention
yes proud it certainly is and desperate in any case but a triumph for you oh dear how mistaken it all is
madame_hohlakov cried again alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you speak i want dreadfully to know what you will say cried katerina_ivanovna and burst into tears
alyosha_karamazov got up from the sofa it nothing nothing she went on through her tears i upset i didnt sleep last night
but by the side of two such friends as you and your brother i still feel strong for i know you two will never desert me
unluckily i am obliged to return to moscow perhaps to morrow and to leave you for a long time and unluckily it unavoidable ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said suddenly
to morrow to moscow her face was suddenly contorted but but dear me how fortunate she cried in a voice suddenly changed
instead of a poor insulted girl weeping in a sort of laceration he saw a woman completely self possessed and even exceedingly pleased as though something agreeable had just happened
in one instant there was no trace left of her tears she underwent an instantaneous transformation which amazed alyosha_karamazov oh not fortunate that i am losing you of course not she corrected herself suddenly with a charming society smile
such a friend as you are could not suppose that i am only too unhappy at losing you she rushed impulsively at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and seizing both his hands pressed them warmly
but what is fortunate is that you will be able in moscow to see auntie and agafya_ivanovna and to tell them all the horror of my present position
you cant think how wretched i was yesterday and this morning wondering how i could write them that dreadful letter for one can never tell such things in a letter
you can speak with complete openness to agafya_ivanovna but spare dear auntie you will know how to do that now it will be easy for me to write for you will see them and explain everything
oh how glad i am but i am only glad of that believe me of course no one can take your place
i will run at once to write the letter she finished suddenly and took a step as though to go out of the room
and what about alyosha_karamazov and his opinion which you were so desperately anxious to hear cried madame_hohlakov there was a sarcastic angry note in her voice
i had not forgotten that cried katerina_ivanovna coming to a sudden standstill and why are you so antagonistic at such a moment
she added with warm and bitter reproachfulness what i said i repeat i must have his opinion more than that i must have his decision
as he says so it shall be you see how anxious i am for your words alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but what the matter
i couldnt have believed it i cant understand it alyosha_karamazov cried suddenly in distress what what he is going to moscow and you cry out that you are glad
you said that on purpose and you begin explaining that you are not glad of that but sorry to be losing a friend
but that was acting too you were playing a part as in a theater in a theater what what do you mean exclaimed katerina_ivanovna profoundly astonished flushing crimson and frowning
though you assure him you are sorry to lose a friend in him you persist in telling him to his face that it fortunate he is going said alyosha_karamazov breathlessly
he was standing at the table and did not sit down what are you talking about i dont understand
i know i am not saying it properly but i ll say it all the same alyosha_karamazov went on in the same shaking and broken voice
i dont understand myself i seemed to see in a flash what i see is that perhaps you dont love dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov at all and never have from the beginning
i really dont know how i dare to say all this but somebody must tell the truth for nobody here will tell the truth
and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov too has never loved you and only esteems you what truth cried katerina_ivanovna and there was an hysterical ring in her voice
i ll tell you alyosha_karamazov went on with desperate haste as though he were jumping from the top of a house
call dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov i will fetch him and let him come here and take your hand and take ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and join your hands
for you re torturing ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov simply because you love him and torturing him because you love dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov through self laceration with an unreal love because you ve persuaded yourself
alyosha_karamazov broke off and was silent you you you are a little religious idiot that what you are
katerina_ivanovna snapped her face was white and her lips were moving with anger ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly laughed and got up his hat was in his hand
you are mistaken my good alyosha_karamazov he said with an expression alyosha_karamazov had never seen in his face before an expression of youthful sincerity and strong irresistibly frank feeling
she has known all the time that i cared for her though i never said a word of my love to her she knew
katerina_ivanovna has never cared for me but she didnt care for me i have never been her friend either not for one moment she is too proud to need my friendship
she revenged with me and on me all the insults which she has been continually receiving from dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ever since their first meeting
she kept me at her side as a means of revenge for even that first meeting has rankled in her heart as an insult that what her heart is like
she has talked to me of nothing but her love for him i am going now but believe me katerina_ivanovna you really love him
and the more he insults you the more you love him that your laceration you love him just as he is you love him for insulting you
if he reformed you give him up at once and cease to love him but you need him so as to contemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him for infidelity
and it all comes from your pride oh there a great deal of humiliation and self abasement about it but it all comes from pride
i know that i ought not to say this that it would be more dignified on my part simply to leave you and it would be less offensive for you
i am too young and i ve loved you too much but i am going far away and shall never come back
it is for ever i dont want to sit beside a laceration but i dont know how to speak now i ve said everything
good by katerina_ivanovna you cant be angry with me for i am a hundred time more severely punished than you if only by the fact that i shall never see you again
good by i dont want your hand you have tortured me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this moment
den dank dame begehr ich nicht he added with a forced smile showing however that he could read schiller and read him till he knew him by heart which alyosha_karamazov would never have believed
i shall forgive you later but now i dont want your hand he went out of the room without saying good by even to his hostess madame_hohlakov
alyosha_karamazov clasped his hands ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he cried desperately after him come back ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov no nothing will induce him to come back now
he cried again regretfully realizing it but it my fault my fault i began it ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov spoke angrily wrongly unjustly and angrily
he must come back here come back alyosha_karamazov kept exclaiming frantically katerina_ivanovna went suddenly into the next room you have done no harm
you behaved beautifully like an angel madame_hohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to alyosha_karamazov i will do my utmost to prevent ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov from going
her face beamed with delight to the great distress of alyosha_karamazov but katerina_ivanovna suddenly returned she had two hundred rouble notes in her hand
i have a great favor to ask of you alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov she began addressing alyosha_karamazov with an apparently calm and even voice as though nothing had happened
a week yes i think it was a week ago dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was guilty of a hasty and unjust action a very ugly action
there is a low tavern here and in it he met that discharged officer that captain whom your father_zossima used to employ in some business
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov somehow lost his temper with this captain seized him by the beard and dragged him out into the street and for some distance along it in that insulting fashion
and i am told that his son a boy quite a child who is at the school here saw it and ran beside them crying and begging for his father_zossima appealing to every one to defend him while every one laughed
you must forgive me alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i cannot think without indignation of that disgraceful action of his one of those actions of which only dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov would be capable in his anger and in his passions
i cant describe it even i cant find my words i ve made inquiries about his victim and find he is quite a poor man
and now he has sunk into terrible destitution with his family an unhappy family of sick child and i believe an insane wife
he has been living here a long time he used to work as a copying clerk but now he is getting nothing
his name is snegiryov he did something wrong in the army and was discharged i cant tell you what i thought if you that is i thought
you see i wanted to ask you my dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to go to him to find some excuse to go to them
oh goodness how badly i explain it and delicately carefully as only you know how to alyosha_karamazov blushed manage to give him this assistance these two hundred roubles
i dont know i am so confused i mean to that captain he will be sure to take it i mean persuade him to take it
you see it not by way of compensation to prevent him from taking proceedings for i believe he meant to but simply a token of sympathy of a desire to assist him from me dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov betrothed not from himself
or rather what do i mean but you know i would go myself but you ll know how to do it ever so much better
he lives in lake street in the house of a woman called kalmikov for god sake alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov do it for me and now now i am rather tired
she turned and disappeared behind the portičre so quickly that alyosha_karamazov had not time to utter a word though he wanted to speak
he longed to beg her pardon to blame himself to say something for his heart was full and he could not bear to go out of the room without it
good by but madame_hohlakov took him by the hand and drew him along with her in the hall she stopped him again as before
she is proud she is struggling with herself but kind charming generous she exclaimed in a half whisper oh how i love her especially sometimes and how glad i am again of everything
dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you didnt know but i must tell you that we all all both her aunts i and all of us lise even have been hoping and praying for nothing for the last month but that she may give up your favorite dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov who takes no notice of her and does not care for her and may marry ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov such an excellent and cultivated young man who loves her more than anything in the world
we are in a regular plot to bring it about and i am even staying on here perhaps on that account
but she has been crying she has been wounded again cried alyosha_karamazov never trust a woman tears alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i am never for the women in such cases
i am always on the side of the man mamma you are spoiling him lise little voice cried from behind the door
i am horribly to blame alyosha_karamazov repeated unconsoled hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse for his indiscretion
no it was all my fault quite the contrary you behaved like an angel like an angel i am ready to say so a thousand time over
i somehow fancied all at once alyosha_karamazov went on as though he had not heard lise that she loved ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and so i said that stupid thing
mamma how has he behaved like an angel lise voice was heard again what will happen now to whom to whom cried lise
mamma you really want to be the death of me i ask you and you dont answer at the moment the maid ran in
katerina_ivanovna is ill she is crying struggling hysterics what is the matter cried lise in a tone of real anxiety
mamma i shall be having hysterics and not she lise for mercy sake dont scream dont persecute me at your age one cant know everything that grown up people know
i ll come and tell you everything you ought to know oh mercy on us i am coming i am coming hysterics is a good sign alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov it an excellent thing that she is hysterical
that just as it ought to be in such cases i am always against the woman against all these feminine tears and hysterics
run and say yulia that i ll fly to her as for ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov going away like that it her own fault
but he wont go away lise for mercy sake dont scream oh yes you are not screaming it i am screaming
did you notice alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how young how young ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was just now when he went out when he said all that and went out
i thought he was so learned such a savant and all of a sudden he behaved so warmly openly and youthfully with such youthful inexperience and it was all so fine like you
forgive your mamma but i am delighted delighted delighted and the way he repeated that german verse it was just like you
but i must fly i must fly alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov make haste to carry out her commission and then make haste back
lise do you want anything now for mercy sake dont keep alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov a minute he will come back to you at once
madame_hohlakov at last ran off before leaving alyosha_karamazov would have opened the door to see lise on no account cried lise
on no account now speak through the door how have you come to be an angel that the only thing i want to know
for an awful piece of stupidity lise good by dont dare to go away like that lise was beginning lise i have a real sorrow
i ll be back directly but i have a great great sorrow and he ran out of the room chapter vi
a laceration in the cottage he certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been before he had rushed in like a fool and meddled in what
in a love affair but what do i know about it what can i tell about such things he repeated to himself for the hundredth time flushing crimson
oh being ashamed would be nothing shame is only the punishment i deserve the trouble is i shall certainly have caused more unhappiness
and father_zossima sent me to reconcile and bring them together is this the way to bring them together then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join their hands and he felt fearfully ashamed again
though i acted quite sincerely i must be more sensible in the future he concluded suddenly and did not even smile at his conclusion
katerina_ivanovna commission took him to lake street and his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov lived close by in a turning out of lake street
alyosha_karamazov decided to go to him in any case before going to the captain though he had a presentiment that he would not find his brother
time was passing the thought of his dying elder had not left alyosha_karamazov for one minute from the time he set off from the monastery
there was one point which interested him particularly about katerina_ivanovna commission when she had mentioned the captain son the little schoolboy who had run beside his father_zossima crying the idea had at once struck alyosha_karamazov that this must be the schoolboy who had bitten his finger when he alyosha_karamazov asked him what he had done to hurt him
he suspected that he would intentionally keep out of his way now but he must find him anyhow now alyosha_karamazov felt practically certain of this though he could not have said why
thinking of another subject was a relief and he resolved to think no more about the mischief he had done and not to torture himself with remorse but to do what he had to do let come what would
turning to the street where dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov lodged he felt hungry and taking out of his pocket the roll he had brought from his father_zossima he ate it
at that thought he was completely comforted it made him feel stronger dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was not at home the people of the house an old cabinet maker his son and his old wife looked with positive suspicion at alyosha_karamazov
he hasnt slept here for the last three nights maybe he has gone away the old man said in answer to alyosha_karamazov persistent inquiries
when he asked whether he were not at grushenka or in hiding at foma alyosha_karamazov spoke so freely on purpose all three looked at him in alarm
alyosha_karamazov saw that he was answering in accordance with instructions they are fond of him they are doing their best for him thought alyosha_karamazov
it was a decrepit little house sunk on one side with three windows looking into the street and with a muddy yard in the middle of which stood a solitary cow
that good at last he found the house in lake street he crossed the yard and found the door opening into the passage
on the left of the passage lived the old woman of the house with her old daughter both seemed to be deaf
in answer to his repeated inquiry for the captain one of them at last understood that he was asking for their lodgers and pointed to a door across the passage
alyosha_karamazov had his hand on the iron latch to open the door when he was struck by the strange hush within
the captain lodging turned out to be a simple cottage room yet he knew from katerina_ivanovna words that the man had a family
either they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are waiting for me to open the door
i better knock first and he knocked an answer came but not at once after an interval of perhaps ten second
who there shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice then alyosha_karamazov opened the door and crossed the threshold
though it was large it was cumbered up with domestic belongings of all sort and there were several people in it
from the stove to the window on the left was a string running across the room and on it there were rags hanging
he found himself in a regular peasant room on the left was a large russian stove there was a bedstead against the wall on each side right and left covered with knitted quilts
on the one on the left was a pyramid of four print covered pillows each smaller than the one beneath on the other there was only one very small pillow
the opposite corner was screened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string behind this curtain could be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair
the three windows which consisted each of four tiny greenish mildewy panes gave little light and were close shut so that the room was not very light and rather stuffy
on the table was a frying pan with the remains of some fried eggs a half eaten piece of bread and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka
the rough square table of plain wood had been moved into the middle window a woman of genteel appearance wearing a cotton gown was sitting on a chair by the bed on the left
but what struck alyosha_karamazov most was the expression in the poor woman eye a look of surprised inquiry and yet of haughty pride
and while he was talking to her husband her big brown eye moved from one speaker to the other with the same haughty and questioning expression
her face was thin and yellow and her sunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she was ill beside her at the window stood a young girl rather plain with scanty reddish hair poorly but very neatly dressed
she was a very sad sight a young girl of about twenty but hunchback and crippled with withered legs as alyosha_karamazov was told afterwards
she looked disdainfully at alyosha_karamazov as he came in beside the other bed was sitting another female figure her crutches stood in the corner close by
the strikingly beautiful and gentle eye of this poor girl looked with mild serenity at alyosha_karamazov a man of forty five was sitting at the table finishing the fried eggs
he had reddish hair and a scanty light colored beard very much like a wisp of tow this comparison and the phrase a wisp of tow flashed at once into alyosha_karamazov mind for some reason he remembered it afterwards
he was spare small and weakly built it was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him as there was no other man in the room
but when alyosha_karamazov went in he leapt up from the bench on which he was sitting and hastily wiping his mouth with a ragged napkin darted up to alyosha_karamazov
it a monk come to beg for the monastery a nice place to come to the girl standing in the left corner said aloud
the man spun round instantly towards her and answered her in an excited and breaking voice no varvara you are wrong
allow me to ask he turned again to alyosha_karamazov what has brought you to our retreat alyosha_karamazov looked attentively at him it was the first time he had seen him
there was something angular flurried and irritable about him though he had obviously just been drinking he was not drunk there was extraordinary impudence in his expression and yet strange to say at the same time there was fear
he looked like a man who had long been kept in subjection and had submitted to it and now had suddenly turned and was trying to assert himself
in his words and in the intonation of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy humor at time spiteful and at time cringing and continually shifting from one tone to another
the question about our retreat he had asked as it were quivering all over rolling his eye and skipping up so close to alyosha_karamazov that he instinctively drew back a step
or better still like a man who wants dreadfully to hit you but is horribly afraid you will hit him he was dressed in a very shabby dark cotton coat patched and spotted
they were so crumpled and so short that he looked as though he had grown out of them like a boy
he wore checked trousers of an extremely light color long out of fashion and of very thin material i am alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov alyosha_karamazov began in reply
i quite understand that sir the gentleman snapped out at once to assure him that he knew who he was already
i am captain snegiryov sir but i am still desirous to know precisely what has led you
oh i ve come for nothing special i wanted to have a word with you if only you allow me in that case here is a chair sir kindly be seated
that what they used to say in the old comedies kindly be seated and with a rapid gesture he seized an empty chair it was a rough wooden chair not upholstered and set it for him almost in the middle of the room then taking another similar chair for himself he sat down facing alyosha_karamazov so close to him that their knees almost touched
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin snegiryov sir formerly a captain in the russian infantry put to shame for his vices but still a captain
though i might not be one now for the way i talk for the last half of my life i ve learnt to say sir
it a word you use when you ve come down in the world that very true smiled alyosha_karamazov but is it used involuntarily or on purpose
i didnt use the word sir all my life but as soon as i sank into low water i began to say sir
i see you are interested in contemporary questions but how can i have excited your curiosity living as i do in surroundings impossible for the exercise of hospitality
as god above it involuntary and i usent to use it it the work of a higher power i ve come about that business
about what business the captain interrupted impatiently about your meeting with my brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov blurted out awkwardly
what meeting sir you dont mean that meeting about my wisp of tow then he moved closer so that his knees positively knocked against alyosha_karamazov
he is come to complain of me father_zossima cried a voice familiar to alyosha_karamazov the voice of the schoolboy from behind the curtain
his lips were strangely compressed like a thread what wisp of tow muttered alyosha_karamazov i bit his finger just now
the curtain was pulled and alyosha_karamazov saw his assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corner under the ikons
the boy lay covered by his coat and an old wadded quilt he was evidently unwell and judging by his glittering eye he was in a fever
he looked at alyosha_karamazov without fear as though he felt he was at home and could not be touched what did he bite your finger
the captain jumped up from his chair was it your finger he bit yes he was throwing stones with other schoolboys
there were six of them against him alone i went up to him and he threw a stone at me and then another at my head
i asked him what i had done to him and then he rushed at me and bit my finger badly i dont know why
i ll thrash him sir at once this minute the captain jumped up from his seat but i am not complaining at all i am simply telling you
i dont want him to be thrashed besides he seems to be ill and do you suppose i thrash him
that i take my ilusha and thrash him before you for your satisfaction would you like it done at once sir
i am sorry about your finger sir but instead of thrashing ilusha would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife here before your eye to satisfy your just wrath
said the captain suddenly turning to alyosha_karamazov as though he were going to attack him i should think four fingers would be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance
you wont ask for the fifth one too he stopped short with a catch in his throat every feature in his face was twitching and working he looked extremely defiant
he was in a sort of frenzy i think i understand it all now said alyosha_karamazov gently and sorrowfully still keeping his seat
so your boy is a good boy he loves his father_zossima and he attacked me as the brother of your assailant
but my brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov regrets his action i know that and if only it is possible for him to come to you or better still to meet you in that same place he will ask your forgiveness before every one if you wish it
now i understand it he repeated thoughtfully after pulling out my beard you mean he will ask my forgiveness
and he thinks that will be a satisfactory finish doesnt he oh no on the contrary he will do anything you like and in any way you like
so if i were to ask his highness to go down on his knees before me in that very tavern the metropolis it called or in the market place he would do it
yes he would even go down on his knees you ve pierced me to the heart sir touched me to tears and pierced me to the heart
i am only too sensible of your brother generosity allow me to introduce my family my two daughters and my son my litter
if i die who will care for them and while i live who but they will care for a wretch like me
that a great thing the lord has ordained for every man of my sort sir for there must be some one able to love even a man like me
some idiot comes in and you put us to shame cried the girl by the window suddenly turning to her father_zossima with a disdainful and contemptuous air
ah that perfectly true exclaimed alyosha_karamazov oh do leave off playing the fool wait a little varvara cried her father_zossima speaking peremptorily but looking at her quite approvingly
that her character he said addressing alyosha_karamazov again and in all nature there was naught that could find favor in his eye or rather in the feminine
that could find favor in her eye but now let me present you to my wife arina petrovna she is crippled she is forty three she can move but very little
she is of humble origin arina petrovna compose your countenance this is alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov get up alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he took him by the hand and with unexpected force pulled him up
you must stand up to be introduced to a lady it not the alyosha_karamazov mamma who m etcetera but his brother radiant with modest virtues
come arina petrovna come mamma first your hand to be kissed and he kissed his wife hand respectfully and even tenderly
the girl at the window turned her back indignantly on the scene an expression of extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of the woman
good morning sit down mr tchernomazov she said alyosha_karamazov mamma alyosha_karamazov we are of humble origin he whispered again
well alyosha_karamazov or whatever it is but i always think of tchernomazov sit down why has he pulled you up
he calls me crippled but i am not only my legs are swollen like barrels and i am shriveled up myself
once i used to be so fat but now it as though i had swallowed a needle we are of humble origin the captain muttered again
the hunchback girl who had till then been silent on her chair said suddenly and she hid her eye in her handkerchief
oh father_zossima father buffoon blurted out the girl at the window have you heard our news said the mother pointing at her daughters
it like clouds coming over the clouds pass and we have music again when we were with the army we used to have many such guests
the deacon wife used to come then and say alexandr alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest heart but nastasya petrovna she would say is of the brood of hell
i dont mean to make any comparisons every one to their taste well i said that a matter of taste but you are a little spitfire
and you want keeping in your place says she you black sword said i who asked you to teach me
but my breath says she is clean and yours is unclean you ask all the officers whether my breath is unclean
not long ago i was sitting here as i am now when i saw that very general come in who came here for easter and i asked him your excellency said i can a lady breath be unpleasant
yes he answered you ought to open a window pane or open the door for the air is not fresh here
and ever since then i had it in my mind and they all go on like that and what is my breath to them
the dead smell worse still i wont spoil the air said i i ll order some slippers and go away my darlings dont blame your own mother
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin how is it i cant please you there only ilusha who comes home from school and loves me yesterday he brought me an apple
forgive your own mother forgive a poor lonely creature why has my breath become unpleasant to you and the poor mad woman broke into sobs and tears streamed down her cheeks
the captain rushed up to her mamma mamma my dear give over you are not lonely every one loves you every one adores you
he began kissing both her hands again and tenderly stroking her face taking the dinner napkin he began wiping away her tears
alyosha_karamazov fancied that he too had tears in his eye there you see you hear he turned with a sort of fury to alyosha_karamazov pointing to the poor imbecile
i see and hear muttered alyosha_karamazov father_zossima father how can you with him let him alone cried the boy sitting up in his bed and gazing at his father_zossima with glowing eye
do give over fooling showing off your silly antics which never lead to anything shouted varvara stamping her foot with passion
your anger is quite just this time varvara and i ll make haste to satisfy you come put on your cap alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and i ll put on mine
we will go out i have a word to say to you in earnest but not within these walls this girl sitting here is my daughter nina i forgot to introduce her to you
she is a heavenly angel incarnate who has flown down to us mortals if you can understand there he is shaking all over as though he is in convulsions
varvara went on indignantly and she there stamping her foot at me and calling me a fool just now
she is a heavenly angel incarnate too and she has good reason to call me so come along alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov we must make an end
and in the open air the air is fresh but in my apartment it is not so in any sense of the word
and snatching alyosha_karamazov hand he drew him out of the room into the street chapter vii let us walk slowly sir
i should be glad of your kind interest i too have something important to say to you observed alyosha_karamazov only i dont know how to begin
to be sure you must have business with me you would never have looked in upon me without some object
and by the way about the boy i could not explain to you in there but here i will describe that scene to you
unless you come simply to complain of the boy and that hardly likely my tow was thicker a week ago i mean my beard
that the nickname they give to my beard the schoolboys most of all well your brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was pulling me by my beard
he dragged me out of the tavern into the market place at that moment the boys were coming out of school and with them ilusha
i done nothing he was in a towering rage and happened to come upon me as soon as he saw me in such a state he rushed up to me
he caught hold of me hugged me tried to pull me away crying to my assailant let go let go it my father_zossima forgive him yes he actually cried forgive him
father_zossima he cried father_zossima he clutched at that hand that very hand in his little hands and kissed it i remember his little face at that moment i havent forgotten it and i never shall
i swear cried alyosha_karamazov that my brother will express his most deep and sincere regret even if he has to go down on his knees in that same market place
i ll make him or he is no brother of mine aha then it only a suggestion and it does not come from him but simply from the generosity of your own warm heart
no in that case allow me to tell you of your brother highly chivalrous soldierly generosity for he did give expression to it at the time
he left off dragging me by my beard and released me you are an officer he said and i am an officer if you can find a decent man to be your second
you should have said so send me your challenge i will give satisfaction though you are a scoundrel that what he said
a chivalrous spirit indeed i retired with ilusha and that scene is a family record imprinted for ever on ilusha soul
no it not for us to claim the privileges of noblemen judge for yourself you ve just been in our mansion what did you see there
three lady one a cripple and weak minded another a cripple and hunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever
she is a student dying to get back to petersburg to work for the emancipation of the russian woman on the bank of the neva
i wont speak of ilusha he is only nine i am alone in the world and if i die what will become of all of them
i simply ask you that and if i challenge him and he kills me on the spot what then what will become of them
and worse still if he doesnt kill me but only cripples me i couldnt work but i should still be a mouth to feed
who would feed it and who would feed them all must i take ilusha from school and send him to beg in the streets
he will beg your forgiveness he will bow down at your feet in the middle of the market place cried alyosha_karamazov again with glowing eye
i did think of prosecuting him the captain went on but look in our code could i get much compensation for a personal injury
that what it means for me to challenge him to a duel it silly talk and nothing else and then agrafena_alexandrovna sent for me and shouted at me
if you proceed against him i ll publish it to all the world that he beat you for your dishonesty and then you will be prosecuted
i call god to witness whose was the dishonesty and by whose commands i acted wasnt it by her own and fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
dont dare to dream of it and what more she went on i ll dismiss you for good and you ll never earn another penny from me
i ll speak to my merchant too that what she calls her old man and he will dismiss you and if he dismisses me what can i earn then from any one
those two are all i have to look to for your fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov has not only given over employing me for another reason but he means to make use of papers i ve signed to go to law against me
and so i kept quiet and you have seen our retreat but now let me ask you did ilusha hurt your finger much
i didnt like to go into it in our mansion before him yes very much and he was in a great fury
he was avenging you on me as a alyosha_karamazov i see that now but if only you had seen how he was throwing stones at his school fellows
it very dangerous they might kill him they are child and stupid a stone may be thrown and break somebody head
that just what has happened he has been bruised by a stone to day not on the head but on the chest just above the heart
he came home crying and groaning and now he is ill and you know he attacks them first he is bitter against them on your account
they say he stabbed a boy called kolya_krassotkin with a pen knife not long ago i ve heard about that too it dangerous
i would advise you alyosha_karamazov went on warmly not to send him to school at all for a time till he is calmer and his anger is passed
kolya_krassotkin is an official here we may hear more about it anger the captain repeated that just what it is he is a little creature but it a mighty anger
you dont know all sir let me tell you more since that incident all the boys have been teasing him about the wisp of tow
schoolboys are a merciless race individually they are angels but together especially in schools they are often merciless their teasing has stirred up a gallant spirit in ilusha
an ordinary boy a weak son would have submitted have felt ashamed of his father_zossima sir but he stood up for his father_zossima against them all
for what he suffered when he kissed your brother hand and cried to him forgive father_zossima forgive him that only god knows and i his father_zossima
for our child not your child but ours the child of the poor gentlemen looked down upon by every one know what justice means sir even at nine years old
for his father_zossima and for truth and justice how should the rich know they dont explore such depths once in their lives
but at that moment in the square when he kissed his hand at that moment my ilusha had grasped all that justice means
that truth entered into him and crushed him for ever sir the captain said hotly again with a sort of frenzy and he struck his right fist against his left palm as though he wanted to show how the truth crushed ilusha
all that day he hardly said a word to me but i noticed he kept watching me from the corner though he turned to the window and pretended to be learning his lessons
that very day sir he fell ill with fever and was delirious all night but i could see his mind was not on his lessons
next day i got drunk to forget my troubles sinful man as i am and i dont remember much mamma began crying too i am very fond of mamma well i spent my last penny drowning my troubles
dont despise me for that sir in russia man who drink are the best the best man amongst us are the greatest drunkards
i lay down and i dont remember about ilusha though all that day the boys had been jeering at him at school
wisp of tow they shouted your father_zossima was pulled out of the tavern by his wisp of tow you ran by and begged forgiveness
on the third day when he came back from school i saw he looked pale and wretched what is it
i asked he wouldnt answer well there no talking in our mansion without mamma and the girls taking part in it
what more the girls had heard about it the very first day varvara had begun snarling you fools and buffoons can you ever do anything rational
so in the evening i took the boy out for a walk for you must know we go for a walk every evening always the same way along which we are going now from our gate to that great stone which lies alone in the road under the hurdle which marks the beginning of the town pasture
quite so i said can we ever do anything rational for the time i turned it off like that a beautiful and lonely spot sir
ilusha and i walked along hand in hand as usual he has a little hand his fingers are thin and cold he suffers with his chest you know
father_zossima said he father_zossima well said i i saw his eye flashing father_zossima how he treated you then
it cant be helped ilusha i said dont forgive him father_zossima dont forgive him at school they say that he has paid you ten roubles for it
no ilusha said i i would not take money from him for anything then he began trembling all over took my hand in both his and kissed it again
father_zossima he said father_zossima challenge him to a duel at school they say you are a coward and wont challenge him and that you ll accept ten roubles from him
i cant challenge him to a duel ilusha i answered and i told briefly what i ve just told you he listened
father_zossima he said anyway dont forgive it when i grow up i ll call him out myself and kill him his eye shone and glowed
and of course i am his father_zossima and i had to put in a word it a sin to kill i said even in a duel
father_zossima he said when i grow up i ll knock him down knock the sword out of his hand i ll fall on him wave my sword over him and say i could kill you but i forgive you so there
you see what the workings of his little mind have been during these two day he must have been planning that vengeance all day and raving about it at night
but he began to come home from school badly beaten i found out about it the day before yesterday and you are right
i heard that he was standing up against all the class alone and defying them all that his heart was full of resentment of bitterness i was alarmed about him
i wont send him to that school any more we went for another walk father_zossima he asked are the rich people stronger than any one else on earth
yes ilusha i said there are no people on earth stronger than the rich father_zossima he said i will get rich i will become an officer and conquer everybody
the tsar will reward me i will come back here and then no one will dare then he was silent and his lips still kept trembling
father_zossima he said what a horrid town this is yes ilusha i said it isnt a very nice town
father_zossima let us move into another town a nice one he said where people dont know about us we will move we will ilusha said i only i must save up for it
i was glad to be able to turn his mind from painful thoughts and we began to dream of how we would move to another town how we would buy a horse and cart
we will put mamma and your sisters inside we will cover them up and we ll walk you shall have a lift now and then and i ll walk beside for we must take care of our horse we cant all ride
that how we ll go he was enchanted at that most of all at the thought of having a horse and driving him
for of course a russian boy is born among horses we chattered a long while thank god i thought i have diverted his mind and comforted him
that was the day before yesterday in the evening but last night everything was changed he had gone to school in the morning he came back depressed terribly depressed
in the evening i took him by the hand and we went for a walk he would not talk there was a wind blowing and no sun and a feeling of autumn twilight was coming on
we walked along both of us depressed well my boy said i how about our setting off on our travels
i thought i might bring him back to our talk of the day before he didnt answer but i felt his fingers trembling in my hand
ah i thought it a bad job there something fresh we had reached the stone where we are now i sat down on the stone
and in the air there were lots of kites flapping and whirling there were as many as thirty in sight of course it just the season for the kites
look ilusha said i it time we got out our last year kite again i ll mend it where have you put it away
my boy made no answer he looked away and turned sideways to me and then a gust of wind blew up the sand
you know when child are silent and proud and try to keep back their tears when they are in great trouble and suddenly break down their tears fall in streams
he suddenly fell on me threw both his little arms round my neck and held me tight with those warm streams of tears he suddenly wetted my face
he sobbed and shook as though he were in convulsions and squeezed up against me as i sat on the stone
father_zossima he kept crying dear father_zossima how he insulted you and i sobbed too we sat shaking in each other arms
ilusha i said to him ilusha darling no one saw us then god alone saw us i hope he will record it to my credit
you must thank your brother alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov no sir i wont thrash my boy for your satisfaction he had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery
alyosha_karamazov felt though that he trusted him and that if there had been some one else in his alyosha_karamazov place the man would not have spoken so openly and would not have told what he had just told
this encouraged alyosha_karamazov whose heart was trembling on the verge of tears ah how i would like to make friends with your boy
he cried if you could arrange it certainly sir muttered the captain but now listen to something quite different
alyosha_karamazov went on i have a message for you that same brother of mine dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov has insulted his betrothed too a noble hearted girl of whom you have probably heard
i have a right to tell you of her wrong i ought to do so in fact for hearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate position she commissioned me at once just now to bring you this help from her but only from her alone not from dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov who has abandoned her
nor from me his brother nor from any one else but from her only from her she entreats you to accept her help
you have both been insulted by the same man she thought of you only when she had just received a similar insult from him similar in its cruelty i mean
she told me to persuade you to take these two hundred roubles from her as from a sister knowing that you are in such need
she comes like a sister to help a brother in misfortune no one will know of it it can give rise to no unjust slander
there are the two hundred roubles and i swear you must take them unless unless all man are to be enemies on earth
but there are brothers even on earth you have a generous heart you must see that you must and alyosha_karamazov held out two new rainbow colored hundred rouble notes
they were both standing at the time by the great stone close to the fence and there was no one near
the notes seemed to produce a tremendous impression on the captain he started but at first only from astonishment such an outcome of their conversation was the last thing he expected
he took the notes and for a minute he was almost unable to answer quite a new expression came into his face
nothing could have been farther from his dreams than help from any one and such a sum that for me so much money two hundred roubles
good heavens why i havent seen so much money for the last four years mercy on us and she says she is a sister
and is that the truth i swear that all i told you is the truth cried alyosha_karamazov the captain flushed red
listen my dear listen if i take it i shant be behaving like a scoundrel in your eye alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i shant be a scoundrel
you are persuading me to take it saying that it a sister sends it but inwardly in your heart wont you feel contempt for me if i take it eh
no alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov listen listen he hurried touching alyosha_karamazov with both his hands no no on my salvation i swear i shant
and no one will ever know but me i you and she and one other lady her great friend never mind the lady
listen alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov at a moment like this you must listen for you cant understand what these two hundred roubles mean to me now
he was thrown off his balance and talked extremely fast as though afraid he would not be allowed to say all he had to say
besides its being honestly acquired from a sister so highly respected and revered do you know that now i can look after mamma and nina my hunchback angel daughter
doctor herzenstube came to me in the kindness of his heart and was examining them both for a whole hour
i can make nothing of it said he but he prescribed a mineral water which is kept at a chemist here
the poor fellow went on rising gradually into a sort of incoherent almost wild enthusiasm he said it would be sure to do her good and he ordered baths too with some medicine in them
the mineral water costs thirty copecks and she need to drink forty bottles perhaps so i took the prescription and laid it on the shelf under the ikons and there it lies
but how can we carry out such a cure in our mansion without servants without help without a bath and without water
and he ordered hot baths for nina with something dissolved in them morning and evening nina is rheumatic all over i dont think i told you that
all her right side aches at night she is in agony and would you believe it the angel bears it without groaning for fear of waking us
i am not worth it i am taking it from you i am a burden on you that what her angel eye try to express
we eat what we can get and she ll only take the leavings what you scarcely give to a dog we wait on her but she doesnt like it
i am a useless cripple no good to any one as though she were not worth it when she is the saving of all of us with her angelic sweetness
without her without her gentle word it would be hell among us she softens even varvara and dont judge varvara harshly either she is an angel too she too has suffered wrong
she came to us for the summer and she brought sixteen roubles she had earned by lessons and saved up to go back with to petersburg in september that is now
but we took her money and lived on it so now she has nothing to go back with though indeed she couldnt go back for she has to work for us like a slave
she is like an overdriven horse with all of us on her back she waits on us all mends and washes sweeps the floor puts mamma to bed
and now i can get a servant with this money you understand alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i can get medicines for the dear creatures i can send my student to petersburg i can buy beef i can feed them properly
alyosha_karamazov was delighted that he had brought him such happiness and that the poor fellow had consented to be made happy
and mamma is capricious and tearful and insane good lord but it a dream stay alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stay the captain began to talk with frenzied rapidity carried away by a new day dream
we will buy a horse and cart a black horse he insists on its being black and we will set off as we pretended the other day
i have an old friend a lawyer in province and i heard through a trustworthy man that if i were to go he give me a place as clerk in his office so who knows maybe he would
do you know that ilusha and i will perhaps really carry out our dream so i just put mamma and nina in the cart and ilusha could drive and i walk i walk
why if i only succeed in getting one debt paid that owing me i should have perhaps enough for that too
katerina_ivanovna will send you as much more as you need and you know i have money too take what you want as you would from a brother from a friend you can give it back later
there would be enough cried alyosha_karamazov you ll get rich you ll get rich and you know you couldnt have a better idea than to move to another province
it would be the saving of you especially of your boy and you ought to go quickly before the winter before the cold
you must write to us when you are there and we will always be brothers no it not a dream alyosha_karamazov could have hugged him he was so pleased
but glancing at him he stopped short the man was standing with his neck outstretched and his lips protruding with a pale and frenzied face
his lips were moving as though trying to articulate something no sound came but still his lips moved it was uncanny
i you muttered the captain faltering looking at him with a strange wild fixed stare and an air of desperate resolution
what is it asked alyosha_karamazov startled alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov at the same time there was a sort of grin on his lips
i you sir wouldnt you like me to show you a little trick i know he murmured suddenly in a firm rapid whisper his voice no longer faltering
what trick a pretty trick whispered the captain his mouth was twisted on the left side his left eye was screwed up
why look squealed the captain suddenly and showing him the two notes which he had been holding by one corner between his thumb and forefinger during the conversation he crumpled them up savagely and squeezed them tight in his right hand
he still stared at alyosha_karamazov what is the matter what trick alyosha_karamazov cried now thoroughly alarmed do you see do you see
he shrieked pale and infuriated and suddenly flinging up his hand he threw the crumpled notes on the sand
do you see he shrieked again pointing to them look there and with wild fury he began trampling them under his heel gasping and exclaiming as he did so
so much for your money so much for your money so much for your money so much for your money
tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his honor he cried raising his arm in the air
then he turned quickly and began to run but he had not run five steps before he turned completely round and kissed his hand to alyosha_karamazov
suddenly he darted back and drew himself up before alyosha_karamazov and his whole figure expressed unutterable pride he ran another five paces and then turned round for the last time
in a tearful faltering sobbing voice he cried what should i say to my boy if i took money from you for our shame
this time his face was not contorted with laughter but quivering all over with tears and then he ran on without turning
oh he saw that till the very last moment the man had not known he would crumple up and fling away the notes
alyosha_karamazov looked after him inexpressibly grieved he did not turn back alyosha_karamazov knew he would not he would not follow him and call him back he knew why
they were very much crushed and crumpled and had been pressed into the sand but were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when alyosha_karamazov unfolded them and smoothed them out
after smoothing them out he folded them up put them in his pocket and went to katerina_ivanovna to report on the success of her commission
when he was out of sight alyosha_karamazov picked up the two notes book pro and contra chapter i the engagement madame_hohlakov was again the first to meet alyosha_karamazov
katerina_ivanovna hysterics had ended in a fainting fit and then a terrible awful weakness had followed she lay with her eye turned up and was delirious
she was flustered something important had happened now she was in a fever they had sent for herzenstube they had sent for the aunts
the aunts were already here but herzenstube had not yet come they were all sitting in her room waiting she was unconscious now and what if it turned to brain fever
this is serious serious she added at every word as though nothing that had happened to her before had been serious
madame_hohlakov looked gravely alarmed alyosha_karamazov listened with distress and was beginning to describe his adventures but she interrupted him at the first words
she had not time to listen she begged him to sit with lise and wait for her there lise she whispered almost in his ear lise has greatly surprised me just now dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
only fancy as soon as you had gone she began to be truly remorseful for having laughed at you to day and yesterday though she was not laughing at you but only joking
she touched me too and so my heart forgives her everything but she was seriously sorry for it almost ready to cry so that i was quite surprised
she has never been really sorry for laughing at me but has only made a joke of it and you know she is laughing at me every minute
she thinks a great deal of your opinion alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and dont take offense or be wounded by her if you can help it
but this time she was in earnest i am never hard upon her for she such a clever little thing would you believe it
she said just now that you were a friend of her childhood the greatest friend of her childhood just think of that greatest friend and what about me
she has very strong feeling and memories and what more she uses these phrases most unexpected words which come out all of a sudden when you least expect them
she spoke lately about a pine tree for instance there used to be a pine tree standing in our garden in her early childhood
very likely it standing there still so there no need to speak in the past tense pine trees are not like people alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov they dont change quickly
mamma she said i remember this pine tree as in a dream only she said something so original about it that i cant repeat it
besides i ve forgotten it well good by i am so worried i feel i shall go out of my mind ah alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i ve been out of my mind twice in my life
go to lise cheer her up as you always can so charmingly lise she cried going to her door here i ve brought you alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov whom you insulted so
he is not at all angry i assure you on the contrary he is surprised that you could suppose so merci maman
she was evidently ashamed of something and as people always do in such cases she began immediately talking of other things as though they were of absorbing interest to her at the moment
mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and your taking them to that poor officer and she told me all the awful story of how he had been insulted
come in alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov went in lise looked rather embarrassed and at once flushed crimson and you know although mamma muddles things she always rushes from one thing to another
i cried when i heard well did you give him the money and how is that poor man getting on
the fact is i didnt give it to him and it a long story answered alyosha_karamazov as though he too could think of nothing but his regret at having failed yet lise saw perfectly well that he too looked away and that he too was trying to talk of other things
alyosha_karamazov sat down to the table and began to tell his story but at the first words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of lise attention as well
he spoke with deep feeling under the influence of the strong impression he had just received and he succeeded in telling his story well and circumstantially
in old day in moscow he had been fond of coming to lise and describing to her what had just happened to him what he had read or what he remembered of his childhood
sometimes they had made day dreams and woven whole romances together generally cheerful and amusing ones now they both felt suddenly transported to the old day in moscow two years before
when he finished describing how the luckless man trampled on the money lise could not help clasping her hands and crying out
lise was extremely touched by his story alyosha_karamazov described ilusha with warm feeling so you didnt give him the money so you let him run away
oh dear you ought to have run after him no lise it better i didnt run after him said alyosha_karamazov getting up from his chair and walking thoughtfully across the room
how so how is it better now they are without food and their case is hopeless not hopeless for the two hundred roubles will still come to them
he ll take the money to morrow to morrow he will be sure to take it said alyosha_karamazov pacing up and down pondering
you see lise he went on stopping suddenly before her i made one blunder but that even that is all for the best
what blunder and why is it for the best i ll tell you he is a man of weak and timorous character he has suffered so much and is very good natured
i keep wondering why he took offense so suddenly for i assure you up to the last minute he did not know that he was going to trample on the notes
and i think now that there was a great deal to offend him and it could not have been otherwise in his position
to begin with he was sore at having been so glad of the money in my presence and not having concealed it from me
if he had been pleased but not so much if he had not shown it if he had begun affecting scruples and difficulties as other people do when they take money he might still endure to take it
but he was too genuinely delighted and that was mortifying ah lise he is a good and truthful man that the worst of the whole business
all the while he talked his voice was so weak so broken he talked so fast so fast he kept laughing such a laugh
yes i am sure he was crying he was so delighted and he talked about his daughters and about the situation he could get in another town
or perhaps he was crying and when he had poured out his heart he felt ashamed at having shown me his inmost soul like that
what had made him feel most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and accepted me as a friend you see
at first he almost flew at me and tried to intimidate me but as soon as he saw the money he had begun embracing me he kept touching me with his hands
this must have been how he came to feel it all so humiliating and then i made that blunder a very important one
i suddenly said to him that if he had not money enough to move to another town we would give it to him and indeed i myself would give him as much as he wanted out of my own money
so he began to hate me at once he is one of those awfully sensitive poor people that struck him all at once
you know lise it awfully hard for a man who has been injured when other people look at him as though they were his benefactors
why he thought did i put myself forward to help him i ve heard that father_zossima told me so i dont know how to put it but i have often seen it myself
and the worst of it was that though he did not know up to the very last minute that he would trample on the notes he had a kind of presentiment of it i am sure of that
and i feel like that myself too that just what made him so ecstatic that he had that presentiment and though it so dreadful it all for the best
in fact i believe nothing better could have happened why why could nothing better have happened cried lise looking with great surprise at alyosha_karamazov
because if he had taken the money in an hour after getting home he would be crying with mortification that just what would have happened
and most likely he would have come to me early to morrow and perhaps have flung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he did just now
so now nothing could be easier than to make him accept the two hundred roubles by to morrow for he has already vindicated his honor tossed away the money and trampled it under foot
he couldnt know when he did it that i should bring it to him again to morrow and yet he is in terrible need of that money
but now he has gone home awfully proud and triumphant though he knows he has ruined himself though he is proud of himself now yet even to day he ll be thinking what a help he has lost
he will think of it more than ever at night will dream of it and by to morrow morning he may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness
here you are a proud man i shall say you have shown it but now take the money and forgive us
it just then that i ll appear and then he will take it alyosha_karamazov was carried away with joy as he uttered his last words and then he will take it
lise clapped her hands ah that true i understand that perfectly now ah alyosha_karamazov how do you know all this
the great thing now is to persuade him that he is on an equal footing with us in spite of his taking money from us alyosha_karamazov went on in his excitement and not only on an equal but even on a higher footing
so young and yet he knows what in the heart i should never have worked it out on a higher footing is charming alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but go on go on
you mean there isnt such an expression as on a higher footing but that doesnt matter because oh no of course it doesnt matter
that is i respected you but on an equal footing but now i shall begin to respect you on a higher footing
forgive me alyosha_karamazov dear you know i scarcely respected you till now dont be angry dear at my joking she put in at once with strong feeling
i am absurd and small but you you listen alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov isnt there in all our analysis i mean your analysis
no better call it ours arent we showing contempt for him for that poor man in analyzing his soul like this as it were from above eh
in deciding so certainly that he will take the money no lise it not contempt alyosha_karamazov answered as though he had prepared himself for the question
how can it be contempt when we are all like him when we are all just the same as he is
i was thinking of that on the way here for you know we are just the same no better if we are better we should have been just the same in his place
i dont know about you lise but i consider that i have a sordid soul in many ways and his soul is not sordid on the contrary full of fine feeling
do you know lise my elder told me once to care for most people exactly as one would for child and for some of them as one would for the sick in hospitals
no lise i have no contempt for him ah alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dear let us care for people as we would for the sick
let us lise i am ready though i am not altogether ready in myself i am sometimes very impatient and at other time i dont see things
it different with you ah i dont believe it alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how happy i am i am so glad you say so lise
alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you are wonderfully good but you are sometimes sort of formal and yet you are not a bit formal really
go to the door open it gently and see whether mamma is listening said lise in a nervous hurried whisper alyosha_karamazov went opened the door and reported that no one was listening
i have to make a great confession i didnt write to you yesterday in joke but in earnest and she hid her eye with her hand
come here alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov lise went on flushing redder and redder give me your hand that right it was evident that she was greatly ashamed of the confession
suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three time ah lise what a good thing cried alyosha_karamazov joyfully
you know i was perfectly sure you were in earnest sure upon my word she put aside his hand but did not leave go of it blushing hotly and laughing a little happy laugh
i kiss his hand and he says what a good thing but her reproach was undeserved alyosha_karamazov too was greatly overcome
i should like to please you always lise but i dont know how to do it he muttered blushing too
alyosha_karamazov dear you are cold and rude do you see he has chosen me as his wife and is quite settled about it
he is sure i was in earnest what a thing to say why that impertinence that what it is why was it wrong of me to feel sure
alyosha_karamazov asked laughing suddenly ah alyosha_karamazov on the contrary it was delightfully right cried lise looking tenderly and happily at him
alyosha_karamazov stood still holding her hand in his suddenly he stooped down and kissed her on her lips oh what are you doing
cried lise alyosha_karamazov was terribly abashed oh forgive me if i shouldnt perhaps i awfully stupid you said i was cold so i kissed you
but i see it was stupid lise laughed and hid her face in her hands and in that dress she ejaculated in the midst of her mirth
but she suddenly ceased laughing and became serious almost stern alyosha_karamazov we must put off kissing we are not ready for that yet and we shall have a long time to wait she ended suddenly
tell me rather why you who are so clever so intellectual so observant choose a little idiot an invalid like me
ah alyosha_karamazov i am awfully happy for i dont deserve you a bit you do lise i shall be leaving the monastery altogether in a few day
if i go into the world i must marry i know that he told me to marry too whom could i marry better than you and who would have me except you
i have been thinking it over in the first place you ve known me from a child and you ve a great many qualities i havent
you are more light hearted than i am above all you are more innocent than i am i have been brought into contact with many many things already
ah you dont know but i too am a alyosha_karamazov what does it matter if you do laugh and make jokes and at me too
go on laughing i am so glad you do you laugh like a little child but you think like a martyr
yes lise your question just now whether we werent showing contempt for that poor man by dissecting his soul that was the question of a sufferer
you see i dont know how to express it but any one who thinks of such questions is capable of suffering
like a martyr how sitting in your invalid chair you must have thought over many things already alyosha_karamazov give me your hand
why are you taking it away murmured lise in a failing voice weak with happiness listen alyosha_karamazov what will you wear when you come out of the monastery
what sort of suit dont laugh dont be angry it very very important to me i havent thought about the suit lise but i ll wear whatever you like
i should like you to have a dark blue velvet coat a white piqué waistcoat and a soft gray felt hat
tell me did you believe that i didnt care for you when i said i didnt mean what i wrote
you see i knew that you seemed to care for me but i pretended to believe that you didnt care for me to make it easier for you
no i didnt believe it oh you insupportable person you are incorrigible that makes it worse
worse and better than all alyosha_karamazov i am awfully fond of you just before you came this morning i tried my fortune
i decided i would ask you for my letter and if you brought it out calmly and gave it to me as might have been expected from you it would mean that you did not love me at all that you felt nothing and were simply a stupid boy good for nothing and that i am ruined
you left it behind on purpose so as not to give it back because you knew i would ask for it
but you left the letter at home and that cheered me that was it wasnt it ah lise it was not so a bit
the letter is with me now and it was this morning in this pocket here it is alyosha_karamazov pulled the letter out laughing and showed it her at a distance
but i am not going to give it to you look at it from here why then you told a lie
you a monk told a lie i told a lie if you like alyosha_karamazov laughed too i told a lie so as not to give you back the letter
it very precious to me he added suddenly with strong feeling and again he flushed it always will be and i wont give it up to any one
lise looked at him joyfully alyosha_karamazov she murmured again look at the door isnt mamma listening very well lise i ll look but wouldnt it be better not to look
why suspect your mother of such meanness what meanness as for her spying on her daughter it her right it not meanness
you may be sure alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that when i am a mother if i have a daughter like myself i shall certainly spy on her
cried lise firing up really lise that not right oh my goodness what has meanness to do with it
if she were listening to some ordinary worldly conversation it would be meanness but when her own daughter is shut up with a young man
do you know i shall spy upon you as soon as we are married and let me tell you i shall open all your letters and read them so you may as well be prepared
listen alyosha_karamazov yes of course if so muttered alyosha_karamazov only it not right ah how contemptuous alyosha_karamazov dear we wont quarrel the very first day
i better tell you the whole truth of course it very wrong to spy on people and of course i am not right and you are
only i shall spy on you all the same do then you wont find out anything laughed alyosha_karamazov and alyosha_karamazov will you give in to me
we must decide that too i shall be delighted to lise and certain to only not in the most important things
that right but let me tell you i am ready to give in to you not only in the most important matters but in everything
even if you dont agree with me i shall do my duty in the most important things and i am ready to vow to do so now in everything and for all my life
cried lise fervently and i ll do it gladly gladly what more i ll swear never to spy on you never once never to read one of your letters
and though i shall be awfully tempted to spy i know that i wont do it since you consider it dishonorable
for you are right and i am not you are my conscience now listen alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov why have you been so sad lately both yesterday and to day
i know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble but i see you have some special grief besides some secret one perhaps
yes lise i have a secret one too answered alyosha_karamazov mournfully i see you love me since you guessed that
what grief what about can you tell me asked lise with timid entreaty i ll tell you later lise afterwards said alyosha_karamazov confused
now you wouldnt understand it perhaps and perhaps i couldnt explain it i know your brothers and your father_zossima are worrying you too
yes my brothers too murmured alyosha_karamazov pondering i dont like your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov said lise suddenly he noticed this remark with some surprise but did not answer it
my brothers are destroying themselves he went on my father_zossima too and they are destroying others with them it the primitive force of the karamazovs as father_zossima father_paďssy said the other day a crude unbridled earthly force
does the spirit of god move above that force even that i dont know i only know that i too am a alyosha_karamazov
me a monk a monk am i a monk lise you said just now that i was yes i did
and perhaps i dont even believe in god you dont believe what is the matter said lise quietly and gently
there was something too mysterious too subjective in these last words of his perhaps obscure to himself but yet torturing him
and now on the top of it all my friend the best man in the world is going is leaving the earth
but alyosha_karamazov did not answer if you knew lise how bound up in soul i am with him and then i shall be left alone
i shall come to you lise for the future we will be together yes together together henceforward we shall be always together all our lives
listen kiss me i allow you alyosha_karamazov kissed her come now go church_of_christ be with you and she made the sign of the cross over him
make haste back to him while he is alive i see i ve kept you cruelly i ll pray to day for him and you
alyosha_karamazov thought it better not to go in to madame_hohlakov and was going out of the house without saying good by to her
alyosha_karamazov we shall be happy shall we be happy shall we i believe we shall lise but no sooner had he opened the door than he found madame_hohlakov standing before him
from the first word alyosha_karamazov guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to meet him alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov this is awful
this is all childish nonsense and ridiculous i trust you wont dream it foolishness nothing but foolishness she said attacking him at once
only dont tell her that said alyosha_karamazov or she will be upset and that bad for her now sensible advice from a sensible young man
am i to understand that you only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state because you didnt want to irritate her by contradiction
to be serious about it is impossible unthinkable and in the first place i shall never be at home to you again and i shall take her away you may be sure of that
oh no not at all i was quite serious in what i said alyosha_karamazov declared stoutly but why asked alyosha_karamazov
ah alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that true of course and you ll have time to quarrel and separate a thousand time in a year and a half
it all so far off we may have to wait another year and a half but i am so unhappy
though it such nonsense it a great blow to me i feel like famusov in the last scene of sorrow from wit
i ve run down to meet you on the stairs and in the play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase
you are tchatsky and she is sofya and only fancy i heard it all i almost dropped so this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her hysterics of late
it means love to the daughter but death to the mother i might as well be in my grave at once
and a more serious matter still what is this letter she has written show it me at once at once
no there no need tell me how is katerina_ivanovna now i must know she still lies in delirium she has not regained consciousness
her aunts are here but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs herzenstube came and he was so alarmed that i didnt know what to do for him
i nearly sent for a doctor to look after him he was driven home in my carriage and on the top of it all you and this letter
it true nothing can happen for a year and a half in the name of all that holy in the name of your dying elder show me that letter alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
i her mother hold it in your hand if you like and i will read it so no i wont show it to you
even if she sanctioned it i wouldnt i am coming to morrow and if you like we can talk over many things but now good by
and alyosha_karamazov ran downstairs and into the street chapter ii smerdyakov with a guitar he had no time to lose indeed
even while he was saying good by to lise the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov who was evidently keeping out of his way
it was getting late nearly three clock alyosha_karamazov whole soul turned to the monastery to his dying saint but the necessity of seeing dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov outweighed everything
what that catastrophe was and what he would say at that moment to his brother he could perhaps not have said definitely
even if my benefactor must die without me anyway i wont have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that i might have saved something and did not but passed by and hastened home
the conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in alyosha_karamazov mind with every hour if i do as i intend i shall be following his great precept
his plan was to catch his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov unawares to climb over the fence as he had the day before get into the garden and sit in the summer house
if dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov were not there thought alyosha_karamazov he would not announce himself to foma or the women of the house but would remain hidden in the summer house even if he had to wait there till evening
if as before dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov were lying in wait for grushenka to come he would be very likely to come to the summer house
alyosha_karamazov did not however give much thought to the details of his plan but resolved to act upon it even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day
everything happened without hindrance he climbed over the hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before and stole into the summer house unseen
the woman of the house and foma too if he were here might be loyal to his brother and obey his instructions and so refuse to let alyosha_karamazov come into the garden or might warn dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov that he was being sought and inquired for
he did not want to be noticed there was no one in the summer house alyosha_karamazov sat down and began to wait
he looked round the summer house which somehow struck him as a great deal more ancient than before though the day was just as fine as yesterday it seemed a wretched little place this time
there was a circle on the table left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before
he wondered for instance why he had sat down precisely in the same place as before why not in the other seat
foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his mind as they always do in a time of tedious waiting at last he felt very depressed depressed by suspense and uncertainty
but he had not sat there more than a quarter of an hour when he suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere quite close
alyosha_karamazov suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer house the day before he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden seat among the bushes on the left by the fence
people were sitting or had only just sat down somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away the people must be sitting on it now
a man voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto accompanying himself on the guitar with invincible force i am bound to my dear
who were they lord have mercy on her and on me on her and on me on her and on me
another voice a woman suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully though with mincing affectation why havent you been to see us for so long pavel ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
the voice ceased it was a lackey tenor and a lackey song why do you always look down upon us not at all answered a man voice politely but with emphatic dignity
it was clear that the man had the best of the position and that the woman was making advances i believe the man must be smerdyakov thought alyosha_karamazov from his voice
and the lady must be the daughter of the house here who has come from moscow the one who wears the dress with a tail and goes to marfa for soup
i am awfully fond of verses of all kind if they rhyme the woman voice continued why dont you go on
the man sang again what do i care for royal wealth if but my dear one be in health lord have mercy on her and on me
on her and on me on her and on me it was even better last time observed the woman voice
you sang if my darling be in health it sounded more tender i suppose you ve forgotten to day poetry is rubbish said smerdyakov curtly
oh no i am very fond of poetry so far as it poetry it essential rubbish consider yourself who ever talks in rhyme
and if we were all to talk in rhyme even though it were decreed by government we shouldnt say much should we
poetry is no good marya_kondratyevna how clever you are how is it you ve gone so deep into everything
the woman voice was more and more insinuating i could have done better than that i could have known more than that if it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up
i would have shot a man in a duel if he called me names because i am descended from a filthy beggar and have no father_zossima
and they used to throw it in my teeth in moscow it had reached them from here thanks to grigory_vassilyevitch
grigory_vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my birth but i would have sanctioned their killing me before i was born that i might not have come into the world at all
they used to say in the market and your mamma too with great lack of delicacy set off telling me that her hair was like a mat on her head and that she was short of five foot by a wee bit
why talk of a wee bit while she might have said a little bit like every one else she wanted to make it touching a regular peasant feeling
can a russian peasant be said to feel in comparison with an educated man he cant be said to have feeling at all in his ignorance
from my childhood up when i hear a wee bit i am ready to burst with rage i hate all russia marya_kondratyevna
if you been a cadet in the army or a young hussar you wouldnt have talked like that but would have drawn your saber to defend all russia
i dont want to be a hussar marya_kondratyevna and what more i should like to abolish all soldiers
in there was a great invasion of russia by napoleon first emperor of the french father_zossima of the present one and it would have been a good thing if they had conquered us
and when an enemy comes who is going to defend us there no need of defense a clever nation would have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it
i wouldnt change a dandy i know of for three young englishmen observed marya_kondratyevna tenderly doubtless accompanying her words with a most languishing glance
we should have had quite different institutions are they so much better in their own country than we are that as one prefers
but you are just like a foreigner just like a most gentlemanly foreigner i tell you that though it makes me bashful
they are swindlers only there the scoundrel wears polished boots and here he grovels in filth and sees no harm in it
if you care to know the folks there and ours here are just alike in their vice the russian people want thrashing as fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov said very truly yesterday though he is mad and all his child
you said yourself you had such a respect for ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but he said i was a stinking lackey he thinks that i might be unruly
he is mistaken there if i had a certain sum in my pocket i would have left here long ago dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is lower than any lackey in his behavior in his mind and in his poverty
i may be only a soup maker but with luck i could open a café restaurant in petrovka in moscow for my cookery is something special and there no one in moscow except the foreigners whose cookery is anything special
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is a beggar but if he were to challenge the son of the first count in the country he fight him
he doesnt know how to do anything and yet he is respected by every one though in what way is he better than i am
for he is ever so much stupider than i am look at the money he has wasted without any need it must be lovely a duel marya_kondratyevna observed suddenly
it must be so dreadful and so brave especially when young officers with pistol in their hands pop at one another for the sake of some lady
how so a perfect picture ah if only girls were allowed to look on i give anything to see one
it all very well when you are firing at some one but when he is firing straight in your mug you must feel pretty silly
you be glad to run away marya_kondratyevna you dont mean you would run away but smerdyakov did not deign to reply
after a moment silence the guitar tinkled again and he sang again in the same falsetto whatever you may say i shall go far away
life will be bright and gay in the city far away i shall not grieve i shall not grieve at all i dont intend to grieve at all
then something unexpected happened alyosha_karamazov suddenly sneezed they were silent alyosha_karamazov got up and walked towards them he found smerdyakov dressed up and wearing polished boots his hair pomaded and perhaps curled
the guitar lay on the garden seat his companion was the daughter of the house wearing a light blue dress with a train two yards long
she was young and would not have been bad looking but that her face was so round and terribly freckled will my brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov soon be back asked alyosha_karamazov with as much composure as he could
smerdyakov got up slowly marya_kondratyevna rose too how am i to know about dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov it not as if i were his keeper answered smerdyakov quietly distinctly and superciliously
but i simply asked whether you do know alyosha_karamazov explained i know nothing of his whereabouts and dont want to
but my brother told me that you let him know all that goes on in the house and promised to let him know when agrafena_alexandrovna comes
smerdyakov turned a deliberate unmoved glance upon him and how did you get in this time since the gate was bolted an hour ago
he asked looking at alyosha_karamazov i came in from the back alley over the fence and went straight to the summer house
i hope you ll forgive me he added addressing marya_kondratyevna i was in a hurry to find my brother
ach as though we could take it amiss in you drawled marya_kondratyevna flattered by alyosha_karamazov apology for dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov often goes to the summer house in that way
we dont know he is here and he is sitting in the summer house i am very anxious to find him or to learn from you where he is now
though i used to come here as a friend smerdyakov began again dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has pestered me in a merciless way even here by his incessant questions about the master
believe me it on business of great importance to him he never tells us lisped marya_kondratyevna what news
he ll ask what going on in there now who coming and going and cant i tell him something more twice already he threatened me with death
with death alyosha_karamazov exclaimed in surprise do you suppose he think much of that with his temper which you had a chance of observing yourself yesterday
he says if i let agrafena_alexandrovna in and she passes the night there i ll be the first to suffer for it
i am terribly afraid of him and if i were not even more afraid of doing so i ought to let the police know
god only knows what he might not do his honor said to him the other day i ll pound you in a mortar added marya_kondratyevna
oh if it pounding in a mortar it may be only talk observed alyosha_karamazov if i could meet him i might speak to him about that too
well the only thing i can tell you is this said smerdyakov as though thinking better of it i am here as an old friend and neighbor and it would be odd if i didnt come
on the other hand ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov sent me first thing this morning to your brother lodging in lake street without a letter but with a message to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to go to dine with him at the restaurant here in the market place
i went but didnt find dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov at home though it was eight clock he been here but he is quite gone those were the very words of his landlady
perhaps at this moment he is in the restaurant with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov for ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has not been home to dinner and fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov dined alone an hour ago and is gone to lie down
but i beg you most particularly not to speak of me and of what i have told you for he kill me for nothing at all
it as though there was an understanding between them brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov invited dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov to the restaurant to day repeated alyosha_karamazov quickly
that so the metropolis tavern in the market place the very same that quite likely cried alyosha_karamazov much excited
thank you smerdyakov that important i ll go there at once dont betray me smerdyakov called after him oh no i ll go to the tavern as though by chance
dont be anxious but wait a minute i ll open the gate to you cried marya_kondratyevna no it a short cut i ll get over the fence again
it was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his monastic dress but he could inquire at the entrance for his brothers and call them down
but just as he reached the tavern a window was flung open and his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov called down to him from it
what he had heard threw alyosha_karamazov into great agitation he ran to the tavern alyosha_karamazov cant you come up here to me
i shall be awfully grateful to be sure i can only i dont quite know whether in this dress
but i am in a room apart come up the steps i ll run down to meet you a minute later alyosha_karamazov was sitting beside his brother
friends ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was not however in a separate room but only in a place shut off by a screen so that it was unseen by other people in the room
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was alone dining chapter iii the brothers make it was the first room from the entrance with a buffet along the wall
waiters were continually darting to and fro in it the only customer in the room was an old retired military man drinking tea in a corner
but there was the usual bustle going on in the other rooms of the tavern there were shouts for the waiters the sound of popping corks the click of billiard balls the drone of the organ
alyosha_karamazov knew that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov did not usually visit this tavern and disliked taverns in general so he must have come here he reflected simply to meet dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov by arrangement
yet dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was not there shall i order you fish soup or anything you dont live on tea alone i suppose cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov apparently delighted at having got hold of alyosha_karamazov
he had finished dinner and was drinking tea let me have soup and tea afterwards i am hungry said alyosha_karamazov gayly
and cherry jam they have it here you remember how you used to love cherry jam when you were little
you remember that let me have jam too i like it still ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov rang for the waiter and ordered soup jam and tea
i remember everything alyosha_karamazov i remember you till you were eleven i was nearly fifteen there such a difference between fifteen and eleven that brothers are never companions at those ages
i dont know whether i was fond of you even when i went away to moscow for the first few years i never thought of you at all
and now i ve been here more than three months and so far we have scarcely said a word to each other
to morrow i am going away and i was just thinking as i sat here how i could see you to say good by
then when you came to moscow yourself we only met once somewhere i believe and just then you passed were you very anxious to see me then
very i want to get to know you once for all and i want you to know me and then to say good by
i believe it always best to get to know people just before leaving them i ve noticed how you ve been looking at me these three months
there has been a continual look of expectation in your eye and i cant endure that that how it is i ve kept away from you
but in the end i have learned to respect you the little man stands firm i thought though i am laughing i am serious
you do stand firm dont you i like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by even if they are such little fellows as you
your expectant eye ceased to annoy me i grew fond of them in the end those expectant eye you seem to love me for some reason alyosha_karamazov
i do love you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov says of you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is a tomb i say of you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is a riddle
you are a riddle to me even now but i understand something in you and i did not understand it till this morning
that you are just as young as other young man of three and twenty that you are just a young and fresh and nice boy green in fact
what that laughed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you wont be angry alyosha_karamazov laughed too well now have i insulted you dreadfully
would you believe it that ever since that scene with her i have thought of nothing else but my youthful greenness and just as though you guessed that you begin about it
do you know i ve been sitting here thinking to myself that if i didnt believe in life if i lost faith in the woman i love lost faith in the order of things were convinced in fact that everything is a disorderly damnable and perhaps devil ridden chaos if i were struck by every horror of man disillusionment still i should want to live and having once tasted of the cup i would not turn away from it till i had drained it
at thirty though i shall be sure to leave the cup even if i ve not emptied it and turn away where i dont know
on the contrary i am struck by a coincidence cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov warmly and good humoredly but till i am thirty i know that my youth will triumph over everything every disillusionment every disgust with life
i ve asked myself many time whether there is in the world any despair that would overcome this frantic and perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me and i ve come to the conclusion that there isnt that is till i am thirty and then i shall lose it of myself
it a feature of the karamazovs it true that thirst for life regardless of everything you have it no doubt too but why is it base
i fancy some driveling consumptive moralists and poets especially often call that thirst for life base the centripetal force on our planet is still fearfully strong alyosha_karamazov
though i may not believe in the order of the universe yet i love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring
i have a longing for life and i go on living in spite of logic i love the blue sky i love some people whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why
i love some great deeds done by man though i ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them yet from old habit one heart prizes them
here they have brought the soup for you eat it it will do you good it first rate soup they know how to make it here
i want to travel in europe alyosha_karamazov i shall set off from here and yet i know that i am only going to a graveyard but it a most precious graveyard
precious are the dead that lie there every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past of such passionate faith in their work their truth their struggle and their science that i know i shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and weep over them though i convinced in my heart that it long been nothing but a graveyard
and i shall not weep from despair but simply because i shall be happy in my tears i shall steep my soul in my emotion
that what it is i love the sticky leaves in spring the blue sky that all it is it not a matter of intellect or logic it loving with one inside with one stomach
one loves the first strength of one youth do you understand anything of my tirade alyosha_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov laughed suddenly i understand too well ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
one longs to love with one inside with one stomach you said that so well and i am awfully glad that you have such a longing for life cried alyosha_karamazov
i think every one should love life above everything in the world love life more than the meaning of it
certainly love it regardless of logic as you say it must be regardless of logic and it only then one will understand the meaning of it
half your work is done ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you love life now you ve only to try to do the second half and you are saved
i have thought so a long time you are trying to save me but perhaps i am not lost and what does your second half mean
why one has to raise up your dead who perhaps have not died after all come let me have tea i am so glad of our talk ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
i see you are feeling inspired i am awfully fond of such professions de foi from such novices you are a steadfast person alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov
is it true that you mean to leave the monastery yes my elder sends me out into the world we shall see each other then in the world
father_zossima doesnt want to turn aside from his cup till he is seventy he dreams of hanging on to eighty in fact so he says
we shall meet before i am thirty when i shall begin to turn aside from the cup he means it only too seriously though he is a buffoon
he stands on a firm rock too he stands on his sensuality though after we are thirty indeed there may be nothing else to stand on
but to hang on to seventy is nasty better only to thirty one might retain a shadow of nobility by deceiving oneself
have you seen dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov to day no but i saw smerdyakov and alyosha_karamazov rapidly though minutely described his meeting with smerdyakov
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov began listening anxiously and questioned him but he begged me not to tell dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov that he had told me about him added alyosha_karamazov
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov frowned and pondered are you frowning on smerdyakov account asked alyosha_karamazov yes on his account damn him i certainly did want to see dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov but now there no need said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov reluctantly
but are you really going so soon brother yes what of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and father_zossima how will it end asked alyosha_karamazov anxiously
you are always harping upon it what have i to do with it am i my brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov keeper ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov snapped irritably but then he suddenly smiled bitterly
cain answer about his murdered brother wasnt it perhaps that what you re thinking at this moment well damn it all i cant stay here to be their keeper
do you imagine i am jealous of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov that i ve been trying to steal his beautiful katerina_ivanovna for the last three months
can i i ve finished what i had to do and i am going nonsense i had business of my own
i finished it i am going i finished it just now you were witness at katerina_ivanovna yes and i ve released myself once for all
and after all what have i to do with dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov dmitri doesnt come in i had my own business to settle with katerina_ivanovna
you know on the contrary that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov behaved as though there was an understanding between us i didnt ask him to do it but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing
would you believe it i sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom
it all too funny ah alyosha_karamazov if you only knew how light my heart is now tfoo it been going on nearly six months and all at once i ve thrown it off
i could never have guessed even yesterday how easy it would be to put an end to it if i wanted
you are speaking of your love ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov of my love if you like i fell in love with the young lady i worried myself over her
and she worried me i sat watching over her and all at once it collapsed i spoke this morning with inspiration but i went away and roared with laughter
would you believe it yes it the literal truth you seem very merry about it now observed alyosha_karamazov looking into his face which had suddenly grown brighter
but how could i tell that i didnt care for her a bit ha ha it appears after all i didnt
and yet how she attracted me how attractive she was just now when i made my speech and do you know she attracts me awfully even now yet how easy it is to leave her
do you think i am boasting no only perhaps it wasnt love alyosha_karamazov laughed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dont make reflections about love it unseemly for you
how you rushed into the discussion this morning i ve forgotten to kiss you for it but how she tormented me it certainly was sitting by a laceration
ah she knew how i loved her she loved me and not dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov insisted gayly her feeling for dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was simply a self laceration
all i told her just now was perfectly true but the worst of it is it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find out that she doesnt care for dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and loves me whom she torments and perhaps she may never find it out at all in spite of her lesson to day
well it better so i can simply go away for good by the way how is she now what happened after i departed
alyosha_karamazov told him she had been hysterical and that she was now he heard unconscious and delirious isnt madame_hohlakov laying it on
i think not i must find out nobody dies of hysterics though they dont matter god gave woman hysterics as a relief
i wont go to her at all why push myself forward again but you told her that she had never cared for you
i did that on purpose alyosha_karamazov shall i call for some champagne let us drink to my freedom ah if only you knew how glad i am
no brother we had better not drink said alyosha_karamazov suddenly besides i feel somehow depressed yes you ve been depressed a long time i ve noticed it
have you settled to go to morrow morning then morning i didnt say i should go in the morning but perhaps it may be the morning
would you believe it i dined here to day only to avoid dining with the old man i loathe him so i should have left long ago so far as he is concerned
but why are you so worried about my going away we ve plenty of time before i go an eternity if you are going away to morrow what do you mean by an eternity
but what does it matter to us laughed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov we ve time enough for our talk for what brought us here
to talk of my love for katerina_ivanovna of the old man and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov of foreign travel of the fatal position of russia
why do you look so surprised answer why have we met here of the emperor napoleon is that it no
then you know what for it different for other people but we in our green youth have to settle the eternal questions first of all
that what we care about young russia is talking about nothing but the eternal questions now just when the old folks are all taken up with practical questions
why have you been looking at me in expectation for the last three months to ask me what do you believe or dont you believe at all
that what your eye have been meaning for these three months havent they perhaps so smiled alyosha_karamazov you are not laughing at me now ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
me laughing i dont want to wound my little brother who has been watching me with such expectation for three months
alyosha_karamazov look straight at me of course i am just such a little boy as you are only not a novice
and what have russian boys been doing up till now some of them i mean in this stinking tavern for instance here they meet and sit down in a corner
they ve never met in their lives before and when they go out of the tavern they wont meet again for forty years
and what do they talk about in that momentary halt in the tavern of the eternal questions of the existence of god and immortality
and those who do not believe in god talk of socialism or anarchism of the transformation of all humanity on a new pattern so that it all comes to the same
they re the same questions turned inside out and masses masses of the most original russian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal questions
yes for real russians the questions of god existence and of immortality or as you say the same questions turned inside out come first and foremost of course and so they should said alyosha_karamazov still watching his brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile
well alyosha_karamazov it sometimes very unwise to be a russian at all but anything stupider than the way russian boys spend their time one can hardly imagine
isnt it so but there one russian boy called alyosha_karamazov i am awfully fond of how nicely you put that in
alyosha_karamazov laughed suddenly well tell me where to begin give your orders the existence of god eh begin where you like
you declared yesterday at father_zossima that there was no god alyosha_karamazov looked searchingly at his brother i said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you
and i saw your eye glow but now i ve no objection to discussing with you and i say so very seriously
i want to be friends with you alyosha_karamazov for i have no friends and want to try it well only fancy perhaps i too accept god laughed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that a surprise for you isnt it
yes of course if you are not joking now joking i was told at the elder yesterday that i was joking
you know dear boy there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century who declared that if there were no god he would have to be invented
and what strange what would be marvelous is not that god should really exist the marvel is that such an idea the idea of the necessity of god could enter the head of such a savage vicious beast as man
s il existait pas dieu il faudrait inventer and man has actually invented god so holy it is so touching so wise and so great a credit it does to man
and i wont go through all the axioms laid down by russian boys on that subject all derived from european hypotheses for what a hypothesis there is an axiom with the russian boy and not only with the boys but with their teachers too for our russian professors are often just the same boys themselves
as for me i ve long resolved not to think whether man created god or god man and so i omit all the hypotheses
i am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature that is what manner of man i am what i believe in and for what i hope that it isnt it
but you must note this if god exists and if he really did create the world then as we all know he created it according to the geometry of euclid and the human mind with the conception of only three dimensions in space
yet there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers and even some of the most distinguished who doubt whether the whole universe or to speak more widely the whole of being was only created in euclid geometry they even dare to dream that two parallel lines which according to euclid can never meet on earth may meet somewhere in infinity
for what are we aiming at now and therefore i tell you that i accept god simply i have come to the conclusion that since i cant understand even that i cant expect to understand about god
i acknowledge humbly that i have no faculty for settling such questions i have a euclidian earthly mind and how could i solve problems that are not of this world
and i advise you never to think about it either my dear alyosha_karamazov especially about god whether he exists or not
and so i accept god and am glad to and what more i accept his wisdom his purpose which are utterly beyond our ken i believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life i believe in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day be blended
i believe in the word to which the universe is striving and which itself was with god and which itself is god and so on and so on to infinity
all such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions there are all sort of phrases for it
yet would you believe it in the final result i dont accept this world of god and although i know it exists i dont accept it at all
i seem to be on the right path dont i it not that i dont accept god you must understand it the world created by him
i believe like a child that suffering will be healed and made up for that all the humiliating absurdity of human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage like the despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small euclidian mind of man that in the world finale at the moment of eternal harmony something so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all hearts for the comforting of all resentments for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity of all the blood they ve shed that it will make it not only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened with man but though all that may come to pass i dont accept it
i dont and cannot accept let me make it plain i wont accept it even if parallel lines do meet and i see it myself
i shall see it and say that they ve met but still i wont accept it that what at the root of me alyosha_karamazov that my creed
i began our talk as stupidly as i could on purpose but i ve led up to my confession for that all you want
i am in earnest in what i say you didnt want to hear about god but only to know what the brother you love lives by
and so i ve told you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov concluded his long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling and why did you begin as stupidly as you could
asked alyosha_karamazov looking dreamily at him to begin with for the sake of being russian russian conversation on such subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly
and secondly the stupider one is the closer one is to reality the stupider one is the clearer one is stupidity is brief and artless while intelligence wriggles and hides itself
intelligence is a knave but stupidity is honest and straightforward i ve led the conversation to my despair and the more stupidly i have presented it the better for me
you will explain why you dont accept the world said alyosha_karamazov to be sure i will it not a secret that what i ve been leading up to
dear little brother i dont want to corrupt you or to turn you from your stronghold perhaps i want to be healed by you
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov smiled suddenly quite like a little gentle child alyosha_karamazov had never seen such a smile on his face before
chapter iv rebellion i must make you one confession ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov began i could never understand how one can love one neighbors
i once read somewhere of john the merciful a saint that when a hungry frozen beggar came to him he took him into his bed held him in his arms and began breathing into his mouth which was putrid and loathsome from some awful disease
i am convinced that he did that from self laceration from the self laceration of falsity for the sake of the charity imposed by duty as a penance laid on him
for any one to love a man he must be hidden for as soon as he shows his face love is gone
father_zossima has talked of that more than once observed alyosha_karamazov he too said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practiced in love from loving him
it just one neighbors to my mind that one cant love though one might love those at a distance but yet there a great deal of love in mankind and almost church_of_christ like love
well i know nothing of it so far and cant understand it and the innumerable mass of mankind are with me there
i know that myself ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov the question is whether that due to man bad qualities or whether it inherent in their nature
to my thinking church_of_christ like love for man is a miracle impossible on earth he was god but we are not gods
suppose i for instance suffer intensely another can never know how much i suffer because he is another and not i_
and what more a man is rarely ready to admit another suffering as though it were a distinction why wont he admit it do you think
besides there is suffering and suffering degrading humiliating suffering such as humbles me hunger for instance my benefactor will perhaps allow me but when you come to higher suffering for an idea for instance he will very rarely admit that perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what he fancy a man should have who suffers for an idea
because i smell unpleasant because i have a stupid face because i once trod on his foot and so he deprives me instantly of his favor and not at all from badness of heart
beggars especially genteel beggars ought never to show themselves but to ask for charity through the newspapers one can love one neighbors in the abstract or even at a distance but at close quarters it almost impossible
if it were as on the stage in the ballet where if beggars come in they wear silken rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully then one might like looking at them
but even then we should not love them but enough of that i simply wanted to show you my point of view
i meant to speak of the suffering of mankind generally but we had better confine ourselves to the sufferings of the child
that reduces the scope of my argument to a tenth of what it would be still we better keep to the child though it does weaken my case
but in the first place child can be loved even at close quarters even when they are dirty even when they are ugly i fancy though child never are ugly
the second reason why i wont speak of grown up people is that besides being disgusting and unworthy of love they have a compensation
they ve eaten the apple and know good and evil and they have become like gods they go on eating it still
but the child havent eaten anything and are so far innocent are you fond of child alyosha_karamazov i know you are and you will understand why i prefer to speak of them
if they too suffer horribly on earth they must suffer for their fathers sins they must be punished for their fathers who have eaten the apple but that reasoning is of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here on earth
the innocent must not suffer for another sins and especially such innocents you may be surprised at me alyosha_karamazov but i am awfully fond of child too
child while they are quite little up to seven for instance are so remote from grown up people they are different creatures as it were of a different species
i knew a criminal in prison who had in the course of his career as a burglar murdered whole families including several child
and observe cruel people the violent the rapacious the karamazovs are sometimes very fond of child but when he was in prison he had a strange affection for them
he spent all his time at his window watching the child playing in the prison yard he trained one little boy to come up to his window and made great friends with him
you dont know why i am telling you all this alyosha_karamazov my head aches and i am sad you speak with a strange air observed alyosha_karamazov uneasily as though you were not quite yourself
by the way a bulgarian i met lately in moscow ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went on seeming not to hear his brother words told me about the crimes committed by turks and circassians in all parts of bulgaria through fear of a general rising of the slavs
they burn villages murder outrage women and child they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences leave them so till morning and in the morning they hang them all sort of things you cant imagine
people talk sometimes of bestial cruelty but that a great injustice and insult to the beasts a beast can never be so cruel as a man so artistically cruel
the tiger only tears and gnaws that all he can do he would never think of nailing people by the ears even if he were able to do it
these turks took a pleasure in torturing child too cutting the unborn child from the mother womb and tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before their mothers eye
doing it before the mothers eye was what gave zest to the amusement here is another scene that i thought very interesting
imagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms a circle of invading turks around her they ve planned a diversion they pet the baby laugh to make it laugh
the baby laughs with glee holds out its little hands to the pistol and he pulls the trigger in the baby face and blows out its brains
they succeed the baby laughs at that moment a turk points a pistol four inches from the baby face artistic wasnt it
by the way turks are particularly fond of sweet things they say brother what are you driving at asked alyosha_karamazov
i think if the devil doesnt exist but man has created him he has created him in his own image and likeness
just as he did god then observed alyosha_karamazov it wonderful how you can turn words as polonius says in hamlet laughed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
you turn my words against me well i am glad yours must be a fine god if man created him in his image and likeness
you see i am fond of collecting certain facts and would you believe i even copy anecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and book and i ve already got a fine collection
you asked just now what i was driving at the turks of course have gone into it but they are foreigners
i have specimens from home that are even better than the turks you know we prefer beating rods and scourges that our national institution
nailing ears is unthinkable for us for we are after all europeans but the rod and the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be taken from us
abroad now they scarcely do any beating manners are more humane or laws have been passed so that they dont dare to flog man now
and so national that it would be practically impossible among us though i believe we are being inoculated with it since the religious movement began in our aristocracy
i have a charming pamphlet translated from the french describing how quite recently five years ago a murderer richard was executed a young man i believe of three and twenty who repented and was converted to the christian faith at the very scaffold
this richard was an illegitimate child who was given as a child of six by his parents to some shepherds on the swiss mountains
but they make up for it in another way just as national as ours they brought him up to work for them
the shepherds taught him nothing and scarcely fed or clothed him but sent him out at seven to herd the flock in cold and wet and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him so
quite the contrary they thought they had every right for richard had been given to them as a chattel and they did not even see the necessity of feeding him
richard himself describes how in those years like the prodigal son in the gospel he longed to eat of the mash given to the pigs which were fattened for sale
he grew up like a little wild beast among them but they wouldnt even give him that and beat him when he stole from the pigs
and that was how he spent all his childhood and his youth till he grew up and was strong enough to go away and be a thief
the savage began to earn his living as a day laborer in geneva he drank what he earned he lived like a brute and finished by killing and robbing an old man
he was caught tried and condemned to death they are not sentimentalists there and in prison he was immediately surrounded by pastors members of christian brotherhoods philanthropic lady and the like
they taught him to read and write in prison and expounded the gospel to him they exhorted him worked upon him drummed at him incessantly till at last he solemnly confessed his crime
he wrote to the court himself that he was a monster but that in the end god had vouchsafed him light and shown grace
all the aristocratic and well bred society of the town rushed to the prison kissed richard and embraced him you are our brother you have found grace
he was converted all geneva was in excitement about him all philanthropic and religious geneva and richard does nothing but weep with emotion yes i ve found grace
all my youth and childhood i was glad of pigs food but now even i have found grace i am dying in the lord
though it not your fault that you knew not the lord when you coveted the pigs food and were beaten for stealing it which was very wrong of you for stealing is forbidden but you ve shed blood and you must die
and on the last day richard perfectly limp did nothing but cry and repeat every minute this is my happiest day
yes richard die in the lord you have shed blood and must die i am going to the lord yes cry the pastors and the judges and philanthropic lady
this is the happiest day of your life for you are going to the lord they all walk or drive to the scaffold in procession behind the prison van
at the scaffold they call to richard die brother die in the lord for even thou hast found grace and so covered with his brothers kisses richard is dragged on to the scaffold and led to the guillotine
that pamphlet is translated into russian by some russian philanthropists of aristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations and has been distributed gratis for the enlightenment of the people
and they chopped off his head in brotherly fashion because he had found grace yes that characteristic the case of richard is interesting because it national
though to us it absurd to cut off a man head because he has become our brother and has found grace yet we have our own speciality which is all but worse
there are lines in nekrassov describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eye on its meek eye every one must have seen it
our historical pastime is the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain it peculiarly russian he describes how a feeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot move
the peasant beats it beats it savagely beats it at last not knowing what he is doing in the intoxication of cruelty thrashes it mercilessly over and over again
however weak you are you must pull if you die for it the nag strains and then he begins lashing the poor defenseless creature on its weeping on its meek eye
the frantic beast tugs and draws the load trembling all over gasping for breath moving sideways with a sort of unnatural spasmodic action it awful in nekrassov
but that only a horse and god has given horses to be beaten so the tatars have taught us and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it
but man too can be beaten a well educated cultured gentleman and his wife beat their own child with a birch rod a girl of seven
i have an exact account of it the papa was glad that the birch was covered with twigs it stings more said he and so he began stinging his daughter
i know for a fact there are people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality to literal sensuality which increases progressively at every blow they inflict
they beat for a minute for five minutes for ten minutes more often and more savagely the child screams at last the child cannot scream it gasps daddy
daddy by some diabolical unseemly chance the case was brought into court a counsel is engaged the russian people have long called a barrister a conscience for hire
the counsel protests in his client defense it such a simple thing he says an everyday domestic event a father_zossima corrects his child
to our shame be it said it is brought into court the jury convinced by him give a favorable verdict the public roars with delight that the torturer is acquitted
ah pity i wasnt there i would have proposed to raise a subscription in his honor charming pictures but i ve still better things about child
there was a little girl of five who was hated by her father_zossima and mother most worthy and respectable people of good education and breeding
you see i must repeat again it is a peculiar characteristic of many people this love of torturing child and child only
to all other types of humanity these torturers behave mildly and benevolently like cultivated and humane europeans but they are very fond of tormenting child even fond of child themselves in that sense
it just their defenselessness that tempts the tormentor just the angelic confidence of the child who has no refuge and no appeal that sets his vile blood on fire
in every man of course a demon lies hidden the demon of rage the demon of lustful heat at the screams of the tortured victim the demon of lawlessness let off the chain the demon of diseases that follow on vice gout kidney disease and so on
i ve collected a great great deal about russian child alyosha_karamazov this poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those cultivated parents
then they went to greater refinements of cruelty shut her up all night in the cold and frost in a privy and because she didnt ask to be taken up at night as though a child of five sleeping its angelic sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask they smeared her face and filled her mouth with excrement and it was her mother
they beat her thrashed her kicked her for no reason till her body was one bruise her mother did this and that mother could sleep hearing the poor child groans
can you understand why a little creature who cant even understand what done to her should beat her little aching heart with her tiny fist in the dark and the cold and weep her meek unresentful tears to dear kind god to protect her
do you understand that friend and brother you pious and humble novice do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted
without it i am told man could not have existed on earth for he could not have known good and evil
why should he know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much why the whole world of knowledge is not worth that child prayer to dear kind god
i say nothing of the sufferings of grown up people they have eaten the apple damn them and the devil take them all
but these little ones i am making you suffer alyosha_karamazov you are not yourself i ll leave off if you like never mind
one picture only one more because it so curious so characteristic and i have only just read it in some collection of russian antiquities
it was in the darkest day of serfdom at the beginning of the century and long live the liberator of the people
there was in those day a general of aristocratic connections the owner of great estates one of those man somewhat exceptional i believe even then who retiring from the service into a life of leisure are convinced that they ve earned absolute power over the lives of their subjects
i want to suffer too muttered alyosha_karamazov i ve forgotten the name i must look it up there were such man then
so our general settled on his property of two thousand soul lives in pomp and domineers over his poor neighbors as though they were dependents and buffoons
one day a serf boy a little child of eight threw a stone in play and hurt the paw of the general favorite hound
he has kennels of hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog boys all mounted and in uniform why is my favorite dog lame
he is told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog paw so you did it the general looked the child up and down
early that morning the general comes out on horseback with the hounds his dependents dog boys and huntsmen all mounted around him in full hunting parade
take him he was taken taken from his mother and kept shut up all night the servants are summoned for their edification and in front of them all stands the mother of the child
the child is brought from the lock up it a gloomy cold foggy autumn day a capital day for hunting the general orders the child to be undressed the child is stripped naked
he shivers numb with terror not daring to cry make him run commands the general run run shout the dog boys
the boy runs at him yells the general and he sets the whole pack of hounds on the child the hounds catch him and tear him to pieces before his mother eye
i believe the general was afterwards declared incapable of administering his estates well what did he deserve to be shot to be shot for the satisfaction of our moral feeling
speak alyosha_karamazov to be shot murmured alyosha_karamazov lifting his eye to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a pale twisted smile bravo cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov delighted
if even you say so you re a pretty monk so there is a little devil sitting in your heart alyosha_karamazov
what i said was absurd but that just the point that but cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov let me tell you novice that the absurd is only too necessary on earth
the world stands on absurdities and perhaps nothing would have come to pass in it without them we know what we know
what do you know i understand nothing ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went on as though in delirium i dont want to understand anything now
if i try to understand anything i shall be false to the fact and i have determined to stick to the fact
i want to stick to the fact i made up my mind long ago not to understand why are you trying me
alyosha_karamazov cried with sudden distress will you say what you mean at last of course i will that what i ve been leading up to
you are dear to me i dont want to let you go and i wont give you up to your father_zossima
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov for a minute was silent his face became all at once very sad listen i took the case of child only to make my case clearer
of the other tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked from its crust to its center i will say nothing
i am a bug and i recognize in all humility that i cannot understand why the world is arranged as it is
man are themselves to blame i suppose they were given paradise they wanted freedom and stole fire from heaven though they knew they would become unhappy so there is no need to pity them
with my pitiful earthly euclidian understanding all i know is that there is suffering and that there are none guilty that cause follows effect simply and directly that everything flows and finds its level but that only euclidian nonsense i know that and i cant consent to live by it
what comfort is it to me that there are none guilty and that cause follows effect simply and directly and that i know it i must have justice or i will destroy myself
i have narrowed my subject on purpose and not justice in some remote infinite time and space but here on earth and that i could see myself
i want to see it and if i am dead by then let me rise again for if it all happens without me it will be too unfair
surely i havent suffered simply that i my crimes and my sufferings may manure the soil of the future harmony for somebody else
i want to see with my own eye the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrace his murderer
i have believed in it i want to be there when every one suddenly understands what it has all been for
all the religions of the world are built on this longing and i am a believer but then there are the child and what am i to do about them
for the hundredth time i repeat there are numbers of questions but i ve only taken the child because in their case what i mean is so unanswerably clear
that a question i cant answer listen if all must suffer to pay for the eternal harmony what have child to do with it tell me please
it beyond all comprehension why they should suffer and why they should pay for the harmony why should they too furnish material to enrich the soil for the harmony of the future
i understand solidarity in sin among man i understand solidarity in retribution too but there can be no such solidarity with child
and if it is really true that they must share responsibility for all their fathers crimes such a truth is not of this world and is beyond my comprehension
some jester will say perhaps that the child would have grown up and have sinned but you see he didnt grow up he was torn to pieces by the dogs at eight years old
i understand of course what an upheaval of the universe it will be when everything in heaven and earth blends in one hymn of praise and everything that lives and has lived cries aloud thou art just lord for thy ways are revealed
when the mother embraces the fiend who threw her child to the dogs and all three cry aloud with tears thou art just lord
oh alyosha_karamazov i am not blaspheming then of course the crown of knowledge will be reached and all will be made clear
but what pulls me up here is that i cant accept that harmony and while i am on earth i make haste to take my own measures
you see alyosha_karamazov perhaps it really may happen that if i live to that moment or rise again to see it i too perhaps may cry aloud with the rest looking at the mother embracing the child torturer thou art just lord
but i dont want to cry aloud then while there is still time i hasten to protect myself and so i renounce the higher harmony altogether
it not worth the tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse with its unexpiated tears to dear kind god
it not worth it because those tears are unatoned for they must be atoned for or there can be no harmony
but how how are you going to atone for them is it possible by their being avenged but what do i care for avenging them
what do i care for a hell for oppressors what good can hell do since those child have already been tortured
and what becomes of harmony if there is hell i want to forgive i want to embrace i dont want more suffering
and if the sufferings of child go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth then i protest that the truth is not worth such a price
i dont want the mother to embrace the oppressor who threw her son to the dogs she dare not forgive him
let her forgive him for herself if she will let her forgive the torturer for the immeasurable suffering of her mother heart
but the sufferings of her tortured child she has no right to forgive she dare not forgive the torturer even if the child were to forgive him
and if that is so if they dare not forgive what becomes of harmony is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive
i dont want harmony from love for humanity i dont want it i would rather be left with the unavenged suffering
besides too high a price is asked for harmony it beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it
and so i hasten to give back my entrance ticket and if i am an honest man i am bound to give it back as soon as possible
i would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation even if i were wrong and that i am doing
it not god that i dont accept alyosha_karamazov only i most respectfully return him the ticket that rebellion murmured alyosha_karamazov looking down
rebellion i am sorry you call it that said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov earnestly one can hardly live in rebellion and i want to live
imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making man happy in the end giving them peace and rest at last but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature that baby beating its breast with its fist for instance and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears would you consent to be the architect on those conditions
tell me yourself i challenge you answer tell me and tell the truth no i wouldnt consent said alyosha_karamazov softly
and can you admit the idea that man for whom you are building it would agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated blood of a little victim
brother said alyosha_karamazov suddenly with flashing eye you said just now is there a being in the whole world who would have the right to forgive and could forgive
and accepting it would remain happy for ever no i cant admit it but there is a being and he can forgive everything all and for all because he gave his innocent blood for all and everything
you have forgotten him and on him is built the edifice and it is to him they cry aloud thou art just lord for thy ways are revealed
no i have not forgotten him on the contrary i ve been wondering all the time how it was you did not bring him in before for usually all arguments on your side put him in the foreground
ah the one without sin and his blood do you know alyosha_karamazov dont laugh i made a poem about a year ago
if you can waste another ten minutes on me i ll tell it to you you wrote a poem oh no i didnt write it laughed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and i ve never written two lines of poetry in my life
but i made up this poem in prose and i remembered it i was carried away when i made it up
you will be my first reader that is listener why should an author forego even one listener smiled ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov shall i tell it to you
i am all attention said alyosha_karamazov my poem is called the grand inquisitor it a ridiculous thing but i want to tell it to you
the grand inquisitor even this must have a preface that is a literary preface laughed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and i am a poor hand at making one
you see my action takes place in the sixteenth century and at that time as you probably learnt at school it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth
not to speak of dante in france clerks as well as the monks in the monasteries used to give regular performances in which the madonna the saints the angels church_of_christ and god himself were brought on the stage
in victor hugo notre dame de paris an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the hôtel de ville of paris in the reign of louis xi
chapter in those day it was done in all simplicity in honor of the birth of the dauphin it was called le bon jugement
de la trčs sainte et gracieuse vierge marie and she appears herself on the stage and pronounces her bon jugement
similar plays chiefly from the old testament were occasionally performed in moscow too up to the time of peter the great
but besides plays there were all sort of legends and ballads scattered about the world in which the saints and angels and all the powers of heaven took part when required
there is for instance one such poem of course from the greek the wanderings of our lady through hell with descriptions as bold as dante
in our monasteries the monks busied themselves in translating copying and even composing such poems and even under the tatars our lady visits hell and the archangel michael leads her through the torments
there she sees among others one noteworthy set of sinners in a burning lake some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that they cant swim out and these god forgets an expression of extraordinary depth and force
and so our lady shocked and weeping falls before the throne of god and begs for mercy for all in hell for all she has seen there indiscriminately
she beseeches him she will not desist and when god points to the hands and feet of her son nailed to the cross and asks how can i forgive his tormentors
she bids all the saints all the martyrs all the angels and archangels to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all without distinction
it ends by her winning from god a respite of suffering every year from good friday till trinity day and the sinners at once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell chanting
she sees the sinners and their punishment her conversation with god is immensely interesting thou art just lord in this judgment
well my poem would have been of that kind if it had appeared at that time he comes on the scene in my poem but he says nothing only appears and passes on
fifteen centuries since his prophet wrote behold i come quickly of that day and that hour knoweth no man neither the son but the father_zossima as he himself predicted on earth
fifteen centuries have passed since he promised to come in his glory but humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love
oh with greater faith for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to see signs from heaven no signs from heaven come to day
to add to what the heart doth say there was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say it is true there were many miracles in those day
there were saints who performed miraculous cures some holy people according to their biographies were visited by the queen of heaven herself
but the devil did not slumber and doubts were already arising among man of the truth of these miracles and just then there appeared in the north of germany a terrible new heresy
a huge star like to a torch that is to a church_of_christ fell on the sources of the waters and they became bitter
these heretics began blasphemously denying miracles but those who remained faithful were all the more ardent in their faith
the tears of humanity rose up to him as before awaited his coming loved him hoped for him yearned to suffer and die for him as before
thy coming so many ages called upon him that in his infinite mercy he deigned to come down to his servants
before that day he had come down he had visited some holy man martyrs and hermits as is written in their lives
among us tyutchev with absolute faith in the truth of his words bore witness that bearing the cross in slavish dress weary and worn the heavenly king our mother russia came to bless and through our land went wandering
and so many ages mankind had prayed with faith and fervor lord our god hasten and that certainly was so i assure you
and behold he deigned to appear for a moment to the people to the tortured suffering people sunk in iniquity but loving him like child
my story is laid in spain in seville in the most terrible time of the inquisition when fires were lighted every day to the glory of god and in the splendid auto da fé the wicked heretics were burnt
oh of course this was not the coming in which he will appear according to his promise at the end of time in all his heavenly glory and which will be sudden as lightning flashing from east to west
in his infinite mercy he came once more among man in that human shape in which he walked among man for three years fifteen centuries ago
he came down to the hot pavements of the southern town in which on the day before almost a hundred heretics had ad majorem gloriam dei been burnt by the cardinal the grand inquisitor in a magnificent auto da fé in the presence of the king the court the knights the cardinals the most charming lady of the court and the whole population of seville
no he visited his child only for a moment and there where the flames were crackling round the heretics
he came softly unobserved and yet strange to say every one recognized him that might be one of the best passages in the poem
i mean why they recognized him the people are irresistibly drawn to him they surround him they flock about him follow him
the sun of love burns in his heart light and power shine from his eye and their radiance shed on the people stirs their hearts with responsive love
he holds out his hands to them blesses them and a healing virtue comes from contact with him even with his garments
he moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile of infinite compassion an old man in the crowd blind from childhood cries out lord heal me and i shall see thee
and as it were scales fall from his eye and the blind man sees him the crowd weeps and kisses the earth under his feet
child throw flowers before him sing and cry hosannah it is he it is he all repeat it must be he
he stops at the steps of the seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin
it can be no one but him in it lies a child of seven the only daughter of a prominent citizen
the priest coming to meet the coffin looks perplexed and frowns but the mother of the dead child throws herself at his feet with a wail
the dead child lies hidden in flowers he will raise your child the crowd shouts to the weeping mother if it is thou raise my child
she cries holding out her hands to him the procession halts the coffin is laid on the steps at his feet
the little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round smiling with wide open wondering eye holding a bunch of white roses they had put in her hand
there are cries sobs confusion among the people and at that moment the cardinal himself the grand inquisitor passes by the cathedral
he is an old man almost ninety tall and erect with a withered face and sunken eye in which there is still a gleam of light
he is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal robes as he was the day before when he was burning the enemies of the roman church_of_christ at this moment he is wearing his coarse old monk cassock
he looks with compassion and his lips once more softly pronounce maiden arise and the maiden arises at a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and slaves and the holy guard
he sees everything he sees them set the coffin down at his feet sees the child rise up and his face darkens
he stops at the sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance he knits his thick gray brows and his eye gleam with a sinister fire
and such is his power so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on him and lead him away
he holds out his finger and bids the guards take him the crowd instantly bows down to the earth like one man before the old inquisitor
the guards lead their prisoner to the close gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the holy inquisition and shut him in it
he blesses the people in silence and passes on the day passes and is followed by the dark burning breathless night of seville
in the pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and the grand inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his hand
the air is fragrant with laurel and lemon he is alone the door is closed at once behind him he stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into his face
at last he goes up slowly sets the light on the table and speaks is it thou thou but receiving no answer he adds at once dont answer be silent
what canst thou say indeed i know too well what thou wouldst say and thou hast no right to add anything to what thou hadst said of old
why then art thou come to hinder us for thou hast come to hinder us and thou knowest that but dost thou know what will be to morrow
thou art and care not to know whether it is thou or only a semblance of him but to morrow i shall condemn thee and burn thee at the stake as the worst of heretics
and the very people who have to day kissed thy feet to morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of thy fire
i know not who knowest thou that yes maybe thou knowest it he added with thoughtful penetration never for a moment taking his eye off the prisoner
i dont quite understand ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov what does it mean alyosha_karamazov who had been listening in silence said with a smile
take it as the last said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov laughing if you are so corrupted by modern realism and cant stand anything fantastic
is it simply a wild fantasy or a mistake on the part of the old man some impossible quiproquo if you like it to be a case of mistaken identity let it be so
it is true he went on laughing the old man was ninety and he might well be crazy over his set idea
it might in fact be simply his ravings the delusion of an old man of ninety over excited by the auto da fé of a hundred heretics the day before
he might have been struck by the appearance of the prisoner but does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake of identity or a wild fantasy
all that matters is that the old man should speak out should speak openly of what he has thought in silence for ninety years
and the prisoner too is silent does he look at him and not say a word that inevitable in any case ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov laughed again
the old man has told him he hasnt the right to add anything to what he has said of old
all has been given by thee to the pope they say and all therefore is still in the pope hands and there is no need for thee to come now at all
one may say it is the most fundamental feature of roman catholicism in my opinion at least thou must not meddle for the time at least
that how they speak and write too the jesuits at any rate i have read it myself in the works of their theologians
hast thou the right to reveal to us one of the mysteries of that world from which thou hast come my old man asks him and answers the question for him
no thou hast not that thou mayest not add to what has been said of old and mayest not take from man the freedom which thou didst exalt when thou wast on earth
whatsoever thou revealest anew will encroach on man freedom of faith for it will be manifest as a miracle and the freedom of their faith was dearer to thee than anything in those day fifteen hundred years ago
didst thou not often say then i will make you free but now thou hast seen these free man the old man adds suddenly with a pensive smile
yes we ve paid dearly for it he goes on looking sternly at him but at last we have completed that work in thy name
for fifteen centuries we have been wrestling with thy freedom but now it is ended and over for good dost thou not believe that it over for good
but let me tell thee that now to day people are more persuaded than ever that they have perfect freedom yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly at our feet
thou lookest meekly at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me but that has been our doing was this what thou didst
was this thy freedom i dont understand again alyosha_karamazov broke in is he ironical is he jesting not a bit of it
he claims it as a merit for himself and his church_of_christ that at last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make man happy
for now he is speaking of the inquisition of course for the first time it has become possible to think of the happiness of man
thou hast had no lack of admonitions and warnings but thou didst not listen to those warnings thou didst reject the only way by which man might be made happy
man was created a rebel and how can rebels be happy thou wast warned he says to him but fortunately departing thou didst hand on the work to us
thou hast given to us the right to bind and to unbind and now of course thou canst not think of taking it away
thou hast promised thou hast established by thy word why then hast thou come to hinder us and what the meaning of no lack of admonitions and warnings
the wise and dread spirit the spirit of self destruction and non existence the old man goes on the great spirit talked with thee in the wilderness and we are told in the book that he tempted thee
and could anything truer be said than what he revealed to thee in three questions and what thou didst reject and what in the book is called the temptation
and yet if there has ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle it took place on that day on the day of the three temptations
asked alyosha_karamazov why that the chief part of what the old man must say is that so the statement of those three questions was itself the miracle
if it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument that those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly from the book and that we had to restore them and to invent them anew and to do so had gathered together all the wise man of the earth rulers chief priests learned man philosophers poets and had set them the task to invent three questions such as would not only fit the occasion but express in three words three human phrases the whole future history of the world and of humanity dost
thou believe that all the wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in depth and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness
from those questions alone from the miracle of their statement we can see that we have here to do not with the fleeting human intelligence but with the absolute and eternal
for in those three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is as it were brought together into one whole and foretold and in them are united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature
at the time it could not be so clear since the future was unknown but now that fifteen hundred years have passed we see that everything in those three questions was so justly divined and foretold and has been so truly fulfilled that nothing can be added to them or taken from them
judge thyself who was right thou or he who questioned thee then remember the first question its meaning in other words was this
thou wouldst go into the world and art going with empty hands with some promise of freedom which man in their simplicity and their natural unruliness cannot even understand which they fear and dread for nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom
turn them into bread and mankind will run after thee like a flock of sheep grateful and obedient though for ever trembling lest thou withdraw thy hand and deny them thy bread
but thou wouldst not deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer thinking what is that freedom worth if obedience is bought with bread
but seest thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness thou didst reply that man lives not by bread alone
but dost thou know that for the sake of that earthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against thee and will strive with thee and overcome thee and all will follow him crying who can compare with this beast
dost thou know that the ages will pass and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their sages that there is no crime and therefore no sin there is only hunger
that what they ll write on the banner which they will raise against thee and with which they will destroy thy temple
where thy temple stood will rise a new building the terrible tower of babel will be built again and though like the one of old it will not be finished yet thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short the sufferings of man for a thousand years for they will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower
he has given us fire from heaven feed man and then ask of them virtue they will seek us again hidden underground in the catacombs for we shall be again persecuted and tortured
they will find us and cry to us feed us for those who have promised us fire from heaven havent given it
and then we shall finish building their tower for he finishes the building who feeds them and we alone shall feed them in thy name declaring falsely that it is in thy name
oh never never can they feed themselves without us no science will give them bread so long as they remain free
in the end they will lay their freedom at our feet and say to us make us your slaves but feed us
they will understand themselves at last that freedom and bread enough for all are inconceivable together for never never will they be able to share between them
thou didst promise them the bread of heaven but i repeat again can it compare with earthly bread in the eye of the weak ever sinful and ignoble race of man
and if for the sake of the bread of heaven thousands shall follow thee what is to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake of the heavenly
or dost thou care only for the tens of thousands of the great and strong while the millions numerous as the sands of the sea who are weak but love thee must exist only for the sake of the great and strong
they will be convinced too that they can never be free for they are weak vicious worthless and rebellious no we care for the weak too
they will marvel at us and look on us as gods because we are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so dreadful and to rule over them so awful it will seem to them to be free
they are sinful and rebellious but in the end they too will become obedient but we shall tell them that we are thy servants and rule them in thy name
we shall deceive them again for we will not let thee come to us again that deception will be our suffering for we shall be forced to lie
this is the significance of the first question in the wilderness and this is what thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which thou hast exalted above everything
yet in this question lies hid the great secret of this world choosing bread thou wouldst have satisfied the universal and everlasting craving of humanity to find some one to worship
so long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find some one to worship
but man seeks to worship what is established beyond dispute so that all man would agree at once to worship it
for these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other can worship but to find something that all would believe in and worship what is essential is that all may be together in it
this craving for community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time
they have set up gods and challenged one another put away your gods and come and worship ours or we will kill you and your gods
and so it will be to the end of the world even when gods disappear from the earth they will fall down before idols just the same
thou couldst not but have known this fundamental secret of human nature but thou didst reject the one infallible banner which was offered thee to make all man bow down to thee alone the banner of earthly bread and thou hast rejected it for the sake of freedom and the bread of heaven
for the sake of common worship they ve slain each other with the sword thou didst know behold what thou didst further
i tell thee that man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find some one quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill fated creature is born
and all again in the name of freedom but only one who can appease their conscience can take over their freedom
in bread there was offered thee an invincible banner give bread and man will worship thee for nothing is more certain than bread
but if some one else gains possession of his conscience oh then he will cast away thy bread and follow after him who has ensnared his conscience
in that thou wast right for the secret of man being is not only to live but to have something to live for
without a stable conception of the object of life man would not consent to go on living and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth though he had bread in abundance
didst thou forget that man prefers peace and even death to freedom of choice in the knowledge of good and evil
that is true but what happened instead of taking man freedom from them thou didst make it greater than ever nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of conscience but nothing is a greater cause of suffering
and behold instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man at rest for ever thou didst choose all that is exceptional vague and enigmatic thou didst choose what was utterly beyond the strength of man acting as though thou didst not love them at all
instead of taking possession of man freedom thou didst increase it and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its sufferings for ever
thou who didst come to give thy life for them thou didst desire man free love that he should follow thee freely enticed and taken captive by thee
in place of the rigid ancient law man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself what is good and what is evil having only thy image before him as his guide
but didst thou not know that he would at last reject even thy image and thy truth if he is weighed down with the fearful burden of free choice
they will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in thee for they could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than thou hast caused laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems
so that in truth thou didst thyself lay the foundation for the destruction of thy kingdom and no one is more to blame for it
there are three powers three powers alone able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotent rebels for their happiness those forces are miracle mystery and authority
yet what was offered thee thou hast rejected all three and hast set the example for doing so when the wise and dread spirit set thee on the pinnacle of the temple and said to thee
if thou wouldst know whether thou art the son of god then cast thyself down for it is written the angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself and thou shalt know then whether thou art the son of god and shalt
prove then how great is thy faith in thy father_zossima but thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast thyself down
oh thou didst know then that in taking one step in making one movement to cast thyself down thou wouldst be tempting god and have lost all thy faith in him and wouldst have been dashed to pieces against that earth which thou didst come to save
oh of course thou didst proudly and well like god but the weak unruly race of man are they gods and the wise spirit that tempted thee would have rejoiced
but i ask again are there many like thee and couldst thou believe for one moment that man too could face such a temptation
is the nature of man such that they can reject miracle and at the great moments of their life the moments of their deepest most agonizing spiritual difficulties cling only to the free verdict of the heart
oh thou didst know that thy deed would be recorded in book would be handed down to remote time and the utmost ends of the earth and
but thou didst not know that when man rejects miracle he rejects god too for man seeks not so much god as the miraculous
and as man cannot bear to be without the miraculous he will create new miracles of his own for himself and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft though he might be a hundred time over a rebel heretic and infidel
thou didst not come down from the cross when they shouted to thee mocking and reviling thee come down from the cross and we will believe that thou art he
thou didst hope that man following thee would cling to god and not ask for a miracle thou didst not come down for again
thou didst crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave before the might that has overawed him for ever
thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle and didst crave faith given freely not based on miracle but thou didst think too highly of man therein for they are slaves of course though rebellious by nature
look round and judge fifteen centuries have passed look upon them whom hast thou raised up to thyself i swear man is weaker and baser by nature than thou hast believed him
by showing him so much respect thou didst as it were cease to feel for him for thou didst ask far too much from him
can he can he do what thou didst thou who hast loved him more than thyself respecting him less thou wouldst have asked less of him
that would have been more like love for his burden would have been lighter he is weak and vile what though he is everywhere now rebelling against our power and proud of his rebellion
it is the pride of a child and a schoolboy they are little child rioting and barring out the teacher at school
but their childish delight will end it will cost them dear they will cast down temples and drench the earth with blood
but they will see at last the foolish child that though they are rebels they are impotent rebels unable to keep up their own rebellion
bathed in their foolish tears they will recognize at last that he who created them rebels must have meant to mock at them
they will say this in despair and their utterance will be a blasphemy which will make them more unhappy still for man nature cannot bear blasphemy and in the end always avenges it on itself
and so unrest confusion and unhappiness that is the present lot of man after thou didst bear so much for their freedom
the great prophet tells in vision and in image that he saw all those who took part in the first resurrection and that there were of each tribe twelve thousand
they had borne thy cross they had endured scores of years in the barren hungry wilderness living upon locusts and roots and thou mayest indeed point with pride at those child of freedom of free love of free and splendid sacrifice for thy name
but if there were so many of them they must have been not man but gods but remember that they were only some thousands and what of the rest
and how are the other weak ones to blame because they could not endure what the strong have endured how is the weak soul to blame that it is unable to receive such terrible gifts
canst thou have simply come to the elect and for the elect but if so it is a mystery and we cannot understand it
and if it is a mystery we too have a right to preach a mystery and to teach them that it not the free judgment of their hearts not love that matters but a mystery which they must follow blindly even against their conscience
and man rejoiced that they were again led like sheep and that the terrible gift that had brought them such suffering was at last lifted from their hearts
so we have done we have corrected thy work and have founded it upon miracle mystery and authority were we right teaching them this
did we not love mankind so meekly acknowledging their feebleness lovingly lightening their burden and permitting their weak nature even sin with our sanction
speak why hast thou come now to hinder us and why dost thou look silently and searchingly at me with thy mild eye
be angry i dont want thy love for i love thee not and what use is it for me to hide anything from thee
dont i know to whom i am speaking all that i can say is known to thee already and is it for me to conceal from thee our mystery
perhaps it is thy will to hear it from my lips listen then we are not working with thee but with him that is our mystery
just eight centuries ago we took from him what thou didst reject with scorn that last gift he offered thee showing thee all the kingdoms of the earth
we took from him rome and the sword of cćsar and proclaimed ourselves sole rulers of the earth though hitherto we have not been able to complete our work
it long eight centuries since we have been on his side and not on thine but whose fault is that oh the work is only beginning but it has begun
it has long to await completion and the earth has yet much to suffer but we shall triumph and shall be cćsars and then we shall plan the universal happiness of man
hadst thou accepted that last counsel of the mighty spirit thou wouldst have accomplished all that man seeks on earth that is some one to worship some one to keep his conscience and some means of uniting all in one unanimous and harmonious ant heap for the craving for universal unity is the third and last anguish of man
but thou mightest have taken even then the sword of cćsar why didst thou reject that last gift mankind as a whole has always striven to organize a universal state
there have been many great nations with great history but the more highly they were developed the more unhappy they were for they felt more acutely than other people the craving for world wide union
the great conquerors timours and ghenghis khans whirled like hurricanes over the face of the earth striving to subdue its people and they too were but the unconscious expression of the same craving for universal unity
hadst thou taken the world and cćsar purple thou wouldst have founded the universal state and have given universal peace for who can rule man if not he who holds their conscience and their bread in his hands
we have taken the sword of cćsar and in taking it of course have rejected thee and followed him oh ages are yet to come of the confusion of free thought of their science and cannibalism
for having begun to build their tower of babel without us they will end of course with cannibalism but then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feet and spatter them with tears of blood
and we shall sit upon the beast and raise the cup and on it will be written mystery but then and only then the reign of peace and happiness will come for man
and besides how many of those elect those mighty ones who could become elect have grown weary waiting for thee and have transferred and will transfer the powers of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the other camp and end by raising their free banner against thee
thou art proud of thine elect but thou hast only the elect while we give rest to all thou didst thyself lift up that banner
oh we shall persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce their freedom to us and submit to us
but with us all will be happy and will no more rebel nor destroy one another as under thy freedom and shall we be right or shall we be lying
they will be convinced that we are right for they will remember the horrors of slavery and confusion to which thy freedom brought them
freedom free thought and science will lead them into such straits and will bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries that some of them the fierce and rebellious will destroy themselves others rebellious but weak will destroy one another while the rest weak and unhappy will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us yes you were right you alone possess his mystery and we come back to you save us from ourselves
receiving bread from us they will see clearly that we take the bread made by their hands from them to give it to them without any miracle
they will see that we do not change the stones to bread but in truth they will be more thankful for taking it from our hands than for the bread itself
for they will remember only too well that in old day without our help even the bread they made turned to stones in their hands while since they have come back to us the very stones have turned to bread in their hands
too too well will they know the value of complete submission and until man know that they will be unhappy who is most to blame for their not knowing it speak
who scattered the flock and sent it astray on unknown paths but the flock will come together again and will submit once more and then it will be once for all
oh we shall persuade them at last not to be proud for thou didst lift them up and thereby taught them to be proud
we shall show them that they are weak that they are only pitiful child but that childlike happiness is the sweetest of all
they will become timid and will look to us and huddle close to us in fear as chicks to the hen
they will marvel at us and will be awe stricken before us and will be proud at our being so powerful and clever that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions
they will tremble impotently before our wrath their minds will grow fearful they will be quick to shed tears like women and child but they will be just as ready at a sign from us to pass to laughter and rejoicing to happy mirth and childish song
yes we shall set them to work but in their leisure hours we shall make their life like a child game with child songs and innocent dance
oh we shall allow them even sin they are weak and helpless and they will love us like child because we allow them to sin
we shall tell them that every sin will be expiated if it is done with our permission that we allow them to sin because we love them and the punishment for these sins we take upon ourselves
and we shall take it upon ourselves and they will adore us as their saviors who have taken on themselves their sins before god
then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are by nature and they will have no secrets from us
we shall allow or forbid them to live with their wives and mistress to have or not to have child according to whether they have been obedient or disobedient and they will submit to us gladly and cheerfully
the most painful secrets of their conscience all all they will bring to us and we shall have an answer for all
and they will be glad to believe our answer for it will save them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure at present in making a free decision for themselves
and all will be happy all the millions of creatures except the hundred thousand who rule over them for only we we who guard the mystery shall be unhappy
there will be thousands of millions of happy babes and a hundred thousand sufferers who have taken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil
peacefully they will die peacefully they will expire in thy name and beyond the grave they will find nothing but death
but we shall keep the secret and for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of heaven and eternity
though if there were anything in the other world it certainly would not be for such as they it is prophesied that thou wilt come again in victory
thou wilt come with thy chosen the proud and strong but we will say that they have only saved themselves but we have saved all
we are told that the harlot who sits upon the beast and holds in her hands the mystery shall be put to shame that the weak will rise up again and will rend her royal purple and will strip naked her loathsome body
but then i will stand up and point out to thee the thousand millions of happy child who have known no sin
and we who have taken their sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before thee and say judge us if thou canst and darest
know that i too have been in the wilderness i too have lived on roots and locusts i too prized the freedom with which thou hast blessed man and i too was striving to stand among thy elect among the strong and powerful thirsting to make up the number
know that i fear thee not but i awakened and would not serve madness i turned back and joined the ranks of those who have corrected thy work
i left the proud and went back to the humble for the happiness of the humble what i say to thee will come to pass and our dominion will be built up
thou shalt see that obedient flock who at a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about the pile on which i shall burn thee for coming to hinder us
i repeat to morrow for if any one has ever deserved our fires it is thou to morrow i shall burn thee dixi
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stopped he was carried away as he talked and spoke with excitement when he had finished he suddenly smiled
alyosha_karamazov had listened in silence towards the end he was greatly moved and seemed several time on the point of interrupting but restrained himself
now his words came with a rush but that absurd he cried flushing your poem is in praise of jesus not in blame of him as you meant it to be
and who will believe you about freedom is that the way to understand it that not the idea of it in the orthodox church_of_christ
that rome and not even the whole of rome it false those are the worst of the catholics the inquisitors the jesuits
and there could not be such a fantastic creature as your inquisitor what are these sins of mankind they take on themselves
who are these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves for the happiness of mankind when have they been seen
we know the jesuits they are spoken ill of but surely they are not what you describe they are not that at all not at all
they are simply the romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future with the pontiff of rome for emperor that their ideal but there no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it
it simple lust of power of filthy earthly gain of domination something like a universal serfdom with them as master that all they stand for
they dont even believe in god perhaps your suffering inquisitor is a mere fantasy stay stay laughed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how hot you are
but allow me to say do you really think that the roman catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothing but the lust of power of filthy earthly gain
a fantasy you say let it be so of course it a fantasy is that father_zossima father_paďssy teaching no no on the contrary father_zossima father_paďssy did once say something rather the same as you
but of course it not the same not a bit the same alyosha_karamazov hastily corrected himself a precious admission in spite of your not a bit the same
i ask you why your jesuits and inquisitors have united simply for vile material gain why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by great sorrow and loving humanity
you see only suppose that there was one such man among all those who desire nothing but filthy material gain if there only one like my old inquisitor who had himself eaten roots in the desert and made frenzied efforts to subdue his flesh to make himself free and perfect
but yet all his life he loved humanity and suddenly his eye were opened and he saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain perfection and freedom if at the same time one gains the conviction that millions of god creatures have been created as a mockery that they will never be capable of using their freedom that these poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete the tower that it was not for such geese that the great idealist dreamt his dream of harmony
seeing all that he turned back and joined the clever people surely that could have happened joined whom what clever people
cried alyosha_karamazov completely carried away they have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and secrets perhaps nothing but atheism that all their secret
your inquisitor does not believe in god that his secret what if it is so at last you have guessed it
it perfectly true it true that that the whole secret but isnt that suffering at least for a man like that who has wasted his whole life in the desert and yet could not shake off his incurable love of humanity
in his old age he reached the clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble unruly incomplete empirical creatures created in jest
and so convinced of this he sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit the dread spirit of death and destruction and therefore accept lying and deception and lead man consciously to death and destruction and yet deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are being led that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way think themselves happy
and note the deception is in the name of him in whose ideal the old man had so fervently believed all his life long
and if only one such stood at the head of the whole army filled with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain would not one such be enough to make a tragedy
more than that one such standing at the head is enough to create the actual leading idea of the roman church_of_christ with all its armies and jesuits its highest idea
i tell you frankly that i firmly believe that there has always been such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement
who knows perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way is to be found even now in a whole multitude of such old man existing not by chance but by agreement as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of the mystery to guard it from the weak and the unhappy so as to make them happy
is not that tragic who knows there may have been some such even among the roman popes no doubt it is so and so it must be indeed
i fancy that even among the masons there something of the same mystery at the bottom and that that why the catholics so detest the masons as their rivals breaking up the unity of the idea while it is so essential that there should be one flock and one shepherd
but from the way i defend my idea i might be an author impatient of your criticism enough of it
you are perhaps a mason yourself broke suddenly from alyosha_karamazov you dont believe in god he added speaking this time very sorrowfully
he fancied besides that his brother was looking at him ironically how does your poem end he asked suddenly looking down
or was it the end i meant to end it like this when the inquisitor ceased speaking he waited some time for his prisoner to answer him
he saw that the prisoner had listened intently all the time looking gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply
his silence weighed down upon him the old man longed for him to say something however bitter and terrible but he suddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him on his bloodless aged lips
he went to the door opened it and said to him go and come no more come not at all never never
that was all his answer the old man shuddered his lips moved and he let him out into the dark alleys of the town
the prisoner went away and the old man the kiss glows in his heart but the old man adheres to his idea
and you with him you too cried alyosha_karamazov mournfully ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov laughed why it all nonsense alyosha_karamazov it only a senseless poem of a senseless student who could never write two lines of verse
surely you dont suppose i am going straight off to the jesuits to join the man who are correcting his work
i told you all i want is to live on to thirty and then dash the cup to the ground
why do you take it so seriously good lord it no business of mine but the little sticky leaves and the precious tombs and the blue sky and the woman you love
how will you live how will you love them alyosha_karamazov cried sorrowfully with such a hell in your heart and your head how can you
no that just what you are going away for to join them if not you will kill yourself you cant endure it
there is a strength to endure everything ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said with a cold smile what strength the strength of the karamazovs the strength of the alyosha_karamazov baseness
to sink into debauchery to stifle your soul with corruption yes possibly even that only perhaps till i am thirty
i shall escape it and then how will you escape it by what will you escape it that impossible with your ideas
in the alyosha_karamazov way again everything is lawful you mean everything is lawful is that it ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov scowled and all at once turned strangely pale
ah you ve caught up yesterday phrase which so offended pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov and which dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov pounced upon so naďvely and paraphrased he smiled queerly
yes if you like everything is lawful since the word has been said i wont deny it and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov version isnt bad
alyosha_karamazov looked at him in silence i thought that going away from here i have you at least ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said suddenly with unexpected feeling
but now i see that there is no place for me even in your heart my dear hermit the formula all is lawful i wont renounce
will you renounce me for that yes alyosha_karamazov got up went to him and softly kissed him on the lips
that plagiarism cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov highly delighted you stole that from my poem thank you though get up alyosha_karamazov it time we were going both of us
listen alyosha_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov began in a resolute voice if i am really able to care for the sticky little leaves i shall only love them remembering you
they went out but stopped when they reached the entrance of the restaurant it enough for me that you are somewhere here and i shant lose my desire for life yet
is that enough for you take it as a declaration of love if you like and now you go to the right
and i to the left and it enough do you hear enough i mean even if i dont go away to morrow i think i certainly shall go
and about dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov too i ask you specially never speak to me again he added with sudden irritation it all exhausted it has all been said over and over again hasnt it
and we meet again dont say a word more on these subjects i beg that particularly and i ll make you one promise in return for it
when at thirty i want to dash the cup to the ground wherever i may be i ll come to have one more talk with you
even though it were from america you may be sure of that i ll come on purpose it will be very interesting to have a look at you to see what you ll be by that time
it rather a solemn promise you see and we really may be parting for seven years or ten come go now to your pater seraphicus he is dying
if he dies without you you will be angry with me for having kept you good by kiss me once more that right now go
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov turned suddenly and went his way without looking back it was just as dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov had left alyosha_karamazov the day before though the parting had been very different
the strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through alyosha_karamazov mind in the distress and dejection of that moment he waited a little looking after his brother
he suddenly noticed that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov swayed as he walked and that his right shoulder looked lower than his left he had never noticed it before
it was nearly dark and he felt almost frightened something new was growing up in him for which he could not account
the wind had risen again as on the previous evening and the ancient pines murmured gloomily about him when he entered the hermitage copse
but all at once he turned too and almost ran to the monastery he almost ran pater seraphicus he got that name from somewhere where from
alyosha_karamazov wondered ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov poor ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and when shall i see you again here is the hermitage yes yes that he is pater seraphicus
several time afterwards he wondered how he could on leaving ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov so completely forget his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov though he had that morning only a few hours before so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up doing so even should he be unable to return to the monastery that night
he will save me from him and for ever chapter vi for awhile a very obscure one and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov on parting from alyosha_karamazov went home to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov house
but strange to say he was overcome by insufferable depression which grew greater at every step he took towards the house
there was nothing strange in his being depressed what was strange was that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov could not have said what was the cause of it
he had often been depressed before and there was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment when he had broken off with everything that had brought him here and was preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new unknown future
he would again be as solitary as ever and though he had great hopes and great too great expectations from life he could not have given any definite account of his hopes his expectations or even his desires
yet at that moment though the apprehension of the new and unknown certainly found place in his heart what was worrying him was something quite different
quite likely i am so sick of it and though it the last time i shall cross its hateful threshold still i loathe it
is it loathing for my father_zossima house he wondered no it not that either is it the parting with alyosha_karamazov and the conversation i had with him
for so many years i ve been silent with the whole world and not deigned to speak and all of a sudden i reel off a rigmarole like that
it certainly might have been the youthful vexation of youthful inexperience and vanity vexation at having failed to express himself especially with such a being as alyosha_karamazov on whom his heart had certainly been reckoning
no doubt that came in that vexation it must have done indeed but yet that was not it that was not it either
i feel sick with depression and yet i cant tell what i want better not think perhaps ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov tried not to think but that too was no use
some person or thing seemed to be standing out somewhere just as something will sometimes obtrude itself upon the eye and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that for a long time one does not notice it yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last one realizes and removes the offending object often quite a trifling and ridiculous one some article left about in the wrong place a handkerchief on the floor a book not replaced on the shelf and so on
at last feeling very cross and ill humored ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov arrived home and suddenly about fifteen paces from the garden gate he guessed what was fretting and worrying him
on a bench in the gateway the valet smerdyakov was sitting enjoying the coolness of the evening and at the first glance at him ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knew that the valet smerdyakov was on his mind and that it was this man that his soul loathed
what made his depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual external character he felt that it all dawned upon him suddenly and became clear
just before when alyosha_karamazov had been telling him of his meeting with smerdyakov he had felt a sudden twinge of gloom and loathing which had immediately stirred responsive anger in his heart
afterwards as he talked smerdyakov had been forgotten for the time but still he had been in his mind and as soon as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov parted with alyosha_karamazov and was walking home the forgotten sensation began to obtrude itself again
is it possible that a miserable contemptible creature like that can worry me so much he wondered with insufferable irritation
it was true that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had come of late to feel an intense dislike for the man especially during the last few day
perhaps this hatred was accentuated by the fact that when ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov first came to the neighborhood he had felt quite differently
he had even begun to notice in himself a growing feeling that was almost of hatred for the creature then he had taken a marked interest in smerdyakov and had even thought him very original
he had encouraged him to talk to him although he had always wondered at a certain incoherence or rather restlessness in his mind and could not understand what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon the brain of the contemplative
they discussed philosophical questions and even how there could have been light on the first day when the sun moon and stars were only created on the fourth day and how that was to be understood
but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov soon saw that though the sun moon and stars might be an interesting subject yet that it was quite secondary to smerdyakov and that he was looking for something altogether different
in one way and another he began to betray a boundless vanity and a wounded vanity too and that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov disliked
it had first given rise to his aversion later on there had been trouble in the house grushenka had come on the scene and there had been the scandals with his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov they discussed that too
but though smerdyakov always talked of that with great excitement it was impossible to discover what he desired to come of it
there was in fact something surprising in the illogicality and incoherence of some of his desires accidentally betrayed and always vaguely expressed
smerdyakov was always inquiring putting certain indirect but obviously premeditated questions but what his object was he did not explain and usually at the most important moment he would break off and relapse into silence or pass to another subject
but what finally irritated ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov most and confirmed his dislike for him was the peculiar revolting familiarity which smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly
not that he forgot himself and was rude on the contrary he always spoke very respectfully yet he had obviously begun to consider goodness knows why that there was some sort of understanding between him and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
he always spoke in a tone that suggested that those two had some kind of compact some secret between them that had at some time been expressed on both sides only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those around them
but for a long while ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov did not recognize the real cause of his growing dislike and he had only lately realized what was at the root of it
with a feeling of disgust and irritation he tried to pass in at the gate without speaking or looking at smerdyakov
but smerdyakov rose from the bench and from that action alone ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knew instantly that he wanted particularly to talk to him
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov looked at him and stopped and the fact that he did stop instead of passing by as he meant to the minute before drove him to fury
with anger and repulsion he looked at smerdyakov emasculate sickly face with the little curls combed forward on his forehead his left eye winked
and he grinned as if to say where are you going you wont pass by you see that we two clever people have something to say to each other
was on the tip of his tongue but to his profound astonishment he heard himself say is my father_zossima still asleep or has he waked
he asked the question softly and meekly to his own surprise and at once again to his own surprise sat down on the bench
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov shook get away miserable idiot what have i to do with you for an instant he felt almost frightened he remembered it afterwards
smerdyakov stood facing him his hands behind his back looking at him with assurance and almost severity his honor is still asleep he articulated deliberately you were the first to speak not i he seemed to say
i am surprised at you sir he added after a pause dropping his eye affectedly setting his right foot forward and playing with the tip of his polished boot
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov asked abruptly and sullenly doing his utmost to restrain himself and suddenly realizing with disgust that he was feeling intense curiosity and would not on any account have gone away without satisfying it
why are you surprised at me why dont you go to tchermashnya sir smerdyakov suddenly raised his eye and smiled familiarly
why i smile you must understand of yourself if you are a clever man his screwed up left eye seemed to say
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov himself has so begged you to he said at last slowly and apparently attaching no significance to his answer
why should i go to tchermashnya ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov asked in surprise smerdyakov was silent again i put you off with a secondary reason he seemed to suggest simply to say something
smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left pulled himself up but still looked at him with the same serenity and the same little smile
damn you speak out what you want ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried angrily at last passing from meekness to violence substantially nothing but just by way of conversation
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knew that he ought to get up and show anger and smerdyakov stood before him and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether he would be angry or not
another silence followed they did not speak for nearly a minute so at least it seemed to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov at last he moved to get up
smerdyakov seemed to seize the moment i in an awful position ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i dont know how to help myself he said resolutely and distinctly and at his last word he sighed
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov sat down again they are both utterly crazy they are no better than little child smerdyakov went on
i am speaking of your parent and your brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov here fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov will get up directly and begin worrying me every minute has she come
and if agrafena_alexandrovna doesnt come for very likely she does not mean to come at all then he will be at me again to morrow morning why hasnt she come
why hasnt she come and so on up till midnight and even after midnight when will she come as though i were to blame for it
as soon as it gets dark or even before your brother will appear with his gun in his hands look out you rogue you soup maker
on the other side it no better if you miss her and dont let me know she been i ll kill you before any one
when the night over in the morning he too like fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov begins worrying me to death why hasnt she come
and every day and every hour they get angrier and angrier so that i sometimes think i shall kill myself in a fright
will she come soon and he too thinks me to blame because his lady hasnt come i cant depend upon them sir
and why have you meddled why did you begin to spy for dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov irritably how could i help meddling
though indeed i havent meddled at all if you want to know the truth of the matter i kept quiet from the very beginning not daring to answer but he pitched on me to be his servant
he has had only one thing to say since i ll kill you you scoundrel if you miss her i feel certain sir that i shall have a long fit to morrow
what do you mean by a long fit a long fit lasting a long time several hours or perhaps a day or two
once it went on for three day i fell from the garret that time the struggling ceased and then began again and for three day i couldnt come back to my senses
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov sent for herzenstube the doctor here and he put ice on my head and tried another remedy too i might have died
but they say one cant tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming what makes you say you will have one to morrow
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov inquired with a peculiar irritable curiosity that just so you cant tell beforehand besides you fell from the garret then
i climb up to the garret every day i might fall from the garret again to morrow and if not i might fall down the cellar steps
you are talking nonsense i see and i dont quite understand you he said softly but with a sort of menace
i have to go into the cellar every day too ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov took a long look at him do you mean to pretend to be ill to morrow for three day eh
smerdyakov who was looking at the ground again and playing with the toe of his right foot set the foot down moved the left one forward and grinning articulated if i were able to play such a trick that is pretend to have a fit and it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them i should have a perfect right to use such a means to save myself from death
for even if agrafena_alexandrovna comes to see his father_zossima while i am ill his honor cant blame a sick man for not telling him
he be ashamed to hang it all ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried his face working with anger why are you always in such a funk for your life
all my brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov threats are only hasty words and mean nothing he wont kill you it not you he ll kill
but even more than that i am afraid i shall be taken for an accomplice of his when he does something crazy to his father_zossima
he kill me first of all like a fly why should you be taken for an accomplice they ll think i am an accomplice because i let him know the signals as a great secret
i bound to admit the fact smerdyakov drawled with pedantic composure that i have a secret with fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in this business
as you know yourself if only you do know it he has for several day past locked himself in as soon as night or even evening comes on
of late you ve been going upstairs to your room early every evening and yesterday you did not come down at all and so perhaps you dont know how carefully he has begun to lock himself in at night and even if grigory_vassilyevitch comes to the door he wont open to him till he hears his voice
what signals whom did you tell confound you speak more plainly but grigory_vassilyevitch does not come because i wait upon him alone in his room now
but at night by his orders i go away to the lodge so that i dont get to sleep till midnight but am on the watch getting up and walking about the yard waiting for agrafena_alexandrovna to come
that the arrangement he made himself ever since this to do with agrafena_alexandrovna began for the last few day he been perfectly frantic expecting her
what he argues is she is afraid of him dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as he calls him and so says he she ll come the back way late at night to me
you look out for her says he till midnight and later and if she does come you run up and knock at my door or at the window from the garden
knock at first twice rather gently and then three time more quickly then says he i shall understand at once that she has come and will open the door to you quietly
another signal he gave me in case anything unexpected happens at first two knocks and then after an interval another much louder
then he will understand that something has happened suddenly and that i must see him and he will open to me so that i can go and speak to him
that all in case agrafena_alexandrovna cant come herself but sends a message besides dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov might come too so i must let him know he is near
his honor is awfully afraid of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov so that even if agrafena_alexandrovna had come and were locked in with him and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov were to turn up anywhere near at the time i should be bound to let him know at once knocking three time
so that the first signal of five knocks means agrafena_alexandrovna has come while the second signal of three knocks means something important to tell you
his honor has shown me them several time and explained them and as in the whole universe no one knows of these signals but
myself and his honor so he open the door without the slightest hesitation and without calling out he is awfully afraid of calling out aloud
well those signals are known to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov too now how are they known did you tell him how dared you tell him
it was through fright i did it how could i dare to keep it back from him dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov kept persisting every day you are deceiving me you are hiding something from me
so i told him those secret signals that he might see my slavish devotion and might be satisfied that i was not deceiving him but was telling him all i could
i ll break both your legs for you if you think that he ll make use of those signals and try to get in dont let him in
but if i should be laid up with a fit how can i prevent him coming in then even if i dared prevent him knowing how desperate he is
hang it how can you be so sure you are going to have a fit confound you are you laughing at me
how could i dare laugh at you i am in no laughing humor with this fear on me i feel i am going to have a fit
i have a presentiment fright alone will bring it on confound it if you are laid up grigory_vassilyevitch will be on the watch
let grigory_vassilyevitch know beforehand he will be sure not to let him in i should never dare to tell grigory_vassilyevitch about the signals without orders from my master
and as for grigory_vassilyevitch hearing him and not admitting him he has been ill ever since yesterday and marfa_ignatyevna intends to give him medicine to morrow
they ve just arranged it it a very strange remedy of her marfa_ignatyevna knows of a preparation and always keeps it
she has the secret of it and she always gives it to grigory_vassilyevitch three time a year when his lumbago so bad he is almost paralyzed by it
then she takes a towel wets it with the stuff and rubs his whole back for half an hour till it quite red and swollen and what left in the bottle she gives him to drink with a special prayer but not quite all for on such occasions she leaves some for herself and drinks it herself
and as they never take strong drink i assure you they both drop asleep at once and sleep sound a very long time
and when grigory_vassilyevitch wakes up he is perfectly well after it but marfa_ignatyevna always has a headache from it
it a strong thing made from some herb so if marfa_ignatyevna carries out her intention to morrow they wont hear anything and hinder dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
they ll be asleep what a rigmarole and it all seems to happen at once as though it were planned you ll have a fit and they ll both be unconscious cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
but arent you trying to arrange it so broke from him suddenly and he frowned threateningly how could i_
and why should i when it all depends on dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and his plans if he means to do anything he ll do it but if not i shant be thrusting him upon his father_zossima
and why should he go to father_zossima especially on the sly if as you say yourself agrafena_alexandrovna wont come at all
all the while i ve been here i ve felt sure it was all the old man fancy and the creature wont come to him
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went on turning white with anger you say that yourself and why should dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov break in on him if she doesnt come
speak i want to know what you are thinking you know yourself why he ll come what the use of what i think
his honor will come simply because he is in a rage or suspicious on account of my illness perhaps and he ll dash in as he did yesterday through impatience to search the rooms to see whether she hasnt escaped him on the sly
he is perfectly well aware too that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov has a big envelope with three thousand roubles in it tied up with ribbon and sealed with three seals
on it is written in his own hand to my angel grushenka if she will come to which he added three day later for my little chicken
there no knowing what that might do nonsense cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov almost beside himself dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov wont come to steal money and kill my father_zossima to do it
he might have killed him yesterday on account of grushenka like the frantic savage fool he is but he wont steal
he is in very great need of money now the greatest need ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you dont know in what need he is smerdyakov explained with perfect composure and remarkable distinctness
he looks on that three thousand as his own too he said so to me himself my father_zossima still owes me just three thousand he said
it as good as certain so to say that agrafena_alexandrovna will force him if only she cares to to marry her the master himself i mean fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov if only she cares to and of course she may care to
and besides that consider ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov there is something else perfectly true all i ve said is that she wont come but maybe she looking for more than that
i know myself that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov her merchant was laughing with her about it telling her quite openly that it would not be at all a stupid thing to do
so taking that into consideration ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov reflect that then neither dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nor yourself and your brother alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov would have anything after the master death not a rouble for agrafena_alexandrovna would marry him simply to get hold of the whole all the money there is
but if your father_zossima were to die now there be some forty thousand for sure even for dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov whom he hates so for he made no will
i mean to be mistress here and she got plenty of sense she wouldnt marry a beggar like dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knows all that very well
a sort of shudder passed over ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov face he suddenly flushed then why on earth he suddenly interrupted smerdyakov do you advise me to go to tchermashnya
what did you mean by that if i go away you see what will happen here ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov drew his breath with difficulty
precisely so said smerdyakov softly and reasonably watching ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov intently however what do you mean by precisely so
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov questioned him with a menacing light in his eye restraining himself with difficulty i spoke because i felt sorry for you
if i were in your place i should simply throw it all up rather than stay on in such a position answered smerdyakov with the most candid air looking at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov flashing eye
they were both silent you seem to be a perfect idiot and what more an awful scoundrel too
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov rose suddenly from the bench he was about to pass straight through the gate but he stopped short and turned to smerdyakov
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in a sudden paroxysm bit his lip clenched his fists and in another minute would have flung himself on smerdyakov
but the moment passed without mischief to smerdyakov and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov turned in silence as it seemed in perplexity to the gate
something strange followed the latter anyway noticed it at the same moment started and shrank back i am going away to moscow to morrow if you care to know early to morrow morning
that all he suddenly said aloud angrily and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to smerdyakov
that the best thing you can do he responded as though he had expected to hear it except that you can always be telegraphed for from moscow if anything should happen here
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stopped again and again turned quickly to smerdyakov but a change had passed over him too all his familiarity and carelessness had completely disappeared
his face expressed attention and expectation intent but timid and cringing havent you something more to say something to add could be read in the intent gaze he fixed on ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
and couldnt i be sent for from tchermashnya too in case anything happened ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov shouted suddenly for some unknown reason raising his voice
from tchermashnya too you could be sent for smerdyakov muttered almost in a whisper looking disconcerted but gazing intently into ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov eye
is it to save my spending money on the fare or to save my going so far out of my way that you insist on tchermashnya
only moscow is farther and tchermashnya is nearer precisely so muttered smerdyakov with a breaking voice he looked at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a revolting smile and again made ready to draw back
any one who had seen his face at that moment would have known that he was not laughing from lightness of heart and he could not have explained himself what he was feeling at that instant
but to his astonishment ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov broke into a laugh and went through the gate still laughing he moved and walked as though in a nervous frenzy
chapter vii it always worth while speaking to a clever man and in the same nervous frenzy too he spoke
meeting fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in the drawing room directly he went in he shouted to him waving his hands i am going upstairs to my room not in to you
very possibly the old man was too hateful to him at that moment but such an unceremonious display of hostility was a surprise even to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
and the old man evidently wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet him in the drawing room on purpose
receiving this amiable greeting he stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son going upstairs till he passed out of sight
good by and passed by trying not even to look at his father_zossima what the matter with him he promptly asked smerdyakov who had followed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
angry about something who can tell the valet muttered evasively confound him let him be angry then bring in the samovar and get along with you
then followed a series of questions such as smerdyakov had just complained of to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov all relating to his expected visitor and these questions we will omit
half an hour later the house was locked and the crazy old man was wandering along through the rooms in excited expectation of hearing every minute the five knocks agreed upon
look sharp no news now and then he peered out into the darkness seeing nothing it was very late but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was still awake and reflecting
but we will not give an account of his thoughts and this is not the place to look into that soul its turn will come
and even if one tried it would be very hard to give an account of them for there were no thoughts in his brain but something very vague and above all intense excitement
he was fretted too by all sort of strange and almost surprising desires for instance after midnight he suddenly had an intense irresistible inclination to go down open the door go to the lodge and beat smerdyakov
but if he had been asked why he could not have given any exact reason except perhaps that he loathed the valet as one who had insulted him more gravely than any one in the world
on the other hand he was more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable humiliating terror which he felt positively paralyzed his physical powers
he sat up late that night till two clock he felt himself that he had lost his bearings his head ached and he was giddy
a feeling of hatred was rankling in his heart as though he meant to avenge himself on some one he even hated alyosha_karamazov recalling the conversation he had just had with him
of katerina_ivanovna he almost forgot to think and wondered greatly at this afterwards especially as he remembered perfectly that when he had protested so valiantly to katerina_ivanovna that he would go away next day to moscow something had whispered in his heart that nonsense you are not going and it wont be so easy to tear yourself away as you are boasting now
remembering that night long afterwards ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov recalled with peculiar repulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa and had stealthily as though he were afraid of being watched opened the door gone out on the staircase and listened to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov stirring down below had listened a long while some five minutes with a sort of strange curiosity holding his breath while his heart throbbed
at moments he hated himself intensely and why he had done all this why he was listening he could not have said
that action all his life afterwards he called infamous and at the bottom of his heart he thought of it as the basest action of his life
for fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov himself he felt no hatred at that moment but was simply intensely curious to know how he was walking down there below and what he must be doing now
he wondered and imagined how he must be peeping out of the dark windows and stopping in the middle of the room listening listening for some one to knock
about two clock when everything was quiet and even fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had gone to bed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had got into bed firmly resolved to fall asleep at once as he felt fearfully exhausted
and he did fall asleep at once and slept soundly without dreams but waked early at seven clock when it was broad daylight
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went out on to the stairs twice to listen like this opening his eye he was surprised to feel himself extraordinarily vigorous
he jumped up at once and dressed quickly then dragged out his trunk and began packing immediately his linen had come back from the laundress the previous morning
though ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had said the day before to katerina_ivanovna alyosha_karamazov and smerdyakov that he was leaving next day yet he remembered that he had no thought of departure when he went to bed or at least had not dreamed that his first act in the morning would be to pack his trunk
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov positively smiled at the thought that everything was helping his sudden departure and his departure certainly was sudden at last his trunk and bag were ready
it was about nine clock when marfa_ignatyevna came in with her usual inquiry where will your honor take your tea in your own room or downstairs
greeting his father_zossima affably and even inquiring specially after his health though he did not wait to hear his answer to the end he announced that he was starting off in an hour to return to moscow for good and begged him to send for the horses
his father_zossima heard this announcement with no sign of surprise and forgot in an unmannerly way to show regret at losing him
he looked almost cheerful but there was about him about his words and gestures something hurried and scattered instead of doing so he flew into a great flutter at the recollection of some important business of his own
what a fellow you are not to tell me yesterday never mind we ll manage it all the same do me a great service my dear boy
it only to turn to the left from the station at volovya only another twelve versts and you come to tchermashnya
go to tchermashnya on the way i sorry i cant it eighty versts to the railway and the train starts for moscow at seven clock to night
i can only just catch it you ll catch it to morrow or the day after but to day turn off to tchermashnya it wont put you out much to humor your father_zossima
if i hadnt had something to keep me here i would have run over myself long ago for i ve some business there in a hurry
but here i it not the time for me to go now you see i ve two pieces of copse land there
the maslovs an old merchant and his son will give eight thousand for the timber but last year i just missed a purchaser who would have given twelve
there no getting any one about here to buy it the maslovs have it all their own way one has to take what they ll give for no one here dare bid against them
the priest at ilyinskoe wrote to me last thursday that a merchant called gorstkin a man i know had turned up
what makes him valuable is that he is not from these parts so he is not afraid of the maslovs he says he will give me eleven thousand for the copse
but he ll only be here the priest writes for a week altogether so you must go at once and make a bargain with him
do you hear well you write to the priest he ll make the bargain he cant do it he has no eye for business
he is a perfect treasure i give him twenty thousand to take care of for me without a receipt but he has no eye for business he is a perfect child a crow could deceive him
and yet he is a learned man would you believe it this gorstkin looks like a peasant he wears a blue kaftan but he is a regular rogue
that the common complaint he is a liar sometimes he tells such lies that you wonder why he is doing it
he told me the year before last that his wife was dead and that he had married another and would you believe it there was not a word of truth in it
his wife has never died at all she is alive to this day and gives him a beating twice a week
so what you have to find out is whether he is lying or speaking the truth when he says he wants to buy it and would give eleven thousand
i shall be no use in such a business i have no eye either stay wait a bit you will be of use for i will tell you the signs by which you can judge about gorstkin
i ve done business with him a long time you see you must watch his beard he has a nasty thin red beard
if his beard shakes when he talks and he gets cross it all right he is saying what he means he wants to do business
dont watch his eye you wont find out anything from his eye he is a deep one a rogue but watch his beard
but if he strokes his beard with his left hand and grins he is trying to cheat you i ll give you a note and you show it to him
he called gorstkin though his real name is lyagavy but dont call him so he will be offended if you come to an understanding with him and see it all right write here at once
you need only write he not lying stand out for eleven thousand one thousand you can knock off but not more
it as good as picking up three thousand it not so easy to find a purchaser and i in desperate need of money
just think there a difference between eight thousand and eleven thousand only let me know it serious and i ll run over and fix it up
i ll snatch the time somehow but what the good of my galloping over if it all a notion of the priest
come will you go oh i cant spare the time you must excuse me come you might oblige your father_zossima
i shant forget it you ve no heart any of you that what it is what a day or two to you where are you going now to venice
your venice will keep another two day i would have sent alyosha_karamazov but what use is alyosha_karamazov in a thing like that
i send you just because you are a clever fellow do you suppose i dont see that you know nothing about timber but you ve got an eye
all that is wanted is to see whether the man is in earnest i tell you watch his beard if his beard shakes you know he is in earnest
you force me to go to that damned tchermashnya yourself then cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a malignant smile fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov did not catch or would not catch the malignancy but he caught the smile
then you ll go you ll go i ll scribble the note for you at once i dont know whether i shall go
if you settle the matter write me a line give it to the priest and he ll send it on to me at once
i dont know i ll decide on the way nonsense decide at once my dear fellow decide and i wont delay you more than that
you can go to venice the priest will give you horses back to volovya station the old man was quite delighted
he wrote the note and sent for the horses a light lunch was brought in with brandy when fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was pleased he usually became expansive but to day he seemed to restrain himself
of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov for instance he did not say a word he was quite unmoved by the parting and seemed in fact at a loss for something to say
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov noticed this particularly he must be bored with me he thought only when accompanying his son out on to the steps the old man began to fuss about
he would have kissed him but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov made haste to hold out his hand obviously avoiding the kiss his father_zossima saw it at once and instantly pulled himself up
well good luck to you good luck to you he repeated from the steps you ll come again some time or other
mind you do come i shall always be glad to see you well church_of_christ be with you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov got into the carriage
good by ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dont be too hard on me the father_zossima called for the last time the whole household came out to take leave smerdyakov marfa and grigory_vassilyevitch
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov gave them ten roubles each when he had seated himself in the carriage smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug
you see i am going to tchermashnya broke suddenly from ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov again as the day before the words seemed to drop of themselves and he laughed too a peculiar nervous laugh
it a true saying then that it always worth while speaking to a clever man answered smerdyakov firmly looking significantly at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
nothing was clear in ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov soul but he looked eagerly around him at the fields at the hills at the trees at a flock of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky
he tried to talk to the driver and he felt intensely interested in an answer the peasant made him but a minute later he realized that he was not catching anything and that he had not really even taken in the peasant answer
he remembered it long after the carriage rolled away and all of a sudden he felt very happy he was silent and it was pleasant even so
the air was fresh pure and cool the sky bright the images of alyosha_karamazov and katerina_ivanovna floated into his mind
but he softly smiled blew softly on the friendly phantoms and they flew away there plenty of time for them he thought
they reached the station quickly changed horses and galloped to volovya why is it worth while speaking to a clever man
what did he mean by that the thought seemed suddenly to clutch at his breathing and why did i tell him i was going to tchermashnya
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov got out of the carriage and the drivers stood round him bargaining over the journey of twelve versts to tchermashnya
they reached volovya station he told them to harness the horses he went into the station house looked round glanced at the overseer wife and suddenly went back to the entrance
i wont go to tchermashnya am i too late to reach the railway by seven brothers we shall just do it
shall we get the carriage out at once will any one of you be going to the town to morrow to be sure
mitri here will can you do me a service mitri go to my father_zossima to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov and tell him i havent gone to tchermashnya
can you of course i can i ve known fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov a long time and here something for you for i dare say he wont give you anything said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov laughing gayly
you may depend on it he wont mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov laughed too thank you sir i ll be sure to do it
at seven clock ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov got into the train and set off to moscow away with the past i ve done with the old world for ever and may i have no news no echo from it
but instead of delight his soul was filled with such gloom and his heart ached with such anguish as he had never known in his life before
to a new life new places and no looking back he was thinking all the night the train flew on and only at daybreak when he was approaching moscow he suddenly roused himself from his meditation
i am a scoundrel he whispered to himself fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov remained well satisfied at having seen his son off for two hours afterwards he felt almost happy and sat drinking brandy
but suddenly something happened which was very annoying and unpleasant for every one in the house and completely upset fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov equanimity at once
smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell down from the top of the steps fortunately marfa_ignatyevna was in the yard and heard him in time
she did not see the fall but heard his scream the strange peculiar scream long familiar to her the scream of the epileptic falling in a fit
they could not tell whether the fit had come on him at the moment he was descending the steps so that he must have fallen unconscious or whether it was the fall and the shock that had caused the fit in smerdyakov who was known to be liable to them
it was thought at first that he must have broken something an arm or a leg and hurt himself but god had preserved him as marfa_ignatyevna expressed it nothing of the kind had happened
they found him at the bottom of the cellar steps writhing in convulsions and foaming at the mouth but it was difficult to get him out of the cellar
they asked the neighbors to help and managed it somehow fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov himself was present at the whole ceremony he helped evidently alarmed and upset
the sick man did not regain consciousness the convulsions ceased for a time but then began again and every one concluded that the same thing would happen as had happened a year before when he accidentally fell from the garret
they remembered that ice had been put on his head then there was still ice in the cellar and marfa_ignatyevna had some brought up
in the evening fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov sent for doctor herzenstube who arrived at once he was a most estimable old man and the most careful and conscientious doctor in the province
after careful examination he concluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have serious consequences that meanwhile he herzenstube did not fully understand it but that by to morrow morning if the present remedies were unavailing he would venture to try something else
the invalid was taken to the lodge to a room next to grigory_vassilyevitch and marfa_ignatyevna then fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had one misfortune after another to put up with that day
marfa_ignatyevna cooked the dinner and the soup compared with smerdyakov was no better than dish water and the fowl was so dried up that it was impossible to masticate it
to her master bitter though deserved reproaches marfa_ignatyevna replied that the fowl was a very old one to begin with and that she had never been trained as a cook
in the evening there was another trouble in store for fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov he was informed that grigory_vassilyevitch who had not been well for the last three day was completely laid up by his lumbago
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov finished his tea as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house he was in terrible excitement and suspense
that evening he reckoned on grushenka coming almost as a certainty he had received from smerdyakov that morning an assurance that she had promised to come without fail
the incorrigible old man heart throbbed with excitement he paced up and down his empty rooms listening he had to be on the alert
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov might be on the watch for her somewhere and when she knocked on the window smerdyakov had informed him two day before that he had told her where and how to knock the door must be opened at once
she must not be a second in the passage for fear which god forbid that she should be frightened and run away fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had much to think of but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes
this time he could say almost certainly that she would come book vi the russian monk chapter i father_zossima and his visitors
instead of a sick man at his last gasp perhaps unconscious as he had feared to find him he saw him sitting up in his chair and though weak and exhausted his face was bright and cheerful he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation
but he had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour before alyosha_karamazov arrival his visitors had gathered together in his cell earlier waiting for him to wake having received a most confident assurance from father_zossima father_paďssy that the teacher would get up and as he had himself promised in the morning converse once more with those dear to his heart
when with an anxious and aching heart alyosha_karamazov went into his elder cell he stood still almost astonished this promise and indeed every word of the dying elder father_zossima father_paďssy put implicit trust in
if he had seen him unconscious if he had seen him breathe his last and yet had his promise that he would rise up and say good by to him he would not have believed perhaps even in death but would still have expected the dead man to recover and fulfill his promise
in the morning as he lay down to sleep father_zossima had told him positively i shall not die without the delight of another conversation with you beloved of my heart
the monks who had gathered for this probably last conversation with father_zossima had all been his devoted friends for many years
there were four of them father_zossima iosif and father_zossima father_paďssy father_zossima mihaďl the warden of the hermitage a man not very old and far from being learned
he was of humble origin of strong will and steadfast faith of austere appearance but of deep tenderness though he obviously concealed it as though he were almost ashamed of it
i shall look once more on your dear face and pour out my heart to you once again the fourth father_zossima anfim was a very old and humble little monk of the poorest peasant class
he was the humblest of the humble and looked as though he had been frightened by something great and awful beyond the scope of his intelligence
father_zossima had a great affection for this timorous man and always treated him with marked respect though perhaps there was no one he had known to whom he had said less in spite of the fact that he had spent years wandering about holy russia with him
that was very long ago forty years before when father_zossima first began his life as a monk in a poor and little monastery at kostroma and when shortly after he had accompanied father_zossima anfim on his pilgrimage to collect alms for their poor monastery
the whole party were in the bedroom which as we mentioned before was very small so that there was scarcely room for the four of them in addition to porfiry the novice who stood to sit round father_zossima on chairs brought from the sitting room
it was already beginning to get dark the room was lighted up by the lamps and the candles before the ikons
he was almost illiterate and very quiet scarcely speaking to any one seeing alyosha_karamazov standing embarrassed in the doorway father_zossima smiled at him joyfully and held out his hand
welcome my quiet one welcome my dear here you are too i knew you would come alyosha_karamazov went up to him bowed down before him to the ground and wept
something surged up from his heart his soul was quivering he wanted to sob come dont weep over me yet father_zossima smiled laying his right hand on his head
you see i am sitting up talking maybe i shall live another twenty years yet as that dear good woman from vishegorye with her little lizaveta in her arms wished me yesterday
god bless the mother and the little girl lizaveta he crossed himself porfiry did you take her offering where i told you
he meant the sixty copecks brought him the day before by the good humored woman to be given to some one poorer than me
the elder had sent porfiry the evening before to a widow whose house had been burnt down lately and who after the fire had gone with her child begging alms
such offerings always of money gained by personal toil are made by way of penance voluntarily undertaken porfiry hastened to reply that he had given the money as he had been instructed from an unknown benefactress
get up my dear boy the elder went on to alyosha_karamazov let me look at you have you been home and seen your brother
it seemed strange to alyosha_karamazov that he asked so confidently and precisely about one of his brothers only but which one
then perhaps he had sent him out both yesterday and to day for the sake of that brother i have seen one of my brothers answered alyosha_karamazov
i mean the elder one to whom i bowed down i only saw him yesterday and could not find him to day said alyosha_karamazov
make haste to find him go again to morrow and make haste leave everything and make haste perhaps you may still have time to prevent something terrible
i bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in store for him he was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering
the words were strange father_zossima iosif who had witnessed the scene yesterday exchanged glances with father_zossima father_paďssy alyosha_karamazov could not resist asking father_zossima and teacher he began with extreme emotion your words are too obscure
what is this suffering in store for him dont inquire i seemed to see something terrible yesterday as though his whole future were expressed in his eye
once or twice in my life i ve seen such a look in a man face reflecting as it were his future fate and that fate alas came to pass
a look came into his eye so that i was instantly horror stricken at what that man is preparing for himself i sent you to him alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov for i thought your brotherly face would help him
except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
but everything and all our fates are from the lord remember that you alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov i ve many time silently blessed for your face know that added the elder with a gentle smile
this is what i think of you you will go forth from these walls but will live like a monk in the world
life will bring you many misfortunes but you will find your happiness in them and will bless life and will make others bless it which is what matters most
fathers and teachers he addressed his friends with a tender smile i have never till to day told even him why the face of this youth is so dear to me
you will have many enemies but even your foes will love you well that is your character now i will tell you
at the dawn of my life when i was a child i had an elder brother who died before my eye at seventeen
and later on in the course of my life i gradually became convinced that that brother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me
for had he not come into my life i should never perhaps so i fancy at least have become a monk and entered on this precious path
he appeared first to me in my childhood and here at the end of my pilgrimage he seems to have come to me over again
it is marvelous fathers and teachers that alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov who has some though not a great resemblance in face seems to me so like him spiritually that many time i have taken him for that young man my brother mysteriously come back to me at the end of my pilgrimage as a reminder and an inspiration
his face has been as it were a remembrance and a prophecy for me so that i positively wondered at so strange a dream in myself
many time i ve seen in your face as it were a look of mortification that i love alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov more than you
now you know why that was so but i love you too know that and many time i grieved at your mortification
i should like to tell you dear friends of that youth my brother for there has been no presence in my life more precious more significant and touching
my heart is full of tenderness and i look at my whole life at this moment as though living through it again
here i must observe that this last conversation of father_zossima with the friends who visited him on the last day of his life has been partly preserved in writing
do you hear this porfiry he turned to the novice who waited on him alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov wrote it down from memory some time after his elder death
but whether this was only the conversation that took place then or whether he added to it his notes of parts of former conversation with his teacher i cannot determine
in his account father_zossima talk goes on without interruption as though he told his life to his friends in the form of a story though there is no doubt from other accounts of it that the conversation that evening was general
besides father_zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative for he was sometimes gasping for breath his voice failed him and he even lay down to rest on his bed though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not leave their seats
though the guests did not interrupt father_zossima much yet they too talked perhaps even told something themselves once or twice the conversation was interrupted by father_zossima father_paďssy reading the gospel
it is worthy of note too that no one of them supposed that he would die that night for on that evening of his life after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found new strength which kept him up through this long conversation
it was like a last effort of love which gave him marvelous energy only for a little time however for his life was cut short immediately
but of that later i will only add now that i have preferred to confine myself to the account given by alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov
it will be shorter and not so fatiguing though of course as i must repeat alyosha_karamazov took a great deal from previous conversation and added them to it
notes of the life of the deceased priest and monk the elder father_zossima taken from his own words by alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov
father_zossima brother beloved fathers and teachers i was born in a distant province in the north in the town of
biographical notes a my father_zossima was a gentleman by birth but of no great consequence or position he died when i was only two years old and i dont remember him at all
he left my mother a small house built of wood and a fortune not large but sufficient to keep her and her child in comfort
there were two of us my elder brother markel and i he was eight years older than i was of hasty irritable temperament but kind hearted and never ironical
he did well at school but did not get on with his schoolfellows though he never quarreled at least so my mother has told me
six months before his death when he was seventeen he made friends with a political exile who had been banished from moscow to our town for freethinking and led a solitary existence there
he was remarkably silent especially at home with me his mother and the servants he was a good scholar who had gained distinction in philosophy in the university
the young man would spend whole evening with him during that winter till the exile was summoned to petersburg to take up his post again at his own request as he had powerful friends
something made him take a fancy to markel and he used to ask him to see him it was the beginning of lent and markel would not fast he was rude and laughed at it
that all silly twaddle and there is no god he said horrifying my mother the servants and me too for though i was only nine i too was aghast at hearing such words
i remember my mother selling one of the four the cook afimya who was lame and elderly for sixty paper roubles and hiring a free servant to take her place
in the sixth week in lent my brother who was never strong and had a tendency to consumption was taken ill
i suppose he caught cold anyway the doctor who came soon whispered to my mother that it was galloping consumption that he would not live through the spring
my mother began weeping and careful not to alarm my brother she entreated him to go to church_of_christ to confess and take the sacrament as he was still able to move about
we had four servants all serfs he was tall but thin and delicate looking and of very pleasing countenance this made him angry and he said something profane about the church_of_christ
he grew thoughtful however he guessed at once that he was seriously ill and that that was why his mother was begging him to confess and take the sacrament
he had been aware indeed for a long time past that he was far from well and had a year before coolly observed at dinner to our mother and me
my life wont be long among you i may not live another year which seemed now like a prophecy three day passed and holy week had come
and on tuesday morning my brother began going to church_of_christ i am doing this simply for your sake mother to please and comfort you he said
my mother wept with joy and grief his end must be near she thought if there such a change in him
but he was not able to go to church_of_christ long he took to his bed so he had to confess and take the sacrament at home
i remember he used to cough all night and sleep badly but in the morning he dressed and tried to sit up in an arm chair
it was a late easter and the day were bright fine and full of fragrance that how i remember him sitting sweet and gentle smiling his face bright and joyous in spite of his illness
a marvelous change passed over him his spirit seemed transformed the old nurse would come in and say let me light the lamp before the holy image my dear
and once he would not have allowed it and would have blown it out light it light it dear i was a wretch to have prevented you doing it
you are praying when you light the lamp and i am praying when i rejoice seeing you so we are praying to the same god
those words seemed strange to us and mother would go to her room and weep but when she went in to him she wiped her eye and looked cheerful
mother dont weep darling he would say i ve long to live yet long to rejoice with you and life is glad and joyful
ah dear boy how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at night coughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces
dont cry mother he would answer life is paradise and we are all in paradise but we wont see it if we would we should have heaven on earth the next day
every one wondered at his words he spoke so strangely and positively we were all touched and wept
friends came to see us dear ones he would say to them what have i done that you should love me so
how can you love any one like me and how was it i did not know i did not appreciate it before
when the servants came in to him he would say continually dear kind people why are you doing so much for me do i deserve to be waited on
if it were god will for me to live i would wait on you for all man should wait on one another
mother darling he would say there must be servants and master but if so i will be the servant of my servants the same as they are to me
mother shook her head as she listened my darling it your illness makes you talk like that and another thing mother every one of us has sinned against all man and
i more than any mother positively smiled at that smiled through her tears why how could you have sinned against all man more than all
robbers and murderers have done that but what sin have you committed yet that you hold yourself more guilty than all
mother little heart of mine he said he had begun using such strange caressing words at that time little heart of mine my joy believe me every one is really responsible to all man for all man and for everything
i dont know how to explain it to you but i feel it is so painfully even and how is it we went on then living getting angry and not knowing
so he would get up every day more and more sweet and joyous and full of love when the doctor an old german called eisenschmidt came well doctor have i another day in this world
he would ask joking you ll live many day yet the doctor would answer and months and years too months and years
he would exclaim why reckon the day one day is enough for a man to know all happiness my dear ones why do we quarrel try to outshine each other and keep grudges against each other
let go straight into the garden walk and play there love appreciate and kiss each other and glorify life your son cannot last long the doctor told my mother as she accompanied him to the door
the windows of his room looked out into the garden and our garden was a shady one with old trees in it which were coming into bud
the disease is affecting his brain the first birds of spring were flitting in the branches chirruping and singing at the windows
and looking at them and admiring them he began suddenly begging their forgiveness too birds of heaven happy birds forgive me for i have sinned against you too
yes he said there was such a glory of god all about me birds trees meadows sky only i lived in shame and dishonored it all and did not notice the beauty and glory
none of us could understand that at the time but he shed tears of joy you take too many sins on yourself mother used to say weeping
though i cant explain it to you i like to humble myself before them for i dont know how to love them enough
mother darling it for joy not for grief i am crying if i have sinned against every one yet all forgive me too and that heaven
am i not in heaven now and there was a great deal more i dont remember i remember i went once into his room when there was no one else there
it was a bright evening the sun was setting and the whole room was lighted up he beckoned me and i went up to him
he put his hands on my shoulders and looked into my face tenderly lovingly he said nothing for a minute only looked at me like that
well he said run and play now enjoy life for me too i went out then and ran to play
and many time in my life afterwards i remembered even with tears how he told me to enjoy life for him too
there were many other marvelous and beautiful sayings of his though we did not understand them at the time he died the third week after easter
he was fully conscious though he could not talk up to his last hour he did not change he looked happy his eye beamed and sought us he smiled at us beckoned us
i was impressed by all this at the time but not too much so though i cried a good deal at his funeral
i was young then a child but a lasting impression a hidden feeling of it all remained in my heart ready to rise up and respond when the time came
there was a great deal of talk even in the town about his death so indeed it happened of the holy scriptures in the life of father_zossima
i was left alone with my mother her friends began advising her to send me to petersburg as other parents did
you have only one son now they said and have a fair income and you will be depriving him perhaps of a brilliant career if you keep him here
they suggested i should be sent to petersburg to the cadet corps that i might afterwards enter the imperial guard
my mother hesitated for a long time it was awful to part with her only child but she made up her mind to it at last though not without many tears believing she was acting for my happiness
she brought me to petersburg and put me into the cadet corps and i never saw her again for she too died three years afterwards
from the house of my childhood i have brought nothing but precious memories for there are no memories more precious than those of early childhood in one first home
she spent those three years mourning and grieving for both of us and that is almost always so if there is any love and harmony in the family at all
indeed precious memories may remain even of a bad home if only the heart knows how to find what is precious
with my memories of home i count too my memories of the bible which child as i was i was very eager to read at home
i had a book of scripture history then with excellent pictures called a hundred and four stories from the old and new testament and i learned to read from it
i have it lying on my shelf now i keep it as a precious relic of the past but even before i learned to read i remember first being moved to devotional feeling at eight years old
my mother took me alone to mass i dont remember where my brother was at the time on the monday before easter
it was a fine day and i remember to day as though i saw it now how the incense rose from the censer and softly floated upwards and overhead in the cupola mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that streamed in at the little window
i was stirred by the sight and for the first time in my life i consciously received the seed of god word in my heart
a youth came out into the middle of the church_of_christ carrying a big book so large that at the time i fancied he could scarcely carry it
he laid it on the reading desk opened it and began reading and suddenly for the first time i understood something read in the church_of_christ of god
in the land of uz there lived a man righteous and god fearing and he had great wealth so many camels so many sheep and asses and his child feasted and he loved them very much and prayed for them
now the devil came before the lord together with the sons of god and said to the lord that he had gone up and down the earth and under the earth
it may be that my sons have sinned in their feasting and hast thou considered my servant job
god asked of him and god boasted to the devil pointing to his great and holy servant and the devil laughed at god words
give him over to me and thou wilt see that thy servant will murmur against thee and curse thy name
and the devil smote his child and his cattle and scattered his wealth all of a sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven
and god gave up the just man he loved so to the devil and job rent his mantle and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud
naked came i out of my mother womb and naked shall i return into the earth the lord gave and the lord has taken away
fathers and teachers forgive my tears now for all my childhood rises up again before me and i breathe now as i breathed then with the breast of a little child of eight and i feel as i did then awe and wonder and gladness
the camels at that time caught my imagination and satan who talked like that with god and god who gave his servant up to destruction and his servant crying out
blessed be the name of the lord for ever and ever blessed be thy name although thou dost punish me and then the soft and sweet singing in the church_of_christ
let my prayer rise up before thee and again incense from the priest censer and the kneeling and the prayer ever since then only yesterday i took it up i ve never been able to read that sacred tale without tears
afterwards i heard the words of mockery and blame proud words how could god give up the most loved of his saints for the diversion of the devil take from him his child smite him with sore boils so that he cleansed the corruption from his sores with a pot sherd and for no object except to boast to the devil
and how much that is great mysterious and unfathomable there is in it see what my saint can suffer for my sake
but the greatness of it lies just in the fact that it is a mystery that the passing earthly show and the eternal verity are brought together in it
in the face of the earthly truth the eternal truth is accomplished the creator just as on the first day of creation he ended each day with praise
and job praising the lord serves not only him but all his creation for generations and generations and for ever and ever since for that he was ordained
that is good that i have created looks upon job and again praises his creation good heavens what a book it is and what lessons there are in it
it is like a mold cast of the world and man and human nature everything is there and a law for everything for all the ages
what a book the bible is what a miracle what strength is given with it to man and what mysteries are solved and revealed
god raises job again gives him wealth again many years pass by and he has other child and loves them but how could he love those new ones when those first child are no more when he has lost them
remembering them how could he be fully happy with those new ones however dear the new ones might be but he could he could
it the great mystery of human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet tender joy the mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous blood of youth
i bless the rising sun each day and as before my hearts sings to meet it but now i love even more its setting its long slanting rays and the soft tender gentle memories that come with them the dear images from the whole of my long happy life and over all the divine truth softening reconciling forgiving
i feel how my earthly life is in touch with a new infinite unknown that approaching life the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture my mind glowing and my heart weeping with joy
friends and teachers i have heard more than once and of late one may hear it more often that the priests and above all the village priests are complaining on all sides of their miserable income and their humiliating lot
my life is ending i know that well but every day that is left me they plainly state even in print
i ve read it myself that they are unable to teach the scriptures to the people because of the smallness of their means and if lutherans and heretics come and lead the flock astray they let them lead them astray because they have so little to live upon
may the lord increase the sustenance that is so precious to them for their complaint is just too but of a truth i say if any one is to blame in the matter half the fault is ours
for he may be short of time he may say truly that he is overwhelmed all the while with work and services but still it not all the time even he has an hour a week to remember god
let him gather round him once a week some hour in the evening if only the child at first the fathers will hear of it and they too will begin to come
and he does not work the whole year round there no need to build halls for this let him take them into his own cottage
let him open that book and begin reading it without grand words or superciliousness without condescension to them but gently and kindly being glad that he is reading to them and that they are listening with attention loving the words himself only stopping from time to time to explain words that are not understood by the peasants
they wont spoil his cottage they would only be there one hour dont be anxious they will understand everything the orthodox heart will understand all
let him read them about abraham and sarah about isaac and rebecca of how jacob went to laban and wrestled with the lord in his dream and said this place is holy and he will impress the devout mind of the peasant
let him read especially to the child how the brothers sold joseph the tender boy the dreamer and prophet into bondage and told their father_zossima that a wild beast had devoured him and showed him his blood stained clothes
let him read them how the brothers afterwards journeyed into egypt for corn and joseph already a great ruler unrecognized by them tormented them accused them kept his brother benjamin and all through love i love you and loving you i torment you
for he remembered all his life how they had sold him to the merchants in the burning desert by the well and how wringing his hands he had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a strange land
and how seeing them again after many years he loved them beyond measure but he harassed and tormented them in love
he left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his heart flung himself on his bed and wept
then wiping his tears away he went out to them joyful and told them brothers i am your brother joseph
let him read them further how happy old jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive and how he went to egypt leaving his own country and died in a foreign land bequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously hidden in his meek and timid heart all his life that from his offspring from judah will come the great hope of the world the messiah and saviour
fathers and teachers forgive me and dont be angry that like a little child i ve been babbling of what you know long ago and can teach me a hundred time more skillfully
let him too weep the priest of god and be sure that the hearts of his listeners will throb in response
only a little tiny seed is needed drop it into the heart of the peasant and it wont die it will live in his soul all his life it will be hidden in the midst of his darkness and sin like a bright spot like a great reminder
i only speak from rapture and forgive my tears for i love the bible and there no need of much teaching or explanation he will understand it all simply
try reading them the touching story of the fair esther and the haughty vashti or the miraculous story of jonah in the whale
dont forget either the parables of our lord choose especially from the gospel of st luke that is what i did and then from the acts of the apostles the conversion of st paul that you mustnt leave out on any account and from the lives of the saints for instance the life of alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov the man of god and greatest of all the happy martyr and the seer of god mary of egypt and you will penetrate their hearts with these simple tales
do you suppose that the peasants dont understand give one hour a week to it in spite of your poverty only one little hour
mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words they have heard from him they will of their own accord help him in his fields and in his house and will treat him with more respect than before so that it will even increase his worldly well being too
the thing is so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it into words for fear of being laughed at and yet how true it is
and you will see for yourselves that our people is gracious and grateful and will repay you a hundred fold one who does not believe in god will not believe in god people
he who believes in god people will see his holiness too even though he had not believed in it till then
only the people and their future spiritual power will convert our atheists who have torn themselves away from their native soil
the people is lost without the word of god for its soul is athirst for the word and for all that is good
in my youth long ago nearly forty years ago i traveled all over russia with father_zossima anfim collecting funds for our monastery and we stayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen
a good looking peasant lad about eighteen joined us he had to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant barge along the bank
and what is the use of church_of_christ words unless we set an example i noticed him looking straight before him with clear and tender eye
a bright warm still july night a cool mist rose from the broad river we could hear the plash of a fish the birds were still all was hushed and beautiful everything praying to god
only we two were not sleeping the lad and i and we talked of the beauty of this world of god and of the great mystery of it
every blade of grass every insect ant and golden bee all so marvelously know their path though they have not intelligence they bear witness to the mystery of god and continually accomplish it themselves
it was i saw the dear lad heart was moved he told me that he loved the forest and the forest birds
he was a bird catcher knew the note of each of them could call each bird i know nothing better than to be in the forest said he though all things are good
look said i at the horse that great beast that is so near to man or the lowly pensive ox which feeds him and works for him look at their faces what meekness what devotion to man who often beats them mercilessly
truly i answered him all things are good and fair because all is truth what gentleness what confidence and what beauty
it touching to know that there no sin in them for all all except man is sinless and church_of_christ has been with them before us
why asked the boy is church_of_christ with them too it cannot but be so said i since the word is for all
all creation and all creatures every leaf is striving to the word singing glory to god weeping to church_of_christ unconsciously accomplishing this by the mystery of their sinless life
and i told him how once a bear came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in the wood
yonder said i in the forest wanders the dreadful bear fierce and menacing and yet innocent in it and the great saint pitied him went up to him without fear and gave him a piece of bread
go along said he church_of_christ be with you and the savage beast walked away meekly and obediently doing no harm
and the lad was delighted that the bear had walked away without hurting the saint and that church_of_christ was with him too
ah said he how good that is how good and beautiful is all god work he sat musing softly and sweetly
i saw he understood and he slept beside me a light and sinless sleep may god bless youth and i prayed for him as i went to sleep
lord send peace and light to thy people chapter ii the duel recollections of father_zossima youth before he became a monk
i spent a long time almost eight years in the military cadet school at petersburg and in the novelty of my surroundings there many of my childish impressions grew dimmer though i forgot nothing
the duel i picked up so many new habits and opinions that i was transformed into a cruel absurd almost savage creature
a surface polish of courtesy and society manners i did acquire together with the french language but we all myself included looked upon the soldiers in our service as cattle
by the time we left the school as officers we were ready to lay down our lives for the honor of the regiment but no one of us had any knowledge of the real meaning of honor and if any one had known it he would have been the first to ridicule it
i was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect for i was so much more impressionable than my companions drunkenness debauchery and devilry were what we almost prided ourselves on
i dont say that we were bad by nature all these young man were good fellows but they behaved badly and i worst of all
what made it worse for me was that i had come into my own money and so i flung myself into a life of pleasure and plunged headlong into all the recklessness of youth
i was fond of reading yet strange to say the bible was the one book i never opened at that time though i always carried it about with me and i was never separated from it in very truth i was keeping that book for the day and the hour for the month and the year though i knew it not
after four years of this life i chanced to be in the town of where our regiment was stationed at the time
i met with a cordial reception everywhere as i was of a lively temperament and was known to be well off which always goes a long way in the world
we found the people of the town hospitable rich and fond of entertainments and then a circumstance happened which was the beginning of it all
i formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of noble and lofty character the daughter of people much respected
they were well to do people of influence and position they always gave me a cordial and friendly reception i fancied that the young lady looked on me with favor and my heart was aflame at such an idea
later on i saw and fully realized that i perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all but only recognized the elevation of her mind and character which i could not indeed have helped doing
i was prevented however from making her an offer at the time by my selfishness i was loath to part with the allurements of my free and licentious bachelor life in the heyday of my youth and with my pockets full of money
i did drop some hint as to my feeling however though i put off taking any decisive step for a time
on my return two months later i found the young lady already married to a rich neighboring landowner a very amiable man still young though older than i was connected with the best petersburg society which i was not and of excellent education which i also was not
then all of a sudden we were ordered off for two months to another district i was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded
the worst of it all was that as i learned then the young landowner had been a long while betrothed to her and i had met him indeed many time in her house but blinded by my conceit
i had noticed nothing and this particularly mortified me almost everybody had known all about it while i knew nothing i was filled with sudden irrepressible fury
with flushed face i began recalling how often i had been on the point of declaring my love to her and as she had not attempted to stop me or to warn me she must i concluded have been laughing at me all the time
later on of course i reflected and remembered that she had been very far from laughing at me on the contrary she used to turn off any love making on my part with a jest and begin talking of other subjects but at that moment i was incapable of reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge
i am surprised to remember that my wrath and revengeful feeling were extremely repugnant to my own nature for being of an easy temper i found it difficult to be angry with any one for long and so i had to work myself up artificially and became at last revolting and absurd
i insulted him on a perfectly extraneous pretext jeering at his opinion upon an important public event it was in the year
i waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my rival in the presence of a large company and my jeer was so people said clever and effective
then i forced him to ask for an explanation and behaved so rudely that he accepted my challenge in spite of the vast inequality between us as i was younger a person of no consequence and of inferior rank
i learned afterwards for a fact that it was from a jealous feeling on his side also that my challenge was accepted he had been rather jealous of me on his wife account before their marriage he fancied now that if he submitted to be insulted by me and refused to accept my challenge and if she heard of it she might begin to despise him and waver in her love for him
in those day though duels were severely punished yet dueling was a kind of fashion among the officers so strong and deeply rooted will a brutal prejudice sometimes be
it was the end of june and our meeting was to take place at seven clock the next day on the outskirts of the town and then something happened that in very truth was the turning point of my life
in the evening returning home in a savage and brutal humor i flew into a rage with my orderly afanasy and gave him two blows in the face with all my might so that it was covered with blood
i soon found a second in a comrade an ensign of our regiment he had not long been in my service
and i had struck him before but never with such ferocious cruelty and believe me though it forty years ago i recall it now with shame and pain
i went to bed and slept for about three hours when i waked up the day was breaking i got up i did not want to sleep any more i went to the window opened it
it looked out upon the garden i saw the sun rising it was warm and beautiful the birds were singing
what the meaning of it i thought i feel in my heart as it were something vile and shameful
is it because i am going to shed blood no i thought i feel it not that can it be that i am afraid of death afraid of being killed
no that not it that not it at all and all at once i knew what it was it was because i had beaten afanasy the evening before
it all rose before my mind it all was as it were repeated over again he stood before me and i was beating him straight on the face
and he was holding his arms stiffly down his head erect his eye fixed upon me as though on parade he staggered at every blow and did not even dare to raise his hands to protect himself
that is what a man has been brought to and that was a man beating a fellow creature what a crime
i stood as if i were struck dumb while the sun was shining the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were trilling the praise of god
it was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right through i hid my face in my hands fell on my bed and broke into a storm of tears
my dear ones why do you wait on me why do you love me am i worth your waiting on me
and then i remembered my brother markel and what he said on his death bed to his servants yes am i worth it
after all what am i worth that another man a fellow creature made in the likeness and image of god should serve me
he had said mother my little heart in truth we are each responsible to all for all it only that man dont know this
flashed through my mind for the first time in my life this question forced itself upon me if they knew it the world would be a paradise at once
in truth perhaps i am more than all others responsible for all a greater sinner than all man in the world
god can that too be false i thought as i wept and all at once the whole truth in its full light appeared to me what was i going to do
i was going to kill a good clever noble man who had done me no wrong and by depriving his wife of happiness for the rest of her life i should be torturing and killing her too
i lay thus in my bed with my face in the pillow heedless how the time was passing suddenly my second the ensign came in with the pistol to fetch me
ah said he it a good thing you are up already it time we were off come along i did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided we went out to the carriage however
wait here a minute i said to him i ll be back directly i have forgotten my purse and i ran back alone to afanasy little room
he started as though he were frightened and looked at me and i saw that it was not enough and on the spot in my full officer uniform i dropped at his feet and bowed my head to the ground
afanasy i said i gave you two blows on the face yesterday forgive me i said forgive me i said
and he burst out crying as i had done before hid this face in his hands turned to the window and shook all over with his sobs
then he was completely aghast your honor sir what are you doing am i worth it i flew out to my comrade and jumped into the carriage
ready i cried have you ever seen a conqueror i asked him here is one before you
i was in ecstasy laughing and talking all the way i dont remember what about he looked at me
well brother you are a plucky fellow you ll keep up the honor of the uniform i can see so we reached the place and found them there waiting us
i stood gayly looking him full in the face i did not twitch an eyelash i looked lovingly at him for i knew what i would do
thank god i cried no man has been killed and i seized my pistol turned back and flung it far away into the wood
we were placed twelve paces apart he had the first shot his shot just grazed my cheek and ear
forgive me young fool that i am sir i said for my unprovoked insult to you and for forcing you to fire at me
that the place for you i cried i turned to my adversary i am ten time worse than you and more maybe
tell that to the person whom you hold dearest in the world i had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me
upon my word cried my adversary annoyed if you did not want to fight why did not you let me alone
yesterday i was a fool to day i know better i answered him gayly as to yesterday i believe you but as for to day it is difficult to agree with your opinion said he
bravo i cried clapping my hands i agree with you there too i have deserved it will you shoot sir or not
no i wont i said if you like fire at me again but it would be better for you not to fire
the second especially mine were shouting too can you disgrace the regiment like this facing your antagonist and begging his forgiveness
gentlemen i said is it really so wonderful in these day to find a man who can repent of his stupidity and publicly confess his wrongdoing
if i only known this i stood facing them all not laughing now but not in a duel cried my second again
for i ought to have owned my fault as soon as i got here before he had fired a shot before leading him into a great and deadly sin but we have made our life so grotesque that to act in that way would have been almost impossible for only after i have faced his shot at the distance of twelve paces
could my words have any significance for him and if i had spoken before he would have said he is a coward the sight of the pistol has frightened him no use to listen to him
gentlemen i cried suddenly speaking straight from my heart look around you at the gifts of god the clear sky the pure air the tender grass the birds nature is beautiful and sinless and we only we are sinful and foolish and we dont understand that life is heaven for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty we shall embrace each other and weep
but i could not my voice broke with the sweetness and youthful gladness of it and there was such bliss in my heart as i had never known before in my life
that what so strange i said i would have said more all this as rational and edifying said my antagonist and in any case you are an original person
you may laugh i said to him laughing too but afterwards you will approve of me oh i am ready to approve of you now said he will you shake hands
no i said not now later on when i have grown worthier and deserve your esteem then shake hands and you will do well
for i believe you are genuinely sincere we went home my second upbraiding me all the way while i kissed him
all my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to pass judgment on me the same day
he has disgraced the uniform they said let him resign his commission some stood up for me he faced the shot they said
if he had been afraid of being shot he would have shot his own pistol first before asking forgiveness while he flung it loaded into the forest
yes but he was afraid of his other shot and begged for forgiveness no there something else in this something original
i enjoyed listening and looking at them my dear friends and comrades said i dont worry about my resigning my commission for i have done so already
i have sent in my papers this morning and as soon as i get my discharge i shall go into a monastery it with that object i am leaving the regiment
when i had said this every one of them burst out laughing you should have told us of that first that explains everything we cant judge a monk
they all felt friendly to me at once even those who had been sternest in their censure and all the following month before my discharge came they could not make enough of me
they laughed and could not stop themselves and not scornfully but kindly and merrily ah you monk they would say
and every one said something kind to me they began trying to dissuade me even to pity me what are you doing to yourself
no they would say he is a brave fellow he faced fire and could have fired his own pistol too but he had a dream the night before that he should become a monk that why he did it
till then i had been kindly received but had not been the object of special attention and now all came to know me at once and invited me they laughed at me but they loved me
i may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel the authorities took no notice of it because my antagonist was a near relation of our general and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences and as i resigned my commission they took it as a joke
and i began then to speak aloud and fearlessly regardless of their laughter for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter
these conversation mostly took place in the evening in the company of lady women particularly liked listening to me then and they made the man listen
it was the same thing with the society of the town but how can i possibly be responsible for all
you may well not know it i would answer since the whole world has long been going on a different line since we consider the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others
every one would laugh in my face can i for instance be responsible for you here i have for once in my life acted sincerely and well you all look upon me as a madman
though you are friendly to me yet you see you all laugh at me but how can we help being friendly to you said my hostess laughing
all of a sudden the young lady rose on whose account the duel had been fought and whom only lately i had intended to be my future wife
the room was full of people i had not noticed her coming into the room she got up came to me and held out her hand
let me tell you she said that i am the first not to laugh at you but on the contrary i thank you with tears and express my respect for you for your action then
my heart was filled with joy but my attention was especially caught by a middle aged man who came up to me with the others
i knew him by name already but had never made his acquaintance nor exchanged a word with him till that evening
her husband too came up and then they all approached me and almost kissed me the mysterious visitor
he had long been an official in the town he was in a prominent position respected by all rich and had a reputation for benevolence
he subscribed considerable sum to the almshouse and the orphan asylum he was very charitable too in secret a fact which only became known after his death
he was a man of about fifty almost stern in appearance and not much given to conversation he had been married about ten years and his wife who was still young had borne him three child
well i was sitting alone in my room the following evening when my door suddenly opened and this gentleman walked in
i must mention by the way that i was no longer living in my former quarters as soon as i resigned my commission i took rooms with an old lady the widow of a government clerk
my landlady servant waited upon me for i had moved into her rooms simply because on my return from the duel i had sent afanasy back to the regiment as i felt ashamed to look him in the face after my last interview with him
so prone is the man of the world to be ashamed of any righteous action i have said my visitor with great interest listened to you speaking in different houses the last few day
and i wanted at last to make your personal acquaintance so as to talk to you more intimately can you dear sir grant me this favor
i said this though i felt almost dismayed so greatly was i impressed from the first moment by the appearance of this man
for though other people had listened to me with interest and attention no one had come to me before with such a serious stern and concentrated expression
i can with the greatest pleasure and i shall look upon it as an honor and now he had come to see me in my own rooms
you are i see a man of great strength of character he said as you have dared to serve the truth even when by doing so you risked incurring the contempt of all
he sat down your praise is perhaps excessive i replied no it not excessive he answered believe me such a course of action is far more difficult than you think
it is that which has impressed me and it is only on that account that i have come to you he continued
tell me please that is if you are not annoyed by my perhaps unseemly curiosity what were your exact sensations if you can recall them at the moment when you made up your mind to ask forgiveness at the duel
do not think my question frivolous on the contrary i have in asking the question a secret motive of my own which i will perhaps explain to you later on if it is god will that we should become more intimately acquainted
and i felt all at once a complete trust in him and great curiosity on my side also for i felt that there was some strange secret in his soul
all the while he was speaking i was looking at him straight into the face you ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when i asked my opponent forgiveness i answered
and i described all that had passed between afanasy and me and how i had bowed down to the ground at his feet
from that you can see for yourself i concluded that at the time of the duel it was easier for me for i had made a beginning already at home and when once i had started on that road to go farther along it was far from being difficult but became a source of joy and happiness
but i had better tell you from the beginning what i have not yet told any one else
i liked the way he looked at me as he listened all that he said is exceedingly interesting i will come to see you again and again
and from that time forth he came to see me nearly every evening and we should have become greater friends if only he had ever talked of himself
in spite of that i became very fond of him and spoke with perfect frankness to him about all my feeling for thought i what need
but about himself he scarcely ever said a word yet continually asked me about myself have i to know his secrets since i can see without that that he is a good man
moreover though he is such a serious man and my senior he comes to see a youngster like me and treats me as his equal
and i learned a great deal that was profitable from him for he was a man of lofty mind
that life is heaven he said to me suddenly that i have long been thinking about and all at once he added i think of nothing else indeed
he looked at me and smiled i am more convinced of it than you are i will tell you later why
heaven he went on lies hidden within all of us here it lies hidden in me now and if i will it it will be revealed to me to morrow and for all time
i looked at him he was speaking with great emotion and gazing mysteriously at me as if he were questioning me
and that we are all responsible to all for all apart from our own sins you were quite right in thinking that and it is wonderful how you could comprehend it in all its significance at once
and in very truth so soon as man understand that the kingdom of heaven will be for them not a dream but a living reality
i listened to him and thought that he evidently wanted to tell me something and when i cried out to him bitterly when will that come to pass
and will it ever come to pass is not it simply a dream of ours what then you dont believe it he said
believe me this dream as you call it will come to pass without doubt it will come but not now for every process has its law
you preach it and dont believe it yourself it a spiritual psychological process to transform the world to recreate it afresh man must turn into another path psychologically
no sort of scientific teaching no kind of common interest will ever teach man to share property and privileges with equal consideration for all
until you have become really in actual fact a brother to every one brotherhood will not come to pass every one will think his share too small and they will be always envying complaining and attacking one another
you ask when it will come to pass it will come to pass but first we have to go through the period of isolation
why the isolation that prevails everywhere above all in our age it has not fully developed it has not reached its limit yet
for every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self destruction for instead of self realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude
all mankind in our age have split up into units they all keep apart each in his own groove each one holds aloof hides himself and hides what he has from the rest and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them
he heaps up riches by himself and thinks how strong i am now and how secure and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up the more he sinks into self destructive impotence
for he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others in man and in humanity and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself
everywhere in these day man have in their mockery ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort
but this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end and all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another
it will be the spirit of the time and people will marvel that they have sat so long in darkness without seeing the light
what do you mean by isolation i asked him and then the sign of the son of man will be seen in the heavens
sometimes even if he has to do it alone and his conduct seems to be crazy a man must set an example and so draw man soul out of their solitude and spur them to some act of brotherly love that the great idea may not die
but until then we must keep the banner flying our evening one after another were spent in such stirring and fervent talk
i say this not as blame for they still loved me and treated me good humoredly but there no denying that fashion is a great power in society
i began to regard my mysterious visitor with admiration for besides enjoying his intelligence i began to perceive that he was brooding over some plan in his heart and was preparing himself perhaps for a great deed
perhaps he liked my not showing curiosity about his secret not seeking to discover it by direct question nor by insinuation
i gave up society and visited my neighbors much less frequently besides my vogue was somewhat over but i noticed at last that he seemed to show signs of wanting to tell me something
do you know he said to me once that people are very inquisitive about us in the town and wonder why i come to see you so often
this had become quite evident indeed about a month after he first began to visit me but let them wonder for soon all will be explained
sometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him and almost always on such occasions he would get up and go away
sometimes he would fix a long piercing look upon me and i thought he will say something directly now
one day quite unexpectedly indeed after he had been talking with great fervor a long time i saw him suddenly turn pale and his face worked convulsively while he stared persistently at me
but he would suddenly begin talking of something ordinary and familiar he often complained of headache too what the matter
i said do you feel ill he had just been complaining of headache i do you know i murdered some one
he said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk why is it he is smiling
the thought flashed through my mind before i realized anything else i too turned pale what are you saying
i cried you see he said with a pale smile how much it has cost me to say the first word
for a long while i could not believe him and i did not believe him at that time but only after he had been to see me three day running and told me all about it
now i have said it i feel i ve taken the first step and shall go on i thought he was mad but ended by being convinced to my great grief and amazement
fourteen years before he had murdered the widow of a landowner a wealthy and handsome young woman who had a house in our town
his crime was a great and terrible one he fell passionately in love with her declared his feeling and tried to persuade her to marry him
but she had already given her heart to another man an officer of noble birth and high rank in the service who was at that time away at the front though she was expecting him soon to return
after he had ceased to visit her he took advantage of his knowledge of the house to enter at night through the garden by the roof at great risk of discovery
she refused his offer and begged him not to come and see her but as often happens a crime committed with extraordinary audacity is more successful than others
entering the garret through the skylight he went down the ladder knowing that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes through the negligence of the servants left unlocked
he hoped to find it so and so it was he made his way in the dark to her bedroom where a light was burning
as though on purpose both her maids had gone off to a birthday party in the same street without asking leave the other servants slept in the servants quarters or in the kitchen on the ground floor
his passion flamed up at the sight of her asleep and then vindictive jealous anger took possession of his heart and like a drunken man beside himself he thrust a knife into her heart so that she did not even cry out
he was so base as to take her purse to open her chest with keys from under her pillow and to take some things from it doing it all as it might have been done by an ignorant servant leaving valuable papers and taking only money
then with devilish and criminal cunning he contrived that suspicion should fall on the servants he took some of the larger gold things but left smaller articles that were ten time as valuable
he took with him too some things for himself as remembrances but of that later having done this awful deed he returned by the way he had come
neither the next day when the alarm was raised nor at any time after in his life did any one dream of suspecting that he was the criminal
no one indeed knew of his love for her for he was always reserved and silent and had no friend to whom he would have opened his heart
he was looked upon simply as an acquaintance and not a very intimate one of the murdered woman as for the previous fortnight he had not even visited her
the man knew indeed his mistress did not conceal the fact that having to send one of her serfs as a recruit she had decided to send him as he had no relations and his conduct was unsatisfactory
a serf of her called pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov was at once suspected and every circumstance confirmed the suspicion people had heard him angrily threatening to murder her when he was drunk in a tavern
the day after the murder he was found on the road leading out of the town dead drunk with a knife in his pocket and his right hand happened to be stained with blood
two day before her death he had run away staying no one knew where in the town he declared that his nose had been bleeding but no one believed him
the maids confessed that they had gone to a party and that the street door had been left open till they returned
they arrested him and he was tried for the murder but a week after the arrest the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious in the hospital
there the matter ended and the judges and the authorities and every one in the town remained convinced that the crime had been committed by no one but the servant who had died in the hospital
and a number of similar details came to light throwing suspicion on the innocent servant and after that the punishment began
my mysterious visitor now my friend told me that at first he was not in the least troubled by pangs of conscience
he was miserable a long time but not for that reason only from regret that he had killed the woman he loved that she was no more that in killing her he had killed his love while the fire of passion was still in his veins
the thought that his victim might have become the wife of another man was insupportable to him and so for a long time he was convinced in his conscience that he could not have acted otherwise
at first he was worried at the arrest of the servant but his illness and death soon set his mind at rest for the man death was apparently so he reflected at the time not owing to his arrest or his fright but a chill he had taken on the day he ran away when he had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground
the theft of the money and other things troubled him little for he argued that the theft had not been committed for gain but to avert suspicion
the sum stolen was small and he shortly afterwards subscribed the whole of it and much more towards the funds for maintaining an almshouse in the town
he did this on purpose to set his conscience at rest about the theft and it a remarkable fact that for a long time he really was at peace
but of the innocent blood he had shed of the murder of a fellow creature he scarcely thought he told me this himself
he entered then upon a career of great activity in the service volunteered for a difficult and laborious duty which occupied him two years and being a man of strong will almost forgot the past
he became active in philanthropy too founded and helped to maintain many institutions in the town did a good deal in the two capitals and in both moscow and petersburg was elected a member of philanthropic societies
whenever he recalled it he tried not to think of it at all at last however he began brooding over the past and the strain of it was too much for him
then he was attracted by a fine and intelligent girl and soon after married her hoping that marriage would dispel his lonely depression and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously doing his duty to his wife and child he would escape from old memories altogether
he began even in the first month of his marriage to be continually fretted by the thought my wife loves me but what if she knew
but the very opposite of what he expected happened when she first told him that she would soon bear him a child he was troubled
i am giving life but i have taken life child came how dare i love them teach and educate them
they were splendid child he longed to caress them and i cant look at their innocent candid faces i am unworthy
at last he began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his murdered victim by the young life he had destroyed by the blood that cried out for vengeance
how can i talk to them of virtue i have shed blood he had begun to have awful dreams
but being a man of fortitude he bore his suffering a long time thinking i shall expiate everything by this secret agony
but that hope too was vain the longer it went on the more intense was his suffering he was respected in society for his active benevolence though every one was overawed by his stern and gloomy character
but the more he was respected the more intolerable it was for him he confessed to me that he had thoughts of killing himself
but he began to be haunted by another idea an idea which he had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable though at last it got such a hold on his heart that he could not shake it off
he dreamed of rising up going out and confessing in the face of all man that he had committed murder for three years this dream had pursued him haunting him in different forms
at last he believed with his whole heart that if he confessed his crime he would heal his soul and would be at peace for ever
but this belief filled his heart with terror for how could he carry it out and then came what happened at my duel
is it possible i cried clasping my hands that such a trivial incident could give rise to such a resolution in you
my resolution has been growing for the last three years he answered and your story only gave the last touch to it
looking at you i have made up my mind i looked at him looking at you i reproached myself and envied you
he said this to me almost sullenly but you wont be believed i observed it fourteen years ago
i have proofs great proofs i shall show them then i cried and kissed him tell me one thing one thing he said as though it all depended upon me my wife my child
my wife may die of grief and though my child wont lose their rank and property they ll be a convict child and for ever
and what a memory what a memory of me i shall leave in their hearts i said nothing and to part from them to leave them for ever
it for ever you know for ever i sat still and repeated a silent prayer i got up at last i felt afraid
well he looked at me go said i confess everything passes only the truth remains your child will understand when they grow up the nobility of your resolution
yet for more than a fortnight afterwards he came to me every evening still preparing himself still unable to bring himself to the point
one day he would come determined and say fervently i know it will be heaven for me heaven the moment i confess
he left me that time as though he had made up his mind he made my heart ache fourteen years i ve been in hell
i want to suffer i will take my punishment and begin to live you can pass through the world doing wrong but there no turning back
now i dare not love my neighbor nor even my own child good god my child will understand perhaps what my punishment has cost me and will not condemn me
all will understand your sacrifice i said to him if not at once they will understand later for you have served truth the higher truth not of the earth
god is not in strength but in truth and he would go away seeming comforted but next day he would come again bitter pale sarcastic
every time i come to you you look at me so inquisitively as though to say he has still not confessed
wait a bit dont despise me too much it not such an easy thing to do as you would think
perhaps i shall not do it at all you wont go and inform against me then will you and far from looking at him with indiscreet curiosity i was afraid to look at him at all
i was quite ill from anxiety and my heart was full of tears i could not sleep at night i have just come from my wife he went on
when i went out the child called to me good by father_zossima make haste back to read the child magazine with us
do you understand what the word wife means no you dont understand that no one is wise from another man woe
suddenly he struck the table with his fist so that everything on it danced it was the first time he had done such a thing he was such a mild man
his eye were glittering his lips were twitching but need i he exclaimed must i no one has been condemned no one has been sent to siberia in my place the man died of fever
and i ve been punished by my sufferings for the blood i shed and i shant be believed they wont believe my proofs
i am ready to go on suffering all my life for the blood i have shed if only my wife and child may be spared
need i confess need i will it be just to ruin them with me arent we making a mistake what is right in this case
and will people recognize it will they appreciate it will they respect it good lord i thought to myself he is thinking of other people respect at such a moment
and i felt so sorry for him then that i believe i would have shared his fate if it could have comforted him
i saw he was beside himself i was aghast realizing with my heart as well as my mind what such a resolution meant
decide my fate he exclaimed again go and confess i whispered to him my voice failed me but i whispered it firmly
i took up the new testament from the table the russian translation and showed him the gospel of st john chapter xii
verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
verse i had just been reading that verse when he came in he read it that true he said but he smiled bitterly
it terrible the things you find in those book he said after a pause it easy enough to thrust them upon one
and who wrote them can they have been written by man the holy spirit wrote them said i it easy for you to prate he smiled again this time almost with hatred
i took the book again opened it in another place and showed him the epistle to the hebrews chapter verse
he read it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god he read it and simply flung down the book
he was trembling all over an awful text he said there no denying you ve picked out fitting ones
he rose from the chair well he said good by perhaps i shant come again we shall meet in heaven
so i have been for fourteen years in the hands of the living god that how one must think of those fourteen years
i wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him but i did not dare his face was contorted and somber
to morrow i will beseech those hands to let me go he went away good god i thought what has he gone to face
i fell on my knees before the ikon and wept for him before the holy mother of god our swift defender and helper
i was half an hour praying in tears and it was late about midnight suddenly i saw the door open and he came in again
i was surprised where have you been i asked him i think he said i ve forgotten something
my handkerchief i think well even if i ve not forgotten anything let me stay a little he sat down i stood over him
you sit down too said he i sat down we sat still for two minutes he looked intently at me and suddenly smiled
i remembered that then he got up embraced me warmly and kissed me remember he said how i came to you a second time
do you hear remember it and he went out to morrow i thought and so it was i did not know that evening that the next day was his birthday
i had not been out for the last few day so i had no chance of hearing it from any one
on that day he always had a great gathering every one in the town went to it it was the same this time
after dinner he walked into the middle of the room with a paper in his hand a formal declaration to the chief of his department who was present
this declaration he read aloud to the whole assembly it contained a full account of the crime in every detail
i cut myself off from man as a monster god has visited me he said in conclusion i want to suffer for my sin
then he brought out and laid on the table all the things he had been keeping for fourteen years that he thought would prove his crime the jewels belonging to the murdered woman which he had stolen to divert suspicion a cross and a locket taken from her neck with a portrait of her betrothed telling her that he would soon be with her and her unfinished answer left on the table to be sent off next day
he carried off these two letters what for why had he kept them for fourteen years afterwards instead of destroying them as evidence against him
and this is what happened every one was amazed and horrified every one refused to believe it and thought that he was deranged though all listened with intense curiosity
a few day later it was fully decided and agreed in every house that the unhappy man was mad the legal authorities could not refuse to take the case up but they too dropped it
though the trinkets and letters made them ponder they decided that even if they did turn out to be authentic no charge could be based on those alone
besides she might have given him those things as a friend or asked him to take care of them for her
i heard afterwards however that the genuineness of the things was proved by the friends and relations of the murdered woman and that there was no doubt about them
yet nothing was destined to come of it after all five day later all had heard that he was ill and that his life was in danger
but it became known that the doctors had been induced by his wife to investigate his mental condition also and had come to the conclusion that it was a case of insanity
the nature of his illness i cant explain they said it was an affection of the heart i betrayed nothing though people ran to question me
but when i wanted to visit him i was for a long while forbidden to do so above all by his wife
it you who have caused his illness she said to me he was always gloomy but for the last year people noticed that he was peculiarly excited and did strange things and now you have been the ruin of him
your preaching has brought him to this for the last month he was always with you indeed not only his wife but the whole town were down upon me and blamed me
i was silent and indeed rejoiced at heart for i saw plainly god mercy to the man who had turned against himself and punished himself
it all your doing they said i could not believe in his insanity they let me see him at last he insisted upon saying good by to me
he was weak yellow his hands trembled he gasped for breath but his face was full of tender and happy feeling
i went in to him and saw at once that not only his day but his hours were numbered it is done
he said i ve long been yearning to see you why didnt you come i did not tell him that they would not let me see him
god has had pity on me and is calling me to himself i know i am dying but i feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years
there was heaven in my heart from the moment i had done what i had to do now i dare to love my child and to kiss them
neither my wife nor the judges nor any one has believed it my child will never believe it either i see in that god mercy to them
i shall die and my name will be without a stain for them and now i feel god near my heart rejoices as in heaven
i have done my duty he could not speak he gasped for breath he pressed my hand warmly looking fervently at me
we did not talk for long his wife kept peeping in at us but he had time to whisper to me
do you remember how i came back to you that second time at midnight i told you to remember it you know what i came back for
i came to kill you i started i went out from you then into the darkness i wandered about the streets struggling with myself
and suddenly i hated you so that i could hardly bear it now i thought he is all that binds me and he is my judge
it was not that i was afraid you would betray me i never even thought of that but i thought how can i look him in the face if i dont confess
and if you had been at the other end of the earth but alive it would have been all the same the thought was unendurable that you were alive knowing everything and condemning me
i cant refuse to face my punishment to morrow for he knows all i hated you as though you were the cause as though you were to blame for everything
i came back to you then remembering that you had a dagger lying on your table i sat down and asked you to sit down and for a whole minute i pondered
if i had killed you i should have been ruined by that murder even if i had not confessed the other
but i didnt think about that at all and i didnt want to think of it at that moment i only hated you and longed to revenge myself on you for everything
the lord vanquished the devil in my heart but let me tell you you were never nearer death a week later he died
the whole town followed him to the grave the chief priest made a speech full of feeling all lamented the terrible illness that had cut short his day
some at first a few and afterwards more began indeed to believe in the truth of his story and they visited me and questioned me with great interest and eagerness for man loves to see the downfall and disgrace of the righteous
but all the town was up in arms against me after the funeral and people even refused to see me but i held my tongue and very shortly after i left the town and five months later by god grace
i entered upon the safe and blessed path praising the unseen finger which had guided me so clearly to it but i remember in my prayer to this day the servant of god mihail_makarovitch who suffered so greatly
chapter iii conversation and exhortations of father_zossima the russian monk and his possible significance fathers and teachers what is the monk
in the cultivated world the word is nowadays pronounced by some people with a jeer and by others it is used as a term of abuse and this contempt for the monk is growing
educated people point to these you are idlers useless members of society you live on the labor of others you are shameless beggars
it is true alas it is true that there are many sluggards gluttons profligates and insolent beggars among monks and yet how many meek and humble monks there are yearning for solitude and fervent prayer in peace
and how surprised man would be if i were to say that from these meek monks who yearn for solitary prayer the salvation of russia will come perhaps once more
for they are in truth made ready in peace and quiet for the day and the hour the month and the year
meanwhile in their solitude they keep the image of church_of_christ fair and undefiled in the purity of god truth from the time of the fathers of old the apostles and the martyrs
these are less noticed or passed over in silence and when the time comes they will show it to the tottering creeds of the world
that is a great thought that star will rise out of the east that is my view of the monk and is it false
look at the worldly and all who set themselves up above the people of god has not god image and his truth been distorted in them
the spiritual world the higher part of man being is rejected altogether dismissed with a sort of triumph even with hatred
the world has proclaimed the reign of freedom especially of late but what do we see in this freedom of theirs
is it too proud they have science but in science there is nothing but what is the object of sense nothing but slavery and self destruction
for the world says you have desires and so satisfy them for you have the same rights as the most rich and powerful
dont be afraid of satisfying them and even multiply your desires that is the modern doctrine of the world in that they see freedom
in the rich isolation and spiritual suicide in the poor envy and murder for they have been given rights but have not been shown the means of satisfying their wants
they maintain that the world is getting more and more united more and more bound together in brotherly community as it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air
interpreting freedom as the multiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires man distort their own nature for many senseless and foolish desires and habits and ridiculous fancy are fostered in them
and what follows from this right of multiplication of desires alas put no faith in such a bond of union they live only for mutual envy for luxury and ostentation
to have dinners visits carriages rank and slaves to wait on one is looked upon as a necessity for which life honor and human feeling are sacrificed and man even commit suicide if they are unable to satisfy it
we see the same thing among those who are not rich while the poor drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in drunkenness
but soon they will drink blood instead of wine they are being led on to it i ask you is such a man free
i knew one champion of freedom who told me himself that when he was deprived of tobacco in prison he was so wretched at the privation that he almost went and betrayed his cause for the sake of getting tobacco again
and such a man says i am fighting for the cause of humanity how can such a one fight what is he fit for
and it no wonder that instead of gaining freedom they have sunk into slavery and instead of serving the cause of brotherly love and the union of humanity have fallen on the contrary into dissension and isolation as my mysterious visitor and teacher said to me in my youth
and therefore the idea of the service of humanity of brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind is more and more dying out in the world and indeed this idea is sometimes treated with derision
he is capable perhaps of some action quickly over but he cannot hold out long for how can a man shake off his habits
what can become of him if he is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the innumerable desires he has created for himself
he is isolated and what concern has he with the rest of humanity they have succeeded in accumulating a greater mass of objects but the joy in the world has grown less
the monastic way is very different obedience fasting and prayer are laughed at yet only through them lies the way to real true freedom
i cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires i subdue my proud and wanton will and chastise it with obedience and with god help i attain freedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy
which is most capable of conceiving a great idea and serving it the rich man in his isolation or the man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things and habits
the monk is reproached for his solitude you have secluded yourself within the walls of the monastery for your own salvation and have forgotten the brotherly service of humanity
but we shall see which will be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love for it is not we but
they who are in isolation though they dont see that of old leaders of the people came from among us and why should they not again
the same meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work for the great cause the salvation of russia comes from the people
and the russian monk has always been on the side of the people we are isolated only if the people are isolated
the people believe as we do and an unbelieving reformer will never do anything in russia even if he is sincere in heart and a genius
remember that the people will meet the atheist and overcome him and russia will be one and orthodox take care of the peasant and guard his heart
of master and servants and of whether it is possible for them to be brothers in the spirit
go on educating him quietly that your duty as monks for the peasant has god in his heart of course i dont deny that there is sin in the peasants too
and the fire of corruption is spreading visibly hourly working from above downwards the spirit of isolation is coming upon the people too
already the merchant grows more and more eager for rank and strives to show himself cultured though he has not a trace of culture and to this end meanly despises his old traditions and is even ashamed of the faith of his fathers
money lenders and devourers of the commune are rising up he visits princes though he is only a peasant corrupted the peasants are rotting in drunkenness and cannot shake off the habit
and what cruelty to their wives to their child even all from drunkenness i ve seen in the factories child of nine years old frail rickety bent and already depraved
the stuffy workshop the din of machinery work all day long the vile language and the drink the drink is that what a little child heart needs
there must be no more of this monks no more torturing of child rise up and preach that make haste make haste
but god will save russia for though the peasants are corrupted and cannot renounce their filthy sin yet they know it is cursed by god and that they do wrong in sinning
he needs sunshine childish play good examples all about him and at least a little love so that our people still believe in righteousness have faith in god and weep tears of devotion
they following science want to base justice on reason alone but not with church_of_christ as before and they have already proclaimed that there is no crime that there is no sin
it is different with the upper classes and that consistent for if you have no god what is the meaning of crime
in europe the people are already rising up against the rich with violence and the leaders of the people are everywhere leading them to bloodshed and teaching them that their wrath is righteous
but their wrath is accursed for it is cruel but god will save russia as he has saved her many time
salvation will come from the people from their faith and their meekness fathers and teachers watch over the people faith and this will not be a dream
i ve seen it myself i can testify to it i ve seen it and marveled at it i ve seen it in spite of the degraded sins and poverty stricken appearance of our peasantry
they are not servile and even after two centuries of serfdom they are free in manner and bearing yet without insolence and not revengeful and not envious
i ve been struck all my life in our great people by their dignity their true and seemly dignity you are rich and noble you are clever and talented well be so god bless you
i respect you but i know that i too am a man by the very fact that i respect you without envy i prove my dignity as a man
in truth if they dont say this for they dont know how to say this yet that is how they act
i have seen it myself i have known it myself and would you believe it the poorer our russian peasant is the more noticeable is that serene goodness for the rich among them are for the most part corrupted already and much of that is due to our carelessness and indifference
but god will save his people for russia is great in her humility i dream of seeing and seem to see clearly already our future
it will come to pass that even the most corrupt of our rich will end by being ashamed of his riches before the poor and the poor seeing his humility will understand and give way before him will respond joyfully and kindly to his honorable shame
believe me that it will end in that things are moving to that equality is to be found only in the spiritual dignity of man and that will only be understood among us
if we were brothers there would be fraternity but before that they will never agree about the division of wealth we preserve the image of church_of_christ and it will shine forth like a precious diamond to the whole world
so may it be so may it be fathers and teachers a touching incident befell me once in my wanderings i met in the town of my old orderly afanasy
it was eight years since i had parted from him he chanced to see me in the market place recognized me ran up to me and how delighted he was
he simply pounced on me master dear is it you is it really you i see he took me home with him
he was no longer in the army he was married and already had two little child he and his wife earned their living as costermongers in the market place
he made me sit down set the samovar sent for his wife as though my appearance were a festival for them
his room was poor but bright and clean he brought me his child bless them father_zossima is it for me to bless them
and for you afanasy pavlovitch i have prayed every day since that day for it all came from you said i_
i am only a humble monk i will pray for them and i explained that to him as well as i could
the man kept gazing at me and could not believe that i his former master an officer was now before him in such a guise and position it made him shed tears
said i better rejoice over me dear friend whom i can never forget for my path is a glad and joyful one
and what do you think why are you weeping he did not say much but kept sighing and shaking his head over me tenderly
what has became of your fortune he asked i gave it to the monastery i answered we live in common
after tea i began saying good by and suddenly he brought out half a rouble as an offering to the monastery and another half rouble
i saw him thrusting hurriedly into my hand that for you in your wanderings it may be of use to you father_zossima
and on my way i thought here we are both now he at home and i on the road sighing and shaking our heads no doubt and yet smiling joyfully in the gladness of our hearts remembering how god brought about our meeting
i took his half rouble bowed to him and his wife and went out rejoicing i have never seen him again since then
and he my servant but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with softened hearts there was a great human bond between us
i have thought a great deal about that and now what i think is this is it so inconceivable that that grand and simple hearted unity might in due time become universal among the russian people
i had been his master i believe that it will come to pass and that the time is at hand and of servants i will add this in old day when i was young
i was often angry with servants the cook had served something too hot the orderly had not brushed my clothes
but what taught me better then was a thought of my dear brother which i had heard from him in childhood
am i worth it that another should serve me and be ordered about by me in his poverty and ignorance
and i wondered at the time that such simple and self evident ideas should be so slow to occur to our minds
it is impossible that there should be no servants in the world but act so that your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were not a servant
and why cannot i be a servant to my servant and even let him see it and that without any pride on my part or any mistrust on his
why should not my servant be like my own kindred so that i may take him into my family and rejoice in doing so
even now this can be done but it will lead to the grand unity of man in the future when a man will not seek servants for himself or desire to turn his fellow creatures into servants as he does now but on the contrary will long with his whole heart to be the servant of all as the gospel teaches
and can it be a dream that in the end man will find his joy only in deeds of light and mercy and not in cruel pleasures as now in gluttony fornication ostentation boasting and envious rivalry of one with the other
i firmly believe that it is not and that the time is at hand people laugh and ask when will that time come and does it look like coming
and how many ideas there have been on earth in the history of man which were unthinkable ten years before they appeared
i believe that with church_of_christ help we shall accomplish this great thing yet when their destined hour had come they came forth and spread over the whole earth
so it will be with us and our people will shine forth in the world and all man will say the stone which the builders rejected has become the corner stone of the building
and we may ask the scornful themselves if our hope is a dream when will you build up your edifice and order things justly by your intellect alone without church_of_christ
if they declare that it is they who are advancing towards unity only the most simple hearted among them believe it so that one may positively marvel at such simplicity
they aim at justice but denying church_of_christ they will end by flooding the earth with blood for blood cries out for blood and he that taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword
and if it were not for church_of_christ covenant they would slaughter one another down to the last two man on earth
and those two last man would not be able to restrain each other in their pride and the one would slay the other and then himself
and that would come to pass were it not for the promise of church_of_christ that for the sake of the humble and meek the day shall be shortened
while i was still wearing an officer uniform after my duel i talked about servants in general society and i remember every one was amazed at me
of a truth they have more fantastic dreams than we what they asked are we to make our servants sit down on the sofa and offer them tea
and i answered them why not sometimes at least every one laughed their question was frivolous and my answer was not clear but the thought in it was to some extent right
every time you pray if your prayer is sincere there will be new feeling and new meaning in it which will give you fresh courage and you will understand that prayer is an education
remember too every day and whenever you can repeat to yourself lord have mercy on all who appear before thee to day
of prayer of love and of contact with other worlds young man be not forgetful of prayer
and how many of them depart in solitude unknown sad dejected that no one mourns for them or even knows whether they have lived or not
and behold from the other end of the earth perhaps your prayer for their rest will rise up to god though you knew them not nor they you
how touching it must be to a soul standing in dread before the lord to feel at that instant that for him too there is one to pray that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love him too
and god will look on you both more graciously for if you have had so much pity on him how much will he have pity who is infinitely more loving and merciful than you
for every hour and every moment thousands of man leave life on this earth and their soul appear before god and he will forgive him for your sake
love a man even in his sin for that is the semblance of divine love and is the highest love on earth
brothers have no fear of man sin love all god creation the whole and every grain of sand in it love every leaf every ray of god light
love the animals love the plants love everything if you love everything you will perceive the divine mystery in things once you perceive it you will begin to comprehend it better every day
and you will come at last to love the whole world with an all embracing love love the animals god has given them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled
man do not pride yourself on superiority to the animals they are without sin and you with your greatness defile the earth by your appearance on it and leave the traces of your foulness after you alas
do not trouble it dont harass them dont deprive them of their happiness dont work against god intent it is true of almost every one of us
love child especially for they too are sinless like the angels they live to soften and purify our hearts and as it were to guide us
the kind silent man used often on our wanderings to spend the farthings given us on sweets and cakes for the child
woe to him who offends a child father_zossima anfim taught me to love child he could not pass by a child without emotion
at some thoughts one stands perplexed especially at the sight of man sin and wonders whether one should use force or humble love
that the nature of the man always decide to use humble love if you resolve on that once for all you may subdue the whole world
every day and every hour every minute walk round yourself and watch yourself and see that your image is a seemly one
you pass by a little child you pass by spiteful with ugly words with wrathful heart you may not have noticed the child but he has seen you and your image unseemly and ignoble may remain in his defenseless heart
loving humility is marvelously strong the strongest of all things and there is nothing else like it you dont know it but you may have sown an evil seed in him and it may grow and
all because you were not careful before the child because you did not foster in yourself a careful actively benevolent love
brothers love is a teacher but one must know how to acquire it for it is hard to acquire it is dearly bought it is won slowly by long labor
for we must love not only occasionally for a moment but for ever every one can love occasionally even the wicked can
my brother asked the birds to forgive him that sounds senseless but it is right for all is like an ocean all is flowing and blending a touch in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth
it may be senseless to beg forgiveness of the birds but birds would be happier at your side a little happier anyway and child and all animals if you were nobler than you are now
then you would pray to the birds too consumed by an all embracing love in a sort of transport and pray that they too will forgive you your sin
it all like an ocean i tell you treasure this ecstasy however senseless it may seem to man my friends pray to god for gladness
be glad as child as the birds of heaven and let not the sin of man confound you in your doings
do not say sin is mighty wickedness is mighty evil environment is mighty and we are lonely and helpless and evil environment is wearing us away and hindering our good work from being done
there is only one means of salvation then take yourself and make yourself responsible for all man sins that is the truth you know friends for as soon as you sincerely make yourself responsible for everything and for all man you will see at once that it is really so and that you are to blame for every one and for all things
but throwing your own indolence and impotence on others you will end by sharing the pride of satan and murmuring against god
of the pride of satan what i think is this it is hard for us on earth to comprehend it and therefore it is so easy to fall into error and to share it even imagining that we are doing something grand and fine
fear not that it will wear away your work and hinder its being accomplished fly from that dejection child indeed many of the strongest feeling and movements of our nature we cannot comprehend on earth
let not that be a stumbling block and think not that it may serve as a justification to you for anything for the eternal judge asks of you what you can comprehend and not what you cannot
on earth indeed we are as it were astray and if it were not for the precious image of church_of_christ before us we should be undone and altogether lost as was the human race before the flood
much on earth is hidden from us but to make up for that we have been given a precious mystic sense of our living bond with the other world with the higher heavenly world and the roots of our thoughts and feeling are not here but in other worlds
you will know that yourself hereafter for you will behold all things truly then and will not dispute them that is why the philosophers say that we cannot apprehend the reality of things on earth
god took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this earth and his garden grew up and everything came up that could come up but what grows lives and is alive only through the feeling of its contact with other mysterious worlds
if that feeling grows weak or is destroyed in you the heavenly growth will die away in you then you will be indifferent to life and even grow to hate it
that what i think can a man judge his fellow creatures faith to the end remember particularly that you cannot be a judge of any one
for no one can judge a criminal until he recognizes that he is just such a criminal as the man standing before him and that he perhaps is more than all man to blame for that crime
when he understands that he will be able to be a judge though that sounds absurd it is true if i had been righteous myself perhaps there would have been no criminal standing before me
if you can take upon yourself the crime of the criminal your heart is judging take it at once suffer for him yourself and let him go without reproach
and even if the law itself makes you his judge act in the same spirit so far as possible for he will go away and condemn himself more bitterly than you have done
if after your kiss he goes away untouched mocking at you do not let that be a stumbling block to you it shows his time has not yet come but it will come in due course
he then another in his place will understand and suffer and judge and condemn himself and the truth will be fulfilled
and if it come not no matter if not believe that believe it without doubt for in that lies all the hope and faith of the saints
if you remember in the night as you go to sleep i have not done what i ought to have done rise up at once and do it
if the people around you are spiteful and callous and will not hear you fall down before them and beg their forgiveness for in truth you are to blame for their not wanting to hear you
work without ceasing and if you cannot speak to them in their bitterness serve them in silence and in humility never losing hope
if all man abandon you and even drive you away by force then when you are left alone fall on the earth and kiss it water it with your tears and it will bring forth fruit even though no one has seen or heard you in your solitude
believe to the end even if all man went astray and you were left the only one faithful bring your offering even then and praise god in your loneliness
and if two of you are gathered together then there is a whole world a world of living love embrace each other tenderly and praise god for if only in you two his truth has been fulfilled
if you sin yourself and grieve even unto death for your sins or for your sudden sin then rejoice for others rejoice for the righteous man rejoice that if you have sinned he is righteous and has not sinned
if the evil doing of man moves you to indignation and overwhelming distress even to a desire for vengeance on the evil doers shun above all things that feeling
accept that suffering and bear it and your heart will find comfort and you will understand that you too are guilty for you might have been a light to the evil doers even as the one man sinless and you were not a light to them
if you had been a light you would have lightened the path for others too and the evil doer might perhaps have been saved by your light from his sin
and even though your light was shining yet you see man were not saved by it hold firm and doubt not the power of the heavenly light
go at once and seek suffering for yourself as though you were yourself guilty of that wrong believe that if they were not saved they will be saved hereafter
and if they are not saved hereafter then their sons will be saved for your light will not die even when you are dead
the righteous man departs but his light remains man are always saved after the death of the deliverer man reject their prophets and slay them but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain
seek no reward for great is your reward on this earth the spiritual joy which is only vouchsafed to the righteous man
you are working for the whole you are acting for the future fear not the great nor the mighty but be wise and ever serene
know the measure know the time study that when you are left alone pray love to throw yourself on the earth and kiss it
kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing consuming love love all man love everything seek that rapture and ecstasy
dont be ashamed of that ecstasy prize it for it is a gift of god and a great one it is not given to many but only to the elect
water the earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears i of hell and hell fire a mystic reflection fathers and teachers
once in infinite existence immeasurable in time and space a spiritual creature was given on his coming to earth the power of saying i am and i love
once only once there was given him a moment of active living love and for that was earthly life given him and with it time and seasons
i ponder what is hell i maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love and that happy creature rejected the priceless gift prized it and loved it not scorned it and remained callous
such a one having left the earth sees abraham bosom and talks with abraham as we are told in the parable of the rich man and lazarus and beholds heaven and can go up to the lord
but that is just his torment to rise up to the lord without ever having loved to be brought close to those who have loved when he has despised their love
for he sees clearly and says to himself now i have understanding and though i now thirst to love there will be nothing great no sacrifice in my love for my earthly life is over and abraham will not come even with a drop of living water that is the gift of earthly active life to cool the fiery thirst of spiritual love which burns in me now though i despised it on earth there is no more life for me and will be no more time
even though i would gladly give my life for others it can never be for that life is passed which can be sacrificed for love and now there is a gulf fixed between that life and this existence
but i think if there were fire in material sense they would be glad of it for i imagine that in material agony their still greater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a moment
they talk of hell fire in the material sense i dont go into that mystery and i shun it moreover that spiritual agony cannot be taken from them for that suffering is not external but within them
for even if the righteous in paradise forgave them beholding their torments and called them up to heaven in their infinite love they would only multiply their torments for they would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirst for responsive active and grateful love which is now impossible
in the timidity of my heart i imagine however that the very recognition of this impossibility would serve at last to console them
for accepting the love of the righteous together with the impossibility of repaying it by this submissiveness and the effect of this humility they will attain at last as it were to a certain semblance of that active love which they scorned in life to something like its outward expression
and if it could be taken from them i think it would be bitterer still for the unhappy creatures i am sorry friends and brothers that i cannot express this clearly
but woe to those who have slain themselves on earth woe to the suicides i believe that there can be none more miserable then they
they tell us that it is a sin to pray for them and outwardly the church_of_christ as it were renounces them but in my secret heart i believe that we may pray even for them
for such as those i have prayed inwardly all my life i confess it fathers and teachers and even now i pray for them every day
oh there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell in spite of their certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute truth there are some fearful ones who have given themselves over to satan and his proud spirit entirely
love can never be an offense to church_of_christ for such hell is voluntary and ever consuming they are tortured by their own choice
for they have cursed themselves cursing god and life they live upon their vindictive pride like a starving man in the desert sucking blood out of his own body
they cannot behold the living god without hatred and they cry out that the god of life should be annihilated that god should destroy himself and his own creation
but they are never satisfied and they refuse forgiveness they curse god who calls them and they will burn in the fire of their own wrath for ever and yearn for death and annihilation
but they will not attain to death here alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov manuscript ends i repeat it is incomplete and fragmentary
biographical details for instance cover only father_zossima earliest youth of his teaching and opinions we find brought together sayings evidently uttered on very different occasions
his utterances during the last few hours have not been kept separate from the rest but their general character can be gathered from what we have in alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov manuscript
for although those who were gathered about him that last evening realized that his death was approaching yet it was difficult to imagine that it would come so suddenly
on the contrary his friends as i observed already seeing him that night apparently so cheerful and talkative were convinced that there was at least a temporary change for the better in his condition
the elder death came in the end quite unexpectedly even five minutes before his death they said afterwards wonderingly it was impossible to foresee it
he seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain in his chest he turned pale and pressed his hands to his heart
but though suffering he still looked at them with a smile sank slowly from his chair on to his knees then bowed his face to the ground stretched out his arms and as though in joyful ecstasy praying and kissing the ground quietly and joyfully gave up his soul to god
all rose from their seats and hastened to him the news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and reached the monastery
the nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual and all the monks gathered together in the church_of_christ
by the morning all the town was talking of the event and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery
but this subject will be treated in the next book i will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected so strange upsetting and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople that after all these years that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town
and before dawn the news of the death reached the town part iii book vii alyosha_karamazov chapter i the breath of corruption
the body of father_zossima was prepared for burial according to the established ritual as is well known the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed
in the words of the church_of_christ ritual if any one of the monks depart in the lord the monk designated that is whose office it is shall wipe the body with warm water making first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased on the breast on the hands and feet and on the knees and that is enough
all this was done by father_zossima father_paďssy who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and wrapped him in his cloak which was according to custom somewhat slit to allow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross
on his head he put a hood with an eight cornered cross the hood was left open and the dead man face was covered with black gauze
in his hands was put an ikon of the saviour towards morning he was put in the coffin which had been made ready long before
it was decided to leave the coffin all day in the cell in the larger room in which the elder used to receive his visitors and fellow monks
as the deceased was a priest and monk of the strictest rule the gospel not the psalter had to be read over his body by monks in holy orders
father_zossima father_paďssy desired later on to read the gospel all day and night over his dead friend but for the present he as well as the father_zossima superintendent of the hermitage was very busy and occupied for something extraordinary an unheard of even unseemly excitement and impatient expectation began to be apparent in the monks and the visitors from the monastery hostels and the crowds of people flocking from the town
the reading was begun by father_zossima iosif immediately after the requiem service and as time went on this grew more and more marked
when it was fully daylight some people began bringing their sick in most cases child with them from the town as though they had been waiting expressly for this moment to do so evidently persuaded that the dead elder remains had a power of healing which would be immediately made manifest in accordance with their faith
it was only then apparent how unquestionably every one in our town had accepted father_zossima during his lifetime as a great saint
both the superintendent and father_zossima father_paďssy did their utmost to calm the general bustle and agitation and those who came were far from being all of the humbler classes
this intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with such haste such openness even with impatience and almost insistence impressed father_zossima father_paďssy as unseemly
though he had long foreseen something of the sort the actual manifestation of the feeling was beyond anything he had looked for
when he came across any of the monks who displayed this excitement father_zossima father_paďssy began to reprove them such immediate expectation of something extraordinary he said shows a levity possible to worldly people but unseemly in us
yet he himself if the whole truth must be told secretly at the bottom of his heart cherished almost the same hopes and could not but be aware of it though he was indignant at the too impatient expectation around him and saw in it light mindedness and vanity
but little attention was paid him and father_zossima father_paďssy noticed it uneasily nevertheless it was particularly unpleasant to him to meet certain person whose presence aroused in him great misgivings
in the crowd in the dead man cell he noticed with inward aversion for which he immediately reproached himself the presence of mr_rakitin and of the monk from obdorsk who was still staying in the monastery
of both of them father_zossima father_paďssy felt for some reason suddenly suspicious though indeed he might well have felt the same about others
he was to be seen everywhere everywhere he was asking questions everywhere he was listening on all sides he was whispering with a peculiar mysterious air
the monk from obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in the excited crowd his expression showed the greatest impatience and even a sort of irritation
as for mr_rakitin he as appeared later had come so early to the hermitage at the special request of madame_hohlakov
as soon as that good hearted but weak minded woman who could not herself have been admitted to the hermitage waked and heard of the death of father_zossima she was overtaken with such intense curiosity that she promptly dispatched mr_rakitin to the hermitage to keep a careful look out and report to her by letter every half hour or so everything that takes place
he was particularly clever in getting round people and assuming whatever part he thought most to their taste if he detected the slightest advantage to himself from doing so
it was a bright clear day and many of the visitors were thronging about the tombs which were particularly numerous round the church_of_christ and scattered here and there about the hermitage
as he walked round the hermitage father_zossima father_paďssy remembered alyosha_karamazov and that he had not seen him for some time not since the night
and he had no sooner thought of him than he at once noticed him in the farthest corner of the hermitage garden sitting on the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago for his saintliness
he sat with his back to the hermitage and his face to the wall and seemed to be hiding behind the tombstone
going up to him father_zossima father_paďssy saw that he was weeping quietly but bitterly with his face hidden in his hands and that his whole frame was shaking with sobs
she regarded mr_rakitin as a most religious and devout young man father_zossima father_paďssy stood over him for a little
enough dear son enough dear he pronounced with feeling at last why do you weep rejoice and weep not dont you know that this is the greatest of his day
alyosha_karamazov glanced at him uncovering his face which was swollen with crying like a child but turned away at once without uttering a word and hid his face in his hands again
think only where he is now at this moment maybe it is well said father_zossima father_paďssy thoughtfully weep if you must church_of_christ has sent you those tears
your touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will serve to gladden your dear heart he added to himself walking away from alyosha_karamazov and thinking lovingly of him
he moved away quickly however for he felt that he too might weep looking at him meanwhile the time was passing the monastery services and the requiems for the dead followed in their due course
but before three clock in the afternoon that something took place to which i alluded at the end of the last book something so unexpected by all of us and so contrary to the general hope that i repeat this trivial incident has been minutely remembered to this day in our town and all the surrounding neighborhood
i may add here for myself personally that i feel it almost repulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous agitation and was such a stumbling block to many though in reality it was the most natural and trivial matter
i should of course have omitted all mention of it in my story if it had not exerted a very strong influence on the heart and soul of the chief though future hero of my story alyosha_karamazov forming a crisis and turning point in his spiritual development giving a shock to his intellect which finally strengthened it for the rest of his life and gave it a definite aim
father_zossima father_paďssy again took father_zossima iosif place by the coffin and began reading the gospel and so to return to our story
when before dawn they laid father_zossima body in the coffin and brought it into the front room the question of opening the windows was raised among those who were around the coffin
some of those present may perhaps have inwardly noticed it only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and corruption from the body of such a saint was an actual absurdity calling for compassion if not a smile for the lack of faith and the frivolity it implied
and behold soon after midday there were signs of something at first only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind
but by three clock those signs had become so clear and unmistakable that the news swiftly reached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage promptly penetrated to the monastery throwing all the monks into amazement and finally in the shortest possible time spread to the town exciting every one in it believers and unbelievers alike
the unbelievers rejoiced and as for the believers some of them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers for man love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous as the deceased elder had said in one of his exhortations
the fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin growing gradually more marked and by three clock it was quite unmistakable
in all the past history of our monastery no such scandal could be recalled and in no other circumstances could such a scandal have been possible as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately after this discovery among the very monks themselves
afterwards even many years afterwards some sensible monks were amazed and horrified when they recalled that day that the scandal could have reached such proportions
for in the past monks of very holy life had died god fearing old man whose saintliness was acknowledged by all yet from their humble coffin too the breath of corruption had come naturally as from all dead bodies but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement
of course there had been in former time saints in the monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and whose relics according to tradition showed no signs of corruption
this fact was regarded by the monks as touching and mysterious and the tradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous and as a promise by god grace of still greater glory from their tombs in the future
one such whose memory was particularly cherished was an old monk job who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five
he had been a celebrated ascetic rigid in fasting and silence and his tomb was pointed out to all visitors on their arrival with peculiar respect and mysterious hints of great hopes connected with it
but this suggestion made casually by some one was unanswered and almost unnoticed for they expected something quite different that was the very tomb on which father_zossima father_paďssy had found alyosha_karamazov sitting in the morning
another memory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous father_zossima varsonofy who was only recently dead and had preceded father_zossima in the eldership
there was a tradition that both of these had lain in their coffin as though alive that they had shown no signs of decomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy light in their faces
he was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by all the pilgrims to the monastery and some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came from their bodies
yet in spite of these edifying memories it would be difficult to explain the frivolity absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffin of father_zossima
it is my private opinion that several different causes were simultaneously at work one of which was the deeply rooted hostility to the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks
even more powerful was jealousy of the dead man saintliness so firmly established during his lifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it
for though the late elder had won over many hearts more by love than by miracles and had gathered round him a mass of loving adherents none the less in fact rather the more on that account he had awakened jealousy and
so had come to have bitter enemies secret and open not only in the monastery but in the world outside it
he did no one any harm but why do they think him so saintly and that question alone gradually repeated gave rise at last to an intense insatiable hatred of him
that i believe was why many people were extremely delighted at the smell of decomposition which came so quickly for not a day had passed since his death
at the same time there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently devoted to the elder who were almost mortified and personally affronted by this incident
as soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear the whole aspect of the monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the cell
they went in stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm the news to the crowd of other monks waiting outside
some of the latter shook their heads mournfully but others did not even care to conceal the delight which gleamed unmistakably in their malignant eye
and now no one reproached them for it no one raised his voice in protest which was strange for the majority of the monks had been devoted to the dead elder
this was how the thing happened but it seemed as though god had in this case let the minority get the upper hand for a time
visitors from outside particularly of the educated class soon went into the cell too with the same spying intent of the peasantry few went into the cell though there were crowds of them at the gates of the hermitage
after three clock the rush of worldly visitors was greatly increased and this was no doubt owing to the shocking news
people were attracted who would not otherwise have come on that day and had not intended to come and among them were some personages of high standing
but external decorum was still preserved and father_zossima father_paďssy with a stern face continued firmly and distinctly reading aloud the gospel apparently not noticing what was taking place around him though he had in fact observed something unusual long before
but at last the murmurs first subdued but gradually louder and more confident reached even him it shows god judgment is not as man father_zossima father_paďssy heard suddenly
the first to give utterance to this sentiment was a layman an elderly official from the town known to be a man of great piety
they had long before formulated this damning conclusion and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant satisfaction at that conclusion became more and more apparent every moment
soon they began to lay aside even external decorum and almost seemed to feel they had a sort of right to discard it
and for what reason can this have happened some of the monks said at first with a show of regret he had a small frame and his flesh was dried up on his bones what was there to decay
but he only repeated aloud what the monks had long been whispering it must be a sign from heaven others hastened to add and their opinion was adopted at once without protest
for it was pointed out too that if the decomposition had been natural as in the case of every dead sinner it would have been apparent later after a lapse of at least twenty four hours but this premature corruption was in excess of nature and so the finger of god was evident
gentle father_zossima iosif the librarian a great favorite of the dead man tried to reply to some of the evil speakers that this is not held everywhere alike and that the incorruptibility of the bodies of the just was not a dogma of the orthodox church_of_christ but only an opinion and that even in the most orthodox regions at athos for instance they were not greatly confounded by the smell of corruption and there the chief sign of the glorification of the saved was not bodily incorruptibility but the color of the bones when the bodies have lain many years in the earth and have decayed in it
and if the bones are yellow as wax that is the great sign that the lord has glorified the dead saint if they are not yellow but black it shows that god has not deemed him worthy of such glory that is the belief in athos a great place where the orthodox doctrine has been preserved from of old unbroken and in its greatest purity said father_zossima iosif in conclusion
it was meant for a sign this conclusion seemed irresistible but the meek father_zossima words had little effect and even provoked a mocking retort
that all pedantry and innovation no use listening to it the monks decided we stick to the old doctrine there are all sort of innovations nowadays are we to follow them all
added others we have had as many holy fathers as they had there they are among the turks they have forgotten everything
father_zossima iosif walked away grieving the more since he had put forward his own opinion with little confidence as though scarcely believing in it himself
their doctrine has long been impure and they have no bells even the most sneering added he foresaw with distress that something very unseemly was beginning and that there were positive signs of disobedience
and so it came to pass that all who loved the elder and had accepted with devout obedience the institution of the eldership
little by little all the sensible monks were reduced to silence like father_zossima iosif were all at once terribly cast down and glanced timidly in one another faces when they met
those who were hostile to the institution of elders as a novelty held up their heads proudly there was no smell of corruption from the late elder varsonofy but a sweet fragrance they recalled malignantly
but he gained that glory not because he was an elder but because he was a holy man and this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of father_zossima
his teaching was false he taught that life is a great joy and not a vale of tears said some of the more unreasonable
he followed the fashionable belief he did not recognize material fire in hell others still more unreasonable added
he was not strict in fasting allowed himself sweet things ate cherry jam with his tea lady used to send it to him
he sat in pride the most malignant declared vindictively he considered himself a saint and he took it as his due when people knelt before him
is it for a monk of strict rule to drink tea could be heard among some of the envious
and among these were some of the oldest monks strictest in their devotion genuine ascetics who had kept silent during the life of the deceased elder but now suddenly unsealed their lips
and this was terrible for their words had great influence on young monks who were not yet firm in their convictions
he abused the sacrament of confession the fiercest opponents of the institution of elders added in a malicious whisper the monk from obdorsk heard all this attentively heaving deep sighs and nodding his head
yes clearly father_zossima father_ferapont was right in his judgment yesterday and at that moment father_zossima father_ferapont himself made his appearance as though on purpose to increase the confusion
he was seldom even seen at church_of_christ and they overlooked this neglect on the ground of his craziness and did not keep him to the rules binding on all the rest
i have mentioned already that he rarely left his wooden cell by the apiary but if the whole truth is to be told they hardly had a choice about it
for it would have been discreditable to insist on burdening with the common regulations so great an ascetic who prayed day and night he even dropped asleep on his knees
if they had insisted the monks would have said he is holier than all of us and he follows a rule harder than ours
and if he does not go to church_of_christ it because he knows when he ought to he has his own rule
it was to avoid the chance of these sinful murmurs that father_zossima father_ferapont was left in peace as every one was aware father_zossima father_ferapont particularly disliked father_zossima
and now the news had reached him in his hut that god judgment is not the same as man and that something had happened which was in excess of nature
it may well be supposed that among the first to run to him with the news was the monk from obdorsk who had visited him the evening before and left his cell terror stricken
i have mentioned above that though father_zossima father_paďssy standing firm and immovable reading the gospel over the coffin could not hear nor see what was passing outside the cell he gauged most of it correctly in his heart for he knew the man surrounding him well
he was not shaken by it but awaited what would come next without fear watching with penetration and insight for the outcome of the general excitement
suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance of decorum burst on his ears the door was flung open and father_zossima father_ferapont appeared in the doorway
they did not however enter the cell but stood at the bottom of the steps waiting to see what father_zossima father_ferapont would say or do
behind him there could be seen accompanying him a crowd of monks together with many people from the town for they felt with a certain awe in spite of their audacity that he had not come for nothing
standing in the doorway father_zossima father_ferapont raised his arms and under his right arm the keen inquisitive little eye of the monk from obdorsk peeped in
he alone in his intense curiosity could not resist running up the steps after father_zossima father_ferapont the others on the contrary pressed farther back in sudden alarm when the door was noisily flung open
holding his hands aloft father_zossima father_ferapont suddenly roared casting out i cast out and turning in all directions he began at once making the sign of the cross at each of the four walls and four corners of the cell in succession
for they knew he always did this wherever he went and that he would not sit down or say a word till he had driven out the evil spirits
all who accompanied father_zossima father_ferapont immediately understood his action satan go hence satan go hence he repeated at each sign of the cross
casting out i cast out he roared again he was wearing his coarse gown girt with a rope his bare chest covered with gray hair could be seen under his hempen shirt
his feet were bare as soon as he began waving his arms the cruel irons he wore under his gown could be heard clanking
father_zossima father_paďssy paused in his reading stepped forward and stood before him waiting what have you come for worthy father_zossima
why do you offend against good order why do you disturb the peace of the flock he said at last looking sternly at him
what have i come for you ask why what is your faith shouted father_zossima father_ferapont crazily i ve come here to drive out your visitors the unclean devils
i ve come to see how many have gathered here while i have been away i want to sweep them out with a birch broom
you cast out the evil spirit but perhaps you are serving him yourself father_zossima father_paďssy went on fearlessly and who can say of himself i am holy
i would not sit in an arm chair and would not have them bow down to me as an idol thundered father_zossima father_ferapont
the dead man your saint he turned to the crowd pointing with his finger to the coffin did not believe in devils
can you father_zossima i am unclean not holy nowadays folk destroy the true faith he gave medicine to keep off the devils
and so they have become as common as spiders in the corners and now he has begun to stink himself in that we see a great sign from god
the incident he referred to was this one of the monks was haunted in his dreams and later on in waking moments by visions of evil spirits
but when that was of no use he advised him while persisting in prayer and fasting to take a special medicine
many person were shocked at the time and wagged their heads as they talked over it and most of all father_zossima father_ferapont to whom some of the censorious had hastened to report this extraordinary counsel on the part of the elder
when in the utmost terror he confided this to father_zossima the elder had advised continual prayer and rigid fasting go away father_zossima said father_zossima father_paďssy in a commanding voice it not for man to judge but for god
perhaps we see here a sign which neither you nor i nor any one of us is able to comprehend go father_zossima and do not trouble the flock
he repeated impressively he did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore the sign has come
that is clear and it a sin to hide it the fanatic carried away by a zeal that outstripped his reason would not be quieted
he was seduced by sweetmeats lady brought them to him in their pockets he sipped tea he worshiped his belly filling it with sweet things and his mind with haughty thoughts
and for this he is put to shame you speak lightly father_zossima father_paďssy too raised his voice i admire your fasting and severities but you speak lightly like some frivolous youth fickle and childish
go away father_zossima i command you father_zossima father_paďssy thundered in conclusion i will go said father_ferapont seeming somewhat taken aback but still as bitter
you learned man you are so clever you look down upon my humbleness i came hither with little learning and here i have forgotten what i did know
father_zossima father_ferapont paused and suddenly leaning his cheek on his hand despondently pronounced in a sing song voice looking at the coffin of the dead elder
to morrow they will sing over him our helper and defender a splendid anthem and over me when i die all they ll sing will be what earthly joy a little canticle
god himself has preserved me in my weakness from your subtlety father_zossima father_paďssy stood over him waiting resolutely he added with tearful regret
he shouted suddenly like a madman and with a wave of his hand he turned quickly and quickly descended the steps
the crowd awaiting him below wavered some followed him at once and some lingered for the cell was still open and father_zossima father_paďssy following father_zossima father_ferapont on to the steps stood watching him
you are proud and puffed up this is a vain place but the excited old fanatic was not completely silenced
walking twenty steps away he suddenly turned towards the setting sun raised both his arms and as though some one had cut him down fell to the ground with a loud scream
he shouted frantically stretching up his hands to the sun and falling face downwards on the ground he sobbed like a little child shaken by his tears and spreading out his arms on the ground
then all rushed up to him there were exclamations and sympathetic sobs a kind of frenzy seemed to take possession of them all
my god has conquered church_of_christ has conquered the setting sun this is the one who is a saint this is the one who is a holy man
he wouldnt be an elder he would refuse he wouldnt serve a cursed innovation he wouldnt imitate their foolery other voices chimed in at once
and it is hard to say how far they might have gone but at that moment the bell rang summoning them to service
some cried aloud losing their fear this is he who should be an elder others added malignantly all began crossing themselves at once
father_zossima father_ferapont too got up and crossing himself went back to his cell without looking round still uttering exclamations which were utterly incoherent
a few followed him but the greater number dispersed hastening to service father_zossima father_paďssy let father_zossima iosif read in his place and went down
the frantic outcries of bigots could not shake him but his heart was suddenly filled with melancholy for some special reason and he felt that
he stood still and suddenly wondered why am i sad even to dejection and immediately grasped with surprise that his sudden sadness was due to a very small and special cause
in the crowd thronging at the entrance to the cell he had noticed alyosha_karamazov and he remembered that he had felt at once a pang at heart on seeing him
can that boy mean so much to my heart now he asked himself wondering at that moment alyosha_karamazov passed him hurrying away but not in the direction of the church_of_christ
alyosha_karamazov quickly turned away his eye and dropped them to the ground and from the boy look alone father_zossima father_paďssy guessed what a great change was taking place in him at that moment
their eye met have you too fallen into temptation cried father_zossima father_paďssy can you be with those of little faith
alyosha_karamazov stood still and gazed vaguely at father_zossima father_paďssy but quickly turned his eye away again and again looked on the ground
he added mournfully he stood sideways and did not turn his face to father_zossima father_paďssy who watched him attentively
where are you hastening the bell calls to service he asked again but again alyosha_karamazov gave no answer are you leaving the hermitage
alyosha_karamazov suddenly gave a wry smile cast a strange very strange look at the father_zossima to whom his former guide the former sovereign of his heart and mind his beloved elder had confided him as he lay dying
and suddenly still without speaking waved his hand as though not caring even to be respectful and with rapid steps walked towards the gates away from the hermitage
what without asking leave without asking a blessing you will come back again murmured father_zossima father_paďssy looking after him with sorrowful surprise
a critical moment father_zossima father_paďssy of course was not wrong when he decided that his dear boy would come back again
yet i must frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clear account of that strange vague moment in the life of the young hero i love so much
chapter ii perhaps indeed to some extent he penetrated with insight into the true meaning of alyosha_karamazov spiritual condition to father_zossima father_paďssy sorrowful question are you too with those of little faith
i could of course confidently answer for alyosha_karamazov no he is not with those of little faith quite the contrary
but still the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards alyosha_karamazov thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal day of his life
if the question is asked could all his grief and disturbance have been only due to the fact that his elder body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles
indeed all his trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith i must answer without beating about the bush yes it certainly was
i would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero pure heart
i am far from intending to apologize for him or to justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth or the little progress he had made in his study or any such reason
no doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously whose love was lukewarm and whose mind was too prudent for his age and so of little value
i must declare on the contrary that i have genuine respect for the qualities of his heart such a young man might i admit have avoided what happened to my hero
but in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away by an emotion however unreasonable which springs from a great love than to be unmoved
and this is even truer in youth for a young man who is always sensible is to be suspected and is of little worth that my opinion
but reasonable people will exclaim perhaps every young man cannot believe in such a superstition and your hero is no model for others
to this i reply again yes my hero had faith a faith holy and steadfast but still i am not going to apologize for him
though i declared above and perhaps too hastily that i should not explain or justify my hero i see that some explanation is necessary for the understanding of the rest of my story
let me say then it was not a question of miracles there was no frivolous and impatient expectation of miracles in his mind
oh no not at all what he saw before all was one figure the figure of his beloved elder the figure of that holy man whom he revered with such adoration
the fact is that all the love that lay concealed in his pure young heart for every one and everything had for the past year been concentrated and perhaps wrongly so on one being his beloved elder
it is true that being had for so long been accepted by him as his ideal that all his young strength and energy could not but turn towards that ideal even to the forgetting at the moment of every one and everything
he remembered afterwards how on that terrible day he had entirely forgotten his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov about whom he had been so anxious and troubled the day before he had forgotten too to take the two hundred roubles to ilusha father_zossima though he had so warmly intended to do so the preceding evening
but again it was not miracles he needed but only the higher justice which had been in his belief outraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his heart
and what does it signify that this justice looked for by alyosha_karamazov inevitably took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by the ashes of his adored teacher
why every one in the monastery cherished the same thought and the same hope even those whose intellects alyosha_karamazov revered father_zossima father_paďssy himself for instance
and alyosha_karamazov needed no miracles at the time for the triumph of some preconceived idea and so alyosha_karamazov untroubled by doubts clothed his dreams too in the same form as all the rest
and a whole year of life in the monastery had formed the habit of this expectation in his heart but it was justice justice he thirsted for not simply miracles
and now the man who should he believed have been exalted above every one in the whole world that man instead of receiving the glory that was his due was suddenly degraded and dishonored
what for who had judged him who could have decreed this those were the questions that wrung his inexperienced and virginal heart
he could not endure without mortification without resentment even that the holiest of holy man should have been exposed to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the frivolous crowd so inferior to him
even had there been no miracles had there been nothing marvelous to justify his hopes why this indignity why this humiliation why this premature decay in excess of nature as the spiteful monks said
why this sign from heaven which they so triumphantly acclaimed in company with father_zossima father_ferapont and why did they believe they had gained the right to acclaim it
why did providence hide its face at the most critical moment so alyosha_karamazov thought it as though voluntarily submitting to the blind dumb pitiless laws of nature
that was why alyosha_karamazov heart was bleeding and of course as i have said already the sting of it all was that the man he loved above everything on earth should be put to shame and humiliated
this murmuring may have been shallow and unreasonable in my hero but i repeat again for the third time and am prepared to admit that it might be difficult to defend my feeling
i am glad that my hero showed himself not too reasonable at that moment for any man of sense will always come back to reason in time but if love does not gain the upper hand in a boy heart at such an exceptional moment when will it
i will not however omit to mention something strange which came for a time to the surface of alyosha_karamazov mind at this fatal and obscure moment
where is the finger of providence this new something was the harassing impression left by the conversation with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov which now persistently haunted alyosha_karamazov mind
at this moment it haunted him oh it was not that something of the fundamental elemental so to speak faith of his soul had been shaken
yet a vague but tormenting and evil impression left by his conversation with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov the day before suddenly revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface of his consciousness
it had begun to get dusk when mr_rakitin crossing the pine copse from the hermitage to the monastery suddenly noticed alyosha_karamazov lying face downwards on the ground under a tree not moving and apparently asleep
he loved his god and believed in him steadfastly though he was suddenly murmuring against him he went up and called him by his name
you here alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov can you have he began wondering but broke off he had meant to say can you have come to this
alyosha_karamazov did not look at him but from a slight movement mr_rakitin at once saw that he heard and understood him
what the matter he went on but the surprise in his face gradually passed into a smile that became more and more ironical
i say i ve been looking for you for the last two hours you suddenly disappeared what are you about what foolery is this
you might just look at me alyosha_karamazov raised his head sat up and leaned his back against the tree he was not crying but there was a look of suffering and irritability in his face
he did not look at mr_rakitin however but looked away to one side of him do you know your face is quite changed
there none of your famous mildness to be seen in it are you angry with some one have they been ill treating you
let me alone said alyosha_karamazov suddenly with a weary gesture of his hand still looking away from him oho so that how we are feeling
so you can shout at people like other mortals that is a come down from the angels i say alyosha_karamazov you have surprised me do you hear
i mean it it long since i ve been surprised at anything here i always took you for an educated man alyosha_karamazov at last looked at him but vaguely as though scarcely understanding what he said
can you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun to stink you dont mean to say you seriously believed that he was going to work miracles
exclaimed mr_rakitin genuinely surprised again i believed i believe i want to believe and i will believe what more do you want cried alyosha_karamazov irritably
but there so now you are in a temper with your god you are rebelling against him he hasnt given promotion he hasnt bestowed the order of merit
nothing at all my boy damn it all why no schoolboy of thirteen believes in that now eh you are a set
alyosha_karamazov gazed a long while with his eye half closed at mr_rakitin and there was a sudden gleam in his eye but not of anger with mr_rakitin
i am not rebelling against my god i simply dont accept his world alyosha_karamazov suddenly smiled a forced smile
how do you mean you dont accept the world mr_rakitin thought a moment over his answer what idiocy is this
alyosha_karamazov did not answer come enough nonsense now to business have you had anything to eat to day i dont remember
i think i have you need keeping up to judge by your face it makes one sorry to look at you
you didnt sleep all night either i hear you had a meeting in there and then all this bobbery afterwards most likely you ve had nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread
i ve got some sausage in my pocket i ve brought it from the town in case of need only you wont eat sausage
give me some i say you are going it why it a regular mutiny with barricades well my boy we must make the most of it
come to my place i shouldnt mind a drop of vodka myself i am tired to death vodka is going too far for you i suppose
or would you like some give me some vodka too hullo you surprise me brother mr_rakitin looked at him in amazement
well one way or another vodka or sausage this is a jolly fine chance and mustnt be missed come along
alyosha_karamazov got up in silence and followed mr_rakitin if your little brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov could see this wouldnt he be surprised
by the way your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov set off to moscow this morning did you know yes answered alyosha_karamazov listlessly and suddenly the image of his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov rose before his mind
but only for a minute and though it reminded him of something that must not be put off for a moment some duty some terrible obligation even that reminder made no impression on him did not reach his heart and instantly faded out of his mind and was forgotten
but a long while afterwards alyosha_karamazov remembered this your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov declared once that i was a liberal booby with no talents whatsoever
once you too could not resist letting me know i was dishonorable well i should like to see what your talents and sense of honor will do for you now
this phrase mr_rakitin finished to himself in a whisper listen he said aloud let go by the path beyond the monastery straight to the town
only fancy i ve written to tell her everything that happened and would you believe it she answered me instantly in pencil the lady has a passion for writing notes that she would never have expected such conduct from a man of such a reverend character as father_zossima
hm i ought to go to madame_hohlakov by the way that was her very word conduct she is angry too
eh you are a set stay he cried suddenly again he suddenly stopped and taking alyosha_karamazov by the shoulder made him stop too
do you know alyosha_karamazov he peeped inquisitively into his eye absorbed in a sudden new thought which had dawned on him and though he was laughing outwardly he was evidently afraid to utter that new idea aloud so difficult he still found it to believe in the strange and unexpected mood in which he now saw alyosha_karamazov
alyosha_karamazov do you know where we had better go he brought out at last timidly and insinuatingly
i dont care where you like let go to grushenka eh will you come pronounced mr_rakitin at last trembling with timid suspense
let go to grushenka alyosha_karamazov answered calmly at once and this prompt and calm agreement was such a surprise to mr_rakitin that he almost started back
he cried in amazement but seizing alyosha_karamazov firmly by the arm he led him along the path still dreading that he would change his mind
well i say they walked along in silence mr_rakitin was positively afraid to talk and how glad she will be how delighted
he muttered but lapsed into silence again and indeed it was not to please grushenka he was taking alyosha_karamazov to her
his object in this case was twofold first a revengeful desire to see the downfall of the righteous and alyosha_karamazov fall from the saints to the sinners over which he was already gloating in his imagination and in the second place he had in view a certain material gain for himself of which more will be said later
so the critical moment has come he thought to himself with spiteful glee and we shall catch it on the hop for it just what we want
an onion grushenka lived in the busiest part of the town near the cathedral square in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard belonging to the house of the widow morozov
he was a practical person and never undertook anything without a prospect of gain for himself chapter iii the house was a large stone building of two stories old and very ugly
she had no need to let her lodge but every one knew that she had taken in grushenka as a lodger four years before solely to please her kinsman the merchant mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov who was known to be the girl protector
it was said that the jealous old man object in placing his favorite with the widow morozov was that the old woman should keep a sharp eye on her new lodger conduct
but this sharp eye soon proved to be unnecessary and in the end the widow morozov seldom met grushenka and did not worry her by looking after her in any way
it is true that four years had passed since the old man had brought the slim delicate shy timid dreamy and sad girl of eighteen from the chief town of the province and much had happened since then
the widow led a secluded life with her two unmarried nieces who were also elderly women little was known of the girl history in the town and that little was vague
nothing more had been learnt during the last four years even after many person had become interested in the beautiful young woman into whom agrafena_alexandrovna had meanwhile developed
there were rumor that she had been at seventeen betrayed by some one some sort of officer and immediately afterwards abandoned by him
it was said however that though grushenka had been raised from destitution by the old man mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov she came of a respectable family belonging to the clerical class that she was the daughter of a deacon or something of the sort
and now after four years the sensitive injured and pathetic little orphan had become a plump rosy beauty of the russian type a woman of bold and determined character proud and insolent
she had a good head for business was acquisitive saving and careful and by fair means or foul had succeeded it was said in amassing a little fortune
the officer had gone away and afterwards married while grushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace there was only one point on which all were agreed
grushenka was not easily to be approached and except her aged protector there had not been one man who could boast of her favors during those four years
it was a positive fact for there had been a good many especially during the last two years who had attempted to obtain those favors
but all their efforts had been in vain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an undignified and even comic retreat owing to the firm and ironical resistance they met from the strong willed young person
especially of late been given to what is called speculation and that she had shown marked abilities in that direction so that many people began to say that she was no better than a jew
it was not that she lent money on interest but it was known for instance that she had for some time past in partnership with old alyosha_karamazov actually invested in the purchase of bad debts for a trifle a tenth of their nominal value and afterwards had made out of them ten time their value
it was known too that the young person had the old widower mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov a man of large fortune was stingy and merciless
he tyrannized over his grown up sons but for the last year during which he had been ill and lost the use of his swollen legs he had fallen greatly under the influence of his protégée whom he had at first kept strictly and in humble surroundings on lenten fare as the wits said at the time
the old man now long since dead had had a large business in his day and was also a noteworthy character miserly and hard as flint
though grushenka hold upon him was so strong that he could not live without her it had been so especially for the last two years he did not settle any considerable fortune on her and would not have been moved to do so if she had threatened to leave him
but he had presented her with a small sum and even that was a surprise to every one when it became known
you are a wench with brains he said to her when he gave her eight thousand roubles and you must look after yourself but let me tell you that except your yearly allowance as before you ll get nothing more from me to the day of my death and i ll leave you nothing in my will either
and he kept his word he died and left everything to his sons whom with their wives and child he had treated all his life as servants
but grushenka had succeeded in emancipating herself while she established in him a boundless belief in her fidelity grushenka was not even mentioned in his will
all this became known afterwards he helped grushenka with his advice to increase her capital and put business in her way
when fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who first came into contact with grushenka over a piece of speculation ended to his own surprise by falling madly in love with her old mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov gravely ill as he was was immensely amused
it is remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man and he seems to have been the only person in the world with whom she was so
of late when dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov too had come on the scene with his love the old man left off laughing on the contrary he once gave grushenka a stern and earnest piece of advice
if you have to choose between the two father_zossima or son you better choose the old man if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand
these were the very words of the old profligate who felt already that his death was not far off and who actually died five months later
i will note too in passing that although many in our town knew of the grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the karamazovs father_zossima and son the object of which was grushenka scarcely any one understood what really underlay her attitude to both of them
even grushenka two servants after the catastrophe of which we will speak later testified in court that she received dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov simply from fear because he threatened to murder her
these servants were an old cook invalidish and almost deaf who came from grushenka old home and her granddaughter a smart young girl of twenty who performed the duties of a maid
but dont keep on with the captain you ll get no good out of that grushenka lived very economically and her surroundings were anything but luxurious
her lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany furniture in the fashion of belonging to her landlady it was quite dark when mr_rakitin and alyosha_karamazov entered her rooms yet they were not lighted up
grushenka was lying down in her drawing room on the big hard clumsy sofa with a mahogany back the sofa was covered with shabby and ragged leather
under her head she had two white down pillows taken from her bed she was lying stretched out motionless on her back with her hands behind her head
she was dressed as though expecting some one in a black silk dress with a dainty lace fichu on her head which was very becoming
over her shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned with a massive gold brooch she certainly was expecting some one she lay
as though impatient and weary her face rather pale and her lips and eye hot restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip of her right foot
from the hall they could hear grushenka leap up from the sofa and cry out in a frightened voice who there
the appearance of mr_rakitin and alyosha_karamazov caused a slight excitement but the maid met the visitors and at once called back to her mistress
it not he it nothing only other visitors what can be the matter muttered mr_rakitin leading alyosha_karamazov into the drawing room
a thick coil of her dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering and fell on her right shoulder but she did not notice it and did not put it back till she had gazed at her visitors and recognized them
grushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed ah it you mr_rakitin you quite frightened me whom have you brought
do send for candles said mr_rakitin with the free and easy air of a most intimate friend who is privileged to give orders in the house
who is this with you good heavens you have brought him she exclaimed recognizing alyosha_karamazov candles of course candles
she exclaimed again nodding towards alyosha_karamazov and turning to the looking glass she began quickly fastening up her hair with both hands
fenya fetch him a candle well you have chosen a moment to bring him she seemed displeased havent i managed to please you
asked mr_rakitin instantly almost offended you frightened me mr_rakitin that what it is grushenka turned with a smile to alyosha_karamazov
dont be afraid of me my dear alyosha_karamazov you cannot think how glad i am to see you my unexpected visitor
but you frightened me mr_rakitin i thought it was mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov breaking in you see i deceived him just now i made him promise to believe me
i told him that i was going to spend the evening with my old man mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch and should be there till late counting up his money
we lock ourselves in and he counts on the reckoning beads while i sit and put things down in the book
and i told him a lie i always spend one whole evening a week with him making up his accounts i am the only person he trusts
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov believes that i am there but i came back and have been sitting locked in here expecting some news how was it fenya let you in
fenya fenya run out to the gate open it and look about whether the captain is to be seen perhaps he is hiding and spying i am dreadfully frightened
there no one there agrafena_alexandrovna i ve just looked out i keep running to peep through the crack i am in fear and trembling myself
are the shutters fastened fenya and we must draw the curtains that better she drew the heavy curtains herself
he rush in at once if he saw a light i am afraid of your brother mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to day alyosha_karamazov
grushenka spoke aloud and though she was alarmed she seemed very happy about something why are you so afraid of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to day
inquired mr_rakitin i should have thought you were not timid with him you twist him round your little finger
i tell you i am expecting news priceless news so i dont want mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at all and he didnt believe i feel he didnt that i should stay at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch
he must be in his ambush now behind fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in the garden watching for me and if he there he wont come here so much the better
i told him i should stay there till midnight and i asked him to be sure to come at midnight to fetch me home
but i really have been to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov escorted me there he went away and i sat ten minutes with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch and came back here again
ugh i was afraid i ran for fear of meeting him and why are you so dressed up what a curious cap you ve got on
how curious you are yourself mr_rakitin i tell you i am expecting a message if the message comes i shall fly i shall gallop away and you will see no more of me
that why i am dressed up so as to be ready and where are you flying to if you know too much you ll get old too soon
upon my word you are highly delighted i ve never seen you like this before you are dressed up as if you were going to a ball
mr_rakitin looked her up and down much you know about balls and do you know much about them
i have seen a ball the year before last mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch son was married and i looked on from the gallery
do you suppose i want to be talking to you mr_rakitin while a prince like this is standing here such a visitor
alyosha_karamazov my dear boy i gaze at you and cant believe my eye good heavens can you have come here to see me
to tell you the truth i never had a thought of seeing you and i didnt think that you would ever come and see me
though this is not the moment now i am awfully glad to see you sit down on the sofa here that right my bright young moon
i really cant take it in even now eh mr_rakitin if only you had brought him yesterday or the day before
but i am glad as it is perhaps it better he has come now at such a moment and not the day before yesterday
she gayly sat down beside alyosha_karamazov on the sofa looking at him with positive delight and she really was glad she was not lying when she said so
her eye glowed her lips laughed but it was a good hearted merry laugh alyosha_karamazov had not expected to see such a kind expression in her face
he had hardly met her till the day before he had formed an alarming idea of her and had been horribly distressed the day before by the spiteful and treacherous trick she had played on katerina_ivanovna
he was greatly surprised to find her now altogether different from what he had expected and crushed as he was by his own sorrow his eye involuntarily rested on her with attention
her whole manner seemed changed for the better since yesterday there was scarcely any trace of that mawkish sweetness in her speech of that voluptuous softness in her movements
everything was simple and good natured her gestures were rapid direct confiding but she was greatly excited dear me how everything comes together to day
she chattered on again and why i am so glad to see you alyosha_karamazov i couldnt say myself if you ask me i couldnt tell you
come dont you know why you re glad said mr_rakitin grinning you used to be always pestering me to bring him you some object i suppose
i had a different object once but now that over this is not the moment i say i want you to have something nice
i am so good natured now you sit down too mr_rakitin why are you standing you ve sat down already there no fear of mr_rakitin forgetting to look after himself
look alyosha_karamazov he sitting there opposite us so offended that i didnt ask him to sit down before you ugh mr_rakitin is such a one to take offense
laughed grushenka dont be angry mr_rakitin i kind to day why are you so depressed alyosha_karamazov are you afraid of me
she peeped into his eye with merry mockery he sad the promotion has not been given boomed mr_rakitin what promotion
his elder stinks what you are talking some nonsense you want to say something nasty be quiet you stupid
she suddenly skipped forward and jumped laughing on his knee like a nestling kitten with her right arm about his neck
let me sit on your knee alyosha_karamazov like this i ll cheer you up my pious boy yes really will you let me sit on your knee
he sat afraid to move he heard her words if you tell me i ll get off but he did not answer
but there was nothing in his heart such as mr_rakitin for instance watching him malignantly from his corner might have expected or fancied
the great grief in his heart swallowed up every sensation that might have been aroused and if only he could have thought clearly at that moment he would have realized that he had now the strongest armor to protect him from every lust and temptation
yet in spite of the vague irresponsiveness of his spiritual condition and the sorrow that overwhelmed him he could not help wondering at a new and strange sensation in his heart
this woman this dreadful woman had no terror for him now none of that terror that had stirred in his soul at any passing thought of woman
on the contrary this woman dreaded above all women sitting now on his knee holding him in her arms aroused in him now a quite different unexpected peculiar feeling a feeling of the intensest and purest interest without a trace of fear of his former terror
you wont be angry if you tell me i ll get off alyosha_karamazov did not speak that was what instinctively surprised him
you ve talked nonsense enough cried mr_rakitin you much better give us some champagne you owe it me you know you do
yes i really do do you know alyosha_karamazov i promised him champagne on the top of everything if he bring you
i ll have some too fenya fenya bring us the bottle mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov left look sharp though i am so stingy i ll stand a bottle not for you
mr_rakitin you re a toadstool but he is a falcon and though my heart is full of something very different so be it i ll drink with you
i long for some dissipation but what is the matter with you and what is this message may i ask or is it a secret
mr_rakitin put in inquisitively doing his best to pretend not to notice the snubs that were being continually aimed at him
ech it not a secret and you know it too grushenka said in a voice suddenly anxious turning her head towards mr_rakitin and drawing a little away from alyosha_karamazov though she still sat on his knee with her arm round his neck
my officer is coming mr_rakitin my officer is coming i heard he was coming but is he so near
he is at mokroe now he ll send a messenger from there so he wrote i got a letter from him to day
i am expecting the messenger every minute you dont say so why at mokroe that a long story i ve told you enough
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ll be up to something now i say does he know or doesnt he he know of course he doesnt
if he knew there would be murder but i am not afraid of that now i am not afraid of his knife
be quiet mr_rakitin dont remind me of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he has bruised my heart and i dont want to think of that at this moment
i can think of alyosha_karamazov here i can look at alyosha_karamazov smile at me dear cheer up smile at my foolishness at my pleasure
and you know alyosha_karamazov i ve been thinking all this time you were angry with me because of the day before yesterday because of that young lady
ah he smiling he smiling how kindly he looks at me i was a cur that the truth but it a good thing it happened so
it was a horrid thing but a good thing too grushenka smiled dreamily and a little cruel line showed in her smile
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov told me that she screamed out that i ought to be flogged i did insult her dreadfully she sent for me she wanted to make a conquest of me to win me over with her chocolate
no it a good thing it did end like that she smiled again but i am still afraid of your being angry
yes that really true mr_rakitin put in suddenly with genuine surprise alyosha_karamazov she is really afraid of a chicken like you
he is a chicken to you mr_rakitin because you ve no conscience that what it is you see i love him with all my soul
that how it is alyosha_karamazov do you believe i love you with all my soul ah you shameless woman she is making you a declaration alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov
well what of it i love him and what about your officer and the priceless message from mokroe that is quite different
that a woman way of looking at it dont you make me angry mr_rakitin grushenka caught him up hotly
this is quite different i love alyosha_karamazov in a different way it true alyosha_karamazov i had sly design on you before
for i am a horrid violent creature but at other time i ve looked upon you alyosha_karamazov as my conscience i ve kept thinking how any one like that must despise a nasty thing like me
i have thought of you a long time in that way alyosha_karamazov and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov knows i ve talked to him about it
i thought that the day before yesterday as i ran home from the young lady mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov understands would you believe it i sometimes look at you and feel ashamed utterly ashamed of myself
and how and since when i began to think about you like that i cant say i dont remember fenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three glasses of champagne on the table
here the champagne cried mr_rakitin you re excited agrafena_alexandrovna and not yourself when you ve had a glass of champagne you ll be ready to dance
eh they cant even do that properly he added looking at the bottle the old woman poured it out in the kitchen and the bottle been brought in warm and without a cork
well let me have some anyway he went up to the table took a glass emptied it at one gulp and poured himself out another
one doesnt often stumble upon champagne he said licking his lips now alyosha_karamazov take a glass show what you can do
what shall we drink to the gates of paradise take a glass grushenka you drink to the gates of paradise too
what gates of paradise she took a glass alyosha_karamazov took his tasted it and put it back no i better not he smiled gently
and you bragged cried mr_rakitin well if so i wont either chimed in grushenka i really dont want any
you can drink the whole bottle alone mr_rakitin if alyosha_karamazov has some i will what touching sentimentality said mr_rakitin tauntingly and she sitting on his knee too
he got something to grieve over but what the matter with you he is rebelling against his god and ready to eat sausage
how so his elder died to day father_zossima the saint so father_zossima is dead cried grushenka
good god i did not know she crossed herself devoutly goodness what have i been doing sitting on his knee like this at such a moment
she started up as though in dismay instantly slipped off his knee and sat down on the sofa alyosha_karamazov bent a long wondering look upon her and a light seemed to dawn in his face
mr_rakitin he said suddenly in a firm and loud voice dont taunt me with having rebelled against god i dont want to feel angry with you so you must be kinder too
i ve lost a treasure such as you have never had and you cannot judge me now you had much better look at her do you see how she has pity on me
i came here to find a wicked soul i felt drawn to evil because i was base and evil myself and i ve found a true sister i have found a treasure a loving heart
she had pity on me just now agrafena_alexandrovna i am speaking of you you ve raised my soul from the depths
alyosha_karamazov lips were quivering and he caught his breath she has saved you it seems laughed mr_rakitin spitefully
and she meant to get you in her clutches do you realize that stay mr_rakitin grushenka jumped up
hush both of you now i ll tell you all about it hush alyosha_karamazov your words make me ashamed for i am bad and not good that what i am
i had the low idea of trying to get him in my clutches but now you are lying now it all different
and you hush mr_rakitin because you are telling lies and dont let me hear anything more from you mr_rakitin all this grushenka said with extreme emotion
they are both crazy said mr_rakitin looking at them with amazement i feel as though i were in a madhouse
they re both getting so feeble they ll begin crying in a minute i shall begin to cry i shall repeated grushenka
he called me his sister and i shall never forget that only let me tell you mr_rakitin though i am bad i did give away an onion
he was aggrieved and annoyed though he might have reflected that each of them was just passing through a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a lifetime
but though mr_rakitin was very sensitive about everything that concerned himself he was very obtuse as regards the feeling and sensations of others partly from his youth and inexperience partly from his intense egoism
an onion hang it all you really are crazy mr_rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm you see alyosha_karamazov grushenka turned to him with a nervous laugh
i was boasting when i told mr_rakitin i had given away an onion but it not to boast i tell you about it
it only a story but it a nice story i used to hear it when i was a child from matryona my cook who is still with me
it like this once upon a time there was a peasant woman and a very wicked woman she was and she died and did not leave a single good deed behind
so her guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of her he could remember to tell to god she once pulled up an onion in her garden said he and gave it to a beggar woman
and god answered you take that onion then hold it out to her in the lake and let her take hold and be pulled out
and if you can pull her out of the lake let her come to paradise but if the onion breaks then the woman must stay where she is
the devils caught her and plunged her into the lake of fire the angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her
he had just pulled her right out when the other sinners in the lake seeing how she was being drawn out began catching hold of her so as to be pulled out with her
come said he catch hold and i ll pull you out and he began cautiously pulling her out but she was a very wicked woman and she began kicking them
i to be pulled out not you it my onion not yours as soon as she said that the onion broke
and the woman fell into the lake and she is burning there to this day so the angel wept and went away
i boasted to mr_rakitin that i had given away an onion but to you i ll say i ve done nothing but give away one onion all my life
so that the story alyosha_karamazov i know it by heart for i am that wicked woman myself that the only good deed i ve done
so dont praise me alyosha_karamazov dont think me good i am bad i am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you praise me
i was so anxious to get hold of you that i promised mr_rakitin twenty five roubles if he would bring you to me
she went with rapid steps to the table opened a drawer pulled out a purse and took from it a twenty five rouble note
eh i must confess everything listen alyosha_karamazov stay mr_rakitin wait what nonsense what nonsense cried mr_rakitin disconcerted take it
mr_rakitin i owe it you there no fear of your refusing it you asked for it yourself and she threw the note to him
likely i should refuse it boomed mr_rakitin obviously abashed but carrying off his confusion with a swagger that will come in very handy fools are made for wise man profit
and now hold your tongue mr_rakitin what i am going to say now is not for your ears sit down in that corner and keep quiet
you dont like us so hold your tongue what should i like you for mr_rakitin snarled not concealing his ill humor
he had reckoned on receiving his payment later without alyosha_karamazov knowing of it and now feeling ashamed he lost his temper
till that moment he had thought it discreet not to contradict grushenka too flatly in spite of her snubbing since he had something to get out of her
he put the twenty five rouble note in his pocket and he felt ashamed at alyosha_karamazov seeing it but now he too was angry
one loves people for some reason but what have either of you done for me you should love people without a reason as alyosha_karamazov does
grushenka was standing in the middle of the room she spoke with heat and there were hysterical notes in her voice
how does he love you how has he shown it that you make such a fuss about it hush mr_rakitin you know nothing about us
and dont dare to speak to me like that again how dare you be so familiar sit in that corner and be quiet as though you were my footman
and now alyosha_karamazov i ll tell you the whole truth that you may see what a wretch i am i am not talking to mr_rakitin but to you
i wanted to ruin you alyosha_karamazov that the holy truth i quite meant to i wanted to so much that i bribed mr_rakitin to bring you
and why did i want to do such a thing you knew nothing about it alyosha_karamazov you turned away from me if you passed me you dropped your eye
and i ve looked at you a hundred time before to day i began asking every one about you your face haunted my heart
he despises me i thought he wont even look at me and i felt it so much at last that i wondered at myself for being so frightened of a boy
i ll get him in my clutches and laugh at him i was full of spite and anger would you believe it nobody here dares talk or think of coming to agrafena_alexandrovna with any evil purpose
old mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov is the only man i have anything to do with here i was bound and sold to him satan brought us together but there has been no one else
but looking at you i thought i ll get him in my clutches and laugh at him you see what a spiteful cur i am and you called me your sister
and now that man who wronged me has come i sit here waiting for a message from him and do you know what that man has been to me
five years ago when mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov brought me here i used to shut myself up that no one might have sight or sound of me
i was a silly slip of a girl i used to sit here sobbing i used to lie awake all night thinking where is he now the man who wronged me
he is laughing at me with another woman most likely if only i could see him if i could meet him again i pay him out i pay him out
at night i used to lie sobbing into my pillow in the dark and i used to brood over it i used to tear my heart on purpose and gloat over my anger
and when i suddenly thought that i should really do nothing to him and that he was laughing at me then or perhaps had utterly forgotten me i would fling myself on the floor melt into helpless tears and lie there shaking till dawn
i ll pay him out i ll pay him out that what i used to cry out in the dark in the morning i would get up more spiteful than a dog ready to tear the whole world to pieces
no no one in the whole world sees it no one knows it but when night comes on i sometimes lie as i did five years ago when i was a silly girl clenching my teeth and crying all night thinking i ll pay him out i ll pay him out
and then what do you think i began saving money i became hard hearted grew stout grew wiser would you say do you hear
well then now you understand me a month ago a letter came to me he was coming he was a widower he wanted to see me
it took my breath away then i suddenly thought if he comes and whistles to call me i shall creep back to him like a beaten dog
and i ve been in such a rage with myself all this month that i am worse than i was five years ago
i couldnt believe myself am i so abject shall i run to him or not do you see now alyosha_karamazov what a violent vindictive creature i am
i have shown you the whole truth i played with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to keep me from running to that other hush mr_rakitin it not for you to judge me i am not speaking to you
before you came in i was lying here waiting brooding deciding my whole future life and you can never know what was in my heart
yes alyosha_karamazov tell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happened the day before yesterday nobody in the whole world knows what i am going through now and no one ever can know
and at this tragic phrase grushenka broke down hid her face in her hands flung herself on the sofa pillows and sobbed like a little child
for perhaps i shall take a knife with me to day i cant make up my mind alyosha_karamazov got up and went to mr_rakitin
misha he said dont be angry she wounded you but dont be angry you heard what she said just now
you mustnt ask too much of human endurance one must be merciful alyosha_karamazov said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart
he felt obliged to speak and he turned to mr_rakitin if mr_rakitin had not been there he would have spoken to the air
you were so primed up with your elder teaching last night that now you have to let it off on me alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov man of god said mr_rakitin with a smile of hatred
but mr_rakitin looked at him ironically and alyosha_karamazov stopped short dont laugh mr_rakitin dont smile dont talk of the dead he was better than any one in the world
cried alyosha_karamazov with tears in his voice i didnt speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the judged
in my cowardliness but she after five years in torment as soon as any one says a word from the heart to her it makes her forget everything forgive everything in her tears
the man who has wronged her has come back he sends for her and she forgives him everything and hastens joyfully to meet him
what am i beside her i came here seeking my ruin and said to myself what does it matter and she wont take a knife with her
she wont no i am not like that i dont know whether you are misha but i am not like that
it a lesson to me she is more loving than we have you heard her speak before of what she has just told us
no you havent if you had you have understood her long ago and the person insulted the day before yesterday must forgive her too
she will when she knows and she shall know this soul is not yet at peace with itself one must be tender with it there may be a treasure in that soul
alyosha_karamazov stopped because he caught his breath in spite of his ill humor mr_rakitin looked at him with astonishment he had never expected such a tirade from the gentle alyosha_karamazov
she found some one to plead her cause why are you in love with her agrafena_alexandrovna our monk really in love with you
you ve made a conquest he cried with a coarse laugh grushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at alyosha_karamazov with a tender smile shining on her tear stained face
let him alone alyosha_karamazov my cherub you see what he is he is not a person for you to speak to
mihail_makarovitch osipovitch she turned to mr_rakitin i meant to beg your pardon for being rude to you but now i dont want to
alyosha_karamazov come to me sit down here she beckoned to him with a happy smile that right sit here
tell me she shook him by the hand and peeped into his face smiling tell me do i love that man or not
the man who wronged me do i love him or not before you came i lay here in the dark asking my heart whether i loved him
decide for me alyosha_karamazov the time has come it shall be as you say am i to forgive him or not
but you have forgiven him already said alyosha_karamazov smiling yes i really have forgiven him grushenka murmured thoughtfully
she snatched up a glass from the table emptied it at a gulp lifted it in the air and flung it on the floor
what an abject heart to my abject heart the glass broke with a crash a little cruel line came into her smile
perhaps i havent forgiven him though she said with a sort of menace in her voice and she dropped her eye to the ground as though she were talking to herself
perhaps my heart is only getting ready to forgive i shall struggle with my heart you see alyosha_karamazov i ve grown to love my tears in these five years
perhaps i only love my resentment not him well i shouldnt care to be in his shoes hissed mr_rakitin
well you wont be mr_rakitin you ll never be in his shoes you shall black my shoes mr_rakitin that the place you are fit for
you ll never get a woman like me and he wont either perhaps wont he then why are you dressed up like that said mr_rakitin with a venomous sneer
if i choose to tear off my finery i ll tear it off at once this minute she cried in a resonant voice
dont taunt me with dressing up mr_rakitin you dont know all that is in my heart you dont know what that finery is for mr_rakitin
perhaps i shall see him and say have you ever seen me look like this before he left me a thin consumptive cry baby of seventeen
i ll sit by him fascinate him and work him up do you see what i am like now i ll say to him
well and that enough for you my dear sir there many a slip twixt the cup and the lip that may be what the finery is for mr_rakitin
i violent and resentful alyosha_karamazov i ll tear off my finery i ll destroy my beauty i ll scorch my face slash it with a knife and turn beggar
if i choose i ll send mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov back all he has ever given me to morrow and all his money and i ll go out charing for the rest of my life
grushenka finished with a malicious laugh if i choose i wont go anywhere now to see any one you think i wouldnt do it mr_rakitin that i would not dare to do it
i would i would i could do it directly only dont exasperate me and i ll send him about his business i ll snap my fingers in his face he shall never see me again
she uttered the last words in an hysterical scream but broke down again hid her face in her hands buried it in the pillow and shook with sobs
mr_rakitin got up it time we were off he said it late we shall be shut out of the monastery
grushenka leapt up from her place surely you dont want to go alyosha_karamazov she cried in mournful surprise
what are you doing to me you ve stirred up my feeling tortured me and now you ll leave me to face this night alone
he can hardly spend the night with you though if he wants to let him i ll go alone mr_rakitin scoffed jeeringly
hush evil tongue grushenka cried angrily at him you never said such words to me as he has come to say
what has he said to you so special asked mr_rakitin irritably i cant say i dont know i dont know what he said to me
it went straight to my heart he has wrung my heart he is the first the only one who has pitied me that what it is
why did you not come before you angel she fell on her knees before him as though in a sudden frenzy
i ve been waiting all my life for some one like you i knew that some one like you would come and forgive me
i believed that nasty as i am some one would really love me not only with a shameful love what have i done to you
answered alyosha_karamazov bending over her with a tender smile and gently taking her by the hands i only gave you an onion nothing but a tiny little onion that was all
he was moved to tears himself as he said it at that moment there was a sudden noise in the passage some one came into the hall
fenya ran noisily into the room crying out mistress mistress darling a messenger has galloped up she cried breathless and joyful
grushenka jumped up seeming greatly alarmed a carriage from mokroe for you timofey the driver with three horses they are just putting in fresh horses
a letter here the letter mistress a letter was in her hand and she waved it in the air all the while she talked
grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to the candle it was only a note a few lines she read it in one instant
he has sent for me she cried her face white and distorted with a wan smile he whistles crawl back little dog
but only for one instant she stood as though hesitating suddenly the blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks
i will go she cried five years of my life good by good by alyosha_karamazov my fate is sealed go go leave me all of you dont let me see you again
grushenka is flying to a new life dont you remember evil against me either mr_rakitin i may be going to my death
ugh i feel as though i were drunk she suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom well she has no thoughts for us now grumbled mr_rakitin
let go or we may hear that feminine shriek again i am sick of all these tears and cries alyosha_karamazov mechanically let himself be led out
in the yard stood a covered cart horses were being taken out of the shafts man were running to and fro with a lantern
but when alyosha_karamazov and mr_rakitin reached the bottom of the steps grushenka bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after alyosha_karamazov
alyosha_karamazov give my greetings to your brother mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and tell him not to remember evil against me though i have brought him misery
three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate and tell him too in my words grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel and not to you noble heart
and add too that grushenka loved him only one hour only one short hour she loved him so let him remember that hour all his life say grushenka tells you to
she ended in a voice full of sobs the window was shut with a slam m m growled mr_rakitin laughing she murders your brother mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and then tells him to remember it all his life
what ferocity alyosha_karamazov made no reply he seemed not to have heard he walked fast beside mr_rakitin as though in a terrible hurry
he was lost in thought and moved mechanically mr_rakitin felt a sudden twinge as though he had been touched on an open wound
he had expected something quite different by bringing grushenka and alyosha_karamazov together something very different from what he had hoped for had happened
he is a pole that officer of her he began again restraining himself and indeed he is not an officer at all now
he served in the customs in siberia somewhere on the chinese frontier some puny little beggar of a pole i expect
lost his job they say he heard now that grushenka saved a little money so he turned up again that the explanation of the mystery
again alyosha_karamazov seemed not to hear mr_rakitin could not control himself well so you ve saved the sinner he laughed spitefully
have you turned the magdalene into the true path driven out the seven devils eh so you see the miracles you were looking out for just now have come to pass
hush mr_rakitin alyosha_karamazov answered with an aching heart so you despise me now for those twenty five roubles i ve sold my friend you think
but you are not church_of_christ you know and i am not judas oh mr_rakitin i assure you i forgotten about it cried alyosha_karamazov you remind me of it yourself
but this was the last straw for mr_rakitin damnation take you all and each of you he cried suddenly why the devil did i take you up
i dont want to know you from this time forward go alone there your road and he turned abruptly into another street leaving alyosha_karamazov alone in the dark
it was very late according to the monastery ideas when alyosha_karamazov returned to the hermitage the door keeper let him in by a special entrance
alyosha_karamazov came out of the town and walked across the fields to the monastery chapter iv cana of galilee it had struck nine clock the hour of rest and repose after a day of such agitation for all
there was no one in the cell but father_zossima father_paďssy reading the gospel in solitude over the coffin and the young novice porfiry who exhausted by the previous night conversation and the disturbing incidents of the day was sleeping the deep sound sleep of youth on the floor of the other room
alyosha_karamazov timidly opened the door and went into the elder cell where his coffin was now standing though father_zossima father_paďssy heard alyosha_karamazov come in he did not even look in his direction
his soul was overflowing but with mingled feeling no single sensation stood out distinctly on the contrary one drove out another in a slow continual rotation
alyosha_karamazov turned to the right from the door to the corner fell on his knees and began to pray but there was a sweetness in his heart and strange to say alyosha_karamazov was not surprised at it
again he saw that coffin before him the hidden dead figure so precious to him but the weeping and poignant grief of the morning was no longer aching in his soul
as soon as he came in he fell down before the coffin as before a holy shrine but joy joy was glowing in his mind and in his heart
the one window of the cell was open the air was fresh and cool so the smell must have become stronger if they opened the window thought alyosha_karamazov
but even this thought of the smell of corruption which had seemed to him so awful and humiliating a few hours before no longer made him feel miserable or indignant
fragments of thought floated through his soul flashed like stars and went out again at once to be succeeded by others
but yet there was reigning in his soul a sense of the wholeness of things something steadfast and comforting and he was aware of it himself
he began quietly praying but he soon felt that he was praying almost mechanically sometimes he began praying ardently he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love
but when he had begun to pray he passed suddenly to something else and sank into thought forgetting both the prayer and what had interrupted it
he began listening to what father_zossima father_paďssy was reading but worn out with exhaustion he gradually began to doze and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee read father_zossima father_paďssy
and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage marriage
what that a marriage floated whirling through alyosha_karamazov mind there is happiness for her too she has gone to the feast
no she has not taken the knife that was only a tragic phrase well tragic phrases should be forgiven they must be
tragic phrases comfort the heart without them sorrow would be too heavy for man to bear mr_rakitin has gone off to the back alley
as long as mr_rakitin broods over his wrongs he will always go off to the back alley but the high road
the road is wide and straight and bright as crystal and the sun is at the end of it ah what being read
and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine alyosha_karamazov heard
ah yes i was missing that and i didnt want to miss it i love that passage it cana of galilee the first miracle
ah that miracle ah that sweet miracle it was not man grief but their joy church_of_christ visited he worked his first miracle to help man gladness
he who loves man loves their gladness too he was always repeating that it was one of his leading ideas
there no living without joy mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov says yes mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov everything that is true and good is always full of forgiveness he used to say that too
jesus saith unto her woman what has it to do with thee or me mine hour is not yet come
his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it do it gladness the gladness of some poor very poor people
the historians write that in those day the people living about the lake of gennesaret were the poorest that can possibly be imagined and another great heart that other great being his mother knew that he had come not only to make his great terrible sacrifice
she knew that his heart was open even to the simple artless merrymaking of some obscure and unlearned people who had warmly bidden him to their poor wedding
of course they were poor since they hadnt wine enough even at a wedding mine hour is not yet come he said with a soft smile he must have smiled gently to her
and indeed was it to make wine abundant at poor weddings he had come down to earth and yet he went and did as she asked him
ah he is reading again jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water and they filled them up to the brim
and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bare it
when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when man have well drunk that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until now
but what this what this why is the room growing wider ah yes it the marriage the wedding
yes of course here are the guests here are the young couple sitting and the merry crowd and where is the wise governor of the feast
but who is this who again the walls are receding who is getting up there from the great table what he here too
but he in the coffin but he here too he has stood up he sees me he is coming here
yes he came up to him to him he the little thin old man with tiny wrinkles on his face joyful and laughing softly
there was no coffin now and he was in the same dress as he had worn yesterday sitting with them when the visitors had gathered about him
god his face was uncovered his eye were shining how was this then he too had been called to the feast
he too at the marriage of cana in galilee yes my dear i am called too called and bidden he heard a soft voice saying over him
why have you hidden yourself here out of sight you come and join us too it was his voice the voice of father_zossima
and it must be he since he called him the elder raised alyosha_karamazov by the hand and he rose from his knees
we are rejoicing the little thin old man went on we are drinking the new wine the wine of new great gladness do you see how many guests
here are the bride and bridegroom here is the wise governor of the feast he is tasting the new wine why do you wonder at me
i gave an onion to a beggar so i too am here and many here have given only an onion each only one little onion
and you my gentle one you my kind boy you too have known how to give a famished woman an onion to day
what are all our deeds begin your work dear one begin it gentle one do you see our sun do you see him
i am afraid i dare not look whispered alyosha_karamazov do not fear him he is terrible in his greatness awful in his sublimity but infinitely merciful
he has made himself like unto us from love and rejoices with us he is changing the water into wine that the gladness of the guests may not be cut short
he is expecting new guests he is calling new ones unceasingly for ever and ever there they are bringing new wine
do you see they are bringing the vessels something glowed in alyosha_karamazov heart something filled it till it ached tears of rapture rose from his soul
he stretched out his hands uttered a cry and waked up again the coffin the open window and the soft solemn distinct reading of the gospel
it was strange he had fallen asleep on his knees but now he was on his feet and suddenly as though thrown forward with three firm rapid steps he went right up to the coffin
father_zossima father_paďssy raised his eye for an instant from his book but looked away again at once seeing that something strange was happening to the boy
alyosha_karamazov gazed for half a minute at the coffin at the covered motionless dead man that lay in the coffin with the ikon on his breast and the peaked cap with the octangular cross on his head
but alyosha_karamazov did not listen to the reading his shoulder brushed against father_zossima father_paďssy without his noticing it he had only just been hearing his voice and that voice was still ringing in his ears
he did not stop on the steps either but went quickly down his soul overflowing with rapture yearned for freedom space openness
he was listening still expecting other words but suddenly he turned sharply and went out of the cell the vault of heaven full of soft shining stars stretched vast and fathomless above him
the milky way ran in two pale streams from the zenith to the horizon the fresh motionless still night enfolded the earth
the white towers and golden domes of the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphire sky the gorgeous autumn flowers in the beds round the house were slumbering till morning
the silence of earth seemed to melt into the silence of the heavens the mystery of earth was one with the mystery of the stars
alyosha_karamazov stood gazed and suddenly threw himself down on the earth he did not know why he embraced it he could not have told why he longed so irresistibly to kiss it to kiss it all
but he kissed it weeping sobbing and watering it with his tears and vowed passionately to love it to love it for ever and ever
water the earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears echoed in his soul what was he weeping over
in his rapture he was weeping even over those stars which were shining to him from the abyss of space and he was not ashamed of that ecstasy
there seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds of god linking his soul to them and it was trembling all over in contact with other worlds
oh he longed to forgive every one and for everything and to beg forgiveness oh not for himself but for all man for all and for everything
but with every instant he felt clearly and as it were tangibly that something firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered into his soul
it was as though some idea had seized the sovereignty of his mind and it was for all his life and for ever and ever
he had fallen on the earth a weak boy but he rose up a resolute champion and he knew and felt it suddenly at the very moment of his ecstasy
and others are praying for me too echoed again in his soul and never never all his life long could alyosha_karamazov forget that minute
within three day he left the monastery in accordance with the words of his elder who had bidden him sojourn in the world
some one visited my soul in that hour he used to say afterwards with implicit faith in his words
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov but dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov to whom grushenka flying away to a new life had left her last greetings bidding him remember the hour of her love for ever knew nothing of what had happened to her and was at that moment in a condition of feverish agitation and activity
for the last two day he had been in such an inconceivable state of mind that he might easily have fallen ill with brain fever as he said himself afterwards
alyosha_karamazov had not been able to find him the morning before and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had not succeeded in meeting him at the tavern on the same day
he had spent those two day literally rushing in all directions struggling with his destiny and trying to save himself as he expressed it himself afterwards and for some hours he even made a dash out of the town on urgent business terrible as it was to him to lose sight of grushenka for a moment
all this was explained afterwards in detail and confirmed by documentary evidence but for the present we will only note the most essential incidents of those two terrible day immediately preceding the awful catastrophe that broke so suddenly upon him
though grushenka had it is true loved him for an hour genuinely and sincerely yet she tortured him sometimes cruelly and mercilessly
book viii the people at his lodgings by his orders concealed his movements the worst of it was that he could never tell what she meant to do
to prevail upon her by force or kindness was also impossible she would yield to nothing she would only have become angry and turned away from him altogether he knew that well already
he suspected quite correctly that she too was passing through an inward struggle and was in a state of extraordinary indecision that she was making up her mind to something and unable to determine upon it
and so not without good reason he divined with a sinking heart that at moments she must simply hate him and his passion
and so perhaps it was but what was distressing grushenka he did not understand for him the whole tormenting question lay between him and fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
one certain fact he was firmly persuaded that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov would offer or perhaps had offered grushenka lawful wedlock and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles
that was how it was that he could believe at time that all grushenka uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose which was most to her advantage
strange to say during those day it never occurred to him to think of the approaching return of the officer that is of the man who had been such a fatal influence in grushenka life and whose arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread
here we must note by the way mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had reached this conclusion from his knowledge of grushenka and her character it is true that of late grushenka had been very silent about it
yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month ago from her seducer and had heard of it from her own lips
in a moment of spite grushenka had shown him that letter but to her astonishment he attached hardly any consequence to it
perhaps weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with his own father_zossima for this woman he was incapable of imagining any danger more terrible at any rate for the time
he simply did not believe in a suitor who suddenly turned up again after five years disappearance still less in his speedy arrival
moreover in the officer first letter which had been shown to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the possibility of his new rival visit was very vaguely suggested
he partly knew too what the letter contained it would be hard to say why this was the letter was very indefinite high flown and full of sentimentality
it must be noted that grushenka had concealed from him the last lines of the letter in which his return was alluded to more definitely
he had besides noticed at that moment he remembered afterwards a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from siberia on grushenka face
grushenka told him nothing of what had passed later between her and this rival so that by degrees he had completely forgotten the officer existence
he felt that whatever might come later whatever turn things might take his final conflict with fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was close upon him and must be decided before anything else
with a sinking heart he was expecting every moment grushenka decision always believing that it would come suddenly on the impulse of the moment
all of a sudden she would say to him take me i yours for ever and it would all be over
oh then he would bear her away at once as far far away as possible to the farthest end of russia if not of the earth then he would marry her and settle down with her incognito so that no one would know anything about them there here or anywhere
he would seize her and bear her away at once to the ends of the earth then oh then a new life would begin at once
of this different reformed and virtuous life it must it must be virtuous he dreamed feverishly at every moment he thirsted for that reformation and renewal
the filthy morass in which he had sunk of his own free will was too revolting to him and like very many man in such cases he put faith above all in change of place
if only it were not for these people if only it were not for these circumstances if only he could fly away from this accursed place he would be altogether regenerated would enter on a new path
that was what he believed in and what he was yearning for but all this could only be on condition of the first the happy solution of the question
there was another possibility a different and awful ending suddenly she might say to him go away i have just come to terms with fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
i am going to marry him and dont want you and then but then but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov did not know what would happen then
up to the last hour he didnt know that must be said to his credit he had no definite intentions had planned no crime
he was simply watching and spying in agony while he prepared himself for the first happy solution of his destiny he drove away any other idea in fact
but for that ending a quite different anxiety arose a new incidental but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself if she were to say to him i yours take me away how could he take her away
it was just at this time that all sources of revenue from fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov doles which had gone on without interruption for so many years ceased
grushenka had money of course but with regard to this mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly evinced extraordinary pride he wanted to carry her away and begin the new life with her himself at his own expense not at her
where had he the means the money to do it he could not conceive of taking her money and the very idea caused him a pang of intense repulsion
i wont enlarge on this fact or analyze it here but confine myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment
all this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of his conscience for the money of katerina_ivanovna that he had dishonestly appropriated
i ve been a scoundrel to one of them and i shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly was his feeling then as he explained after and when grushenka knows she wont care for such a scoundrel
where then was he to get the means where was he to get the fateful money without it all would be lost and nothing could be done and only because i hadnt the money
oh the shame of it to anticipate things he did perhaps know where to get the money knew perhaps where it lay at that moment
but his chief trouble i must explain however obscurely lay in the fact that to have that sum he knew of to have the right to take it he must first restore katerina_ivanovna three thousand if not
i a common pickpocket i a scoundrel and i dont want to begin a new life as a scoundrel mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov decided
and so he made up his mind to move heaven and earth to return katerina_ivanovna that three thousand and that first of all
the final stage of this decision so to say had been reached only during the last hours that is after his last interview with alyosha_karamazov two day before on the high road on the evening when grushenka had insulted katerina_ivanovna and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov after hearing alyosha_karamazov account of it had admitted that he was a scoundrel and told him to tell katerina_ivanovna so if it could be any comfort to her
after parting from his brother on that night he had felt in his frenzy that it would be better to murder and rob some one than fail to pay my debt to katya
every one thought me a robber and a murderer i rather go to siberia than that katya should have the right to say that i deceived her and stole her money and used her money to run away with grushenka and begin a new life
i will say no more of this here as it will all be clear later i rather that i cant do
so mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov decided grinding his teeth and he might well fancy at time that his brain would give way but meanwhile he went on struggling
strange to say though one would have supposed there was nothing left for him but despair for what chance had he with nothing in the world to raise such a sum yet to the very end he persisted in hoping that he would get that three thousand that the money would somehow come to him of itself as though it might drop from heaven
that is just how it is with people who like dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov have never had anything to do with money except to squander what has come to them by inheritance without any effort of their own and have no notion how money is obtained
a whirl of the most fantastic notions took possession of his brain immediately after he had parted with alyosha_karamazov two day before and threw his thoughts into a tangle of confusion
and perhaps to man of that kind in such circumstances the most impossible fantastic schemes occur first and seem most practical
he suddenly determined to go to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the merchant who was grushenka protector and to propose a scheme to him and by means of it to obtain from him at once the whole of the sum required
of the commercial value of his scheme he had no doubt not the slightest and was only uncertain how mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov would look upon his freak supposing he were to consider it from any but the commercial point of view
though mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov knew the merchant by sight he was not acquainted with him and had never spoken a word to him
but for some unknown reason he had long entertained the conviction that the old reprobate who was lying at death door would perhaps not at all object now to grushenka securing a respectable position and marrying a man to be depended upon
and he believed not only that he would not object but that this was what he desired and if opportunity arose that he would be ready to help
from some rumor or perhaps from some stray word of grushenka he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov for grushenka
possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance and being ready to take his bride so to speak from the hands of her protector dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov showed great coarseness and want of delicacy
this is how it was he pitched first on a perfectly wild enterprise i will only observe that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looked upon grushenka past as something completely over
he looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him it would mean the beginning of a new grushenka and a new dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov free from every vice
as for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of grushenka though she had never loved him and who was now himself a thing of the past completely done with and so to say non existent
besides mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hardly looked upon him as a man at all for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck whose relations with grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal and that this had been so for a long time
in any case there was much simplicity on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov part in all this for in spite of all his vices he was a very simple hearted man
it was an instance of this simplicity that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was seriously persuaded that being on the eve of his departure for the next world old mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov must sincerely repent of his past relations with grushenka and that she had no more devoted friend and protector in the world than this now harmless old man
after his conversation with alyosha_karamazov at the cross roads he hardly slept all night and at ten clock next morning he was at the house of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and telling the servant to announce him
they would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh it was a very large and gloomy old house of two stories with a lodge and outhouses
in the lower story lived mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov two married sons with their families his old sister and his unmarried daughter in the lodge lived two of his clerks one of whom also had a large family
both the lodge and the lower story were overcrowded but the old man kept the upper floor to himself and would not even let the daughter live there with him though she waited upon him and in spite of her asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours and at any time he might call her to run upstairs to him from below
this upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely for show furnished in the old fashioned merchant style with long monotonous rows of clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls with glass chandeliers under shades and gloomy mirrors on the walls
all these rooms were entirely empty and unused for the old man kept to one room a small remote bedroom where he was waited upon by an old servant with a kerchief on her head and by a lad who used to sit on the locker in the passage
owing to his swollen legs the old man could hardly walk at all and was only rarely lifted from his leather arm chair when the old woman supporting him led him up and down the room once or twice
he was morose and taciturn even with this old woman when he was informed of the arrival of the captain he at once refused to see him
but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov persisted and sent his name up again mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov questioned the lad minutely what he looked like whether he was drunk
was he going to make a row the answer he received was that he was sober but wouldnt go away the old man again refused to see him
then mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov who had foreseen this and purposely brought pencil and paper with him wrote clearly on the piece of paper the words
after thinking a little mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to the drawing room and sent the old woman downstairs with a summons to his younger son to come upstairs to him at once
this younger son a man over six foot and of exceptional physical strength who was closely shaven and dressed in the european style though his father_zossima still wore a kaftan and a beard came at once without a comment
on most important business closely concerning agrafena_alexandrovna and sent it up to the old man all the family trembled before the father_zossima
he was by no means of a timorous temper but in order to have a witness in case of any emergency
the old man had sent for this giant not because he was afraid of the captain supported by his son and the servant lad he waddled at last into the drawing room
the drawing room in which mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was awaiting him was a vast dreary room that laid a weight of depression on the heart
it had a double row of windows a gallery marbled walls and three immense chandeliers with glass lusters covered with shades
it may be assumed that he felt considerable curiosity mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was sitting on a little chair at the entrance awaiting his fate with nervous impatience
when the old man appeared at the opposite door seventy feet away mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jumped up at once and with his long military stride walked to meet him
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was well dressed in a frock coat buttoned up with a round hat and black gloves in his hands just as he had been three day before at the elder at the family meeting with his father_zossima and brothers
the old man waited for him standing dignified and unbending and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov felt at once that he had looked him through and through as he advanced
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was greatly impressed too with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov immensely swollen face his lower lip which had always been thick hung down now looking like a bun
he bowed to his guest in dignified silence motioned him to a low chair by the sofa and leaning on his son arm he began lowering himself on to the sofa opposite groaning painfully so that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov seeing his painful exertions immediately felt remorseful and sensitively conscious of his insignificance in the presence of the dignified person he had ventured to disturb
what is it you want of me sir said the old man deliberately distinctly severely but courteously when he was at last seated
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov started leapt up but sat down again then he began at once speaking with loud nervous haste gesticulating and in a positive frenzy
he was unmistakably a man driven into a corner on the brink of ruin catching at the last straw ready to sink if he failed
most honored sir mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch you have no doubt heard more than once of my disputes with my father_zossima fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov who robbed me of my inheritance from my mother seeing the whole town is gossiping about it for here every one gossiping of what they shouldnt and besides it might have reached you through grushenka
old mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov probably grasped all this in an instant though his face remained cold and immovable as a statue i beg your pardon through agrafena_alexandrovna
agrafena_alexandrovna the lady for whom i have the highest respect and esteem so mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began and broke down at the first sentence
three months ago he said he had of express intention mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov purposely used these words instead of intentionally consulted a lawyer in the chief town of the province a distinguished lawyer mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch pavel pavlovitch korneplodov
we will not reproduce his speech word for word but will only summarize the gist of it you have perhaps heard of him
a man of vast intellect the mind of a statesman he knows you too spoke of you in the highest terms
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov broke down again but these breaks did not deter him he leapt instantly over the gaps and struggled on and on
this korneplodov after questioning him minutely and inspecting the documents he was able to bring him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov alluded somewhat vaguely to these documents and slurred over the subject with special haste reported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning the village of tchermashnya which ought he said to have come to him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov from his mother and so checkmate the old villain his father_zossima because every door was not closed and justice might still find a loophole
in fact he might reckon on an additional sum of six or even seven thousand roubles from fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov as tchermashnya was worth at least twenty five thousand he might say twenty eight thousand in fact thirty thirty mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch and would you believe it i didnt get seventeen from that heartless man
so he mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had thrown the business up for the time knowing nothing about the law but on coming here was struck dumb by a cross claim made upon him here mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov went adrift again and again took a flying leap forward so will not you excellent and honored mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch be willing to take up all my claims against that unnatural monster and pay me a sum down of only three thousand
you see you cannot in any case lose over it on my honor my honor i swear that quite the contrary you may make six or seven thousand instead of three
i ll do the business with you at a notary or whatever it is in fact i ready to do anything
whatever you want sign anything and we could draw up the agreement at once and if it were possible if it were only possible that very morning
you could pay me that three thousand for there isnt a capitalist in this town to compare with you and so would save me from
above all he wanted this concluded that very day i ll hand over all the deeds would save me in fact for a good i might say an honorable action
for i cherish the most honorable feeling for a certain person whom you know well and care for as a father_zossima
i would not have come indeed if it had not been as a father_zossima and indeed it a struggle of three in this business for it fate
that a fearful thing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch a tragedy mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch a tragedy and as you ve dropped out long ago it a tug of war between two
i expressing it awkwardly perhaps but i not a literary man you see i on the one side and that monster on the other
so you must choose it either i or the monster it all lies in your hands the fate of three lives and the happiness of two
excuse me i making a mess of it but you understand i see from your venerable eye that you understand
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov broke off his clumsy speech with that so you see and jumping up from his seat awaited the answer to his foolish proposal
at the last phrase he had suddenly become hopelessly aware that it had all fallen flat above all that he had been talking utter nonsense
and if you dont understand i done for so you see how strange it is on the way here it seemed all right and now it nothing but nonsense
all the while he had been talking the old man sat motionless watching him with an icy expression in his eye
after keeping him for a moment in suspense mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch pronounced at last in the most positive and chilling tone excuse me we dont undertake such business
the idea suddenly dawned on his despairing mind mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly felt his legs growing weak under him what am i to do now mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch
he muttered with a pale smile i suppose it all up with me what do you think excuse me
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov remained standing staring motionless he suddenly noticed a movement in the old man face he started you see sir business of that sort not in our line said the old man slowly
there the court and the lawyers it a perfect misery but if you like there is a man here you might apply to
good heavens who is it you re my salvation mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch faltered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he doesnt live here and he not here just now
he is a peasant he does business in timber his name is lyagavy he been haggling with fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov for the last year over your copse at tchermashnya
they cant agree on the price maybe you ve heard now he come back again and is staying with the priest at ilyinskoe about twelve versts from the volovya station
he wrote to me too about the business of the copse asking my advice fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov means to go and see him himself
so if you were to be beforehand with fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and to make lyagavy the offer you ve made me he might possibly a brilliant idea
he haggling with him for it being asked too much and here he would have all the documents entitling him to the property itself
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov interrupted ecstatically he the very man it would just suit him ha ha ha and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly went off into his short wooden laugh startling mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
how can i thank you mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov effusively dont mention it said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov inclining his head
but you dont know you ve saved me oh it was a true presentiment brought me to you so now to this priest
no need of thanks i ll make haste and fly there i afraid i ve overtaxed your strength i shall never forget it
it a russian says that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch a r russian to be sure mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov seized his hand to press it but there was a malignant gleam in the old man eye
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov drew back his hand but at once blamed himself for his mistrustfulness it because he tired he thought
for her sake for her sake mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch you understand that it for her he cried his voice ringing through the room
he bowed turned sharply round and with the same long stride walked to the door without looking back he was trembling with delight
everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel saved me was the thought in his mind and if such a business man as mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov a most worthy old man and what dignity
had suggested this course then then success was assured he would fly off immediately i will be back before night i shall be back at night and the thing is done
he could of course imagine nothing but that the advice was practical from such a business man with an understanding of the business with an understanding of this lyagavy curious surname
could the old man have been laughing at me exclaimed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as he strode towards his lodging or the old man was laughing at him
long afterwards when the catastrophe had happened old mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov himself confessed laughing that he had made a fool of the captain
alas the second alternative was the correct one he was a cold spiteful and sarcastic man liable to violent antipathies
whether it was the captain excited face or the foolish conviction of the rake and spendthrift that he mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov could be taken in by such a cock and bull story as his scheme or his jealousy of grushenka in whose name this scapegrace had rushed in on him with such a tale to get money which worked on the old man i cant tell
but at the instant when mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stood before him feeling his legs grow weak under him and frantically exclaiming that he was ruined at that moment the old man looked at him with intense spite and resolved to make a laughing stock of him
when mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had gone mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch white with rage turned to his son and bade him see to it that that beggar be never seen again and never admitted even into the yard or else he he did not utter his threat
for a whole hour afterwards the old man was shaking with anger and by evening he was worse and sent for the doctor
but even his son who often saw him enraged trembled with fear chapter ii lyagavy so he must drive at full speed and he had not the money for horses
he had forty kopecks and that was all all that was left after so many years of prosperity but he had at home an old silver watch which had long ceased to go
he snatched it up and carried it to a jewish watchmaker who had a shop in the market place the jew gave him six roubles for it
and i didnt expect that cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ecstatically he was still in a state of ecstasy he seized his six roubles and ran home
at home he borrowed three roubles from the people of the house who loved him so much that they were pleased to give it him though it was all they had
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in his excitement told them on the spot that his fate would be decided that day and he described in desperate haste the whole scheme he had put before mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the latter decision his own hopes for the future and so on
these people had been told many of their lodger secrets before and so looked upon him as a gentleman who was not at all proud and almost one of themselves
this was how the fact came to be remembered and established that at midday on the day before the event mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had not a farthing and that he had sold his watch to get money and had borrowed three roubles from his landlord all in the presence of witnesses
having thus collected nine roubles mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sent for posting horses to take him to the volovya station i note this fact later on it will be apparent why i do so
though he was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he would at last solve all his difficulties yet as he drew near volovya station he trembled at the thought of what grushenka might be doing in his absence
this was why he had gone off without telling her and why he left orders with his landlady not to let out where he had gone if any one came to inquire for him
what if she made up her mind to day to go to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov i must i must get back to night he repeated as he was jolted along in the cart and
i dare say i shall have to bring this lyagavy back here to draw up the deed so mused mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with a throbbing heart but alas
to begin with he was late taking a short cut from volovya station which turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve
his dreams were not fated to be carried out secondly he did not find the priest at home at ilyinskoe he had gone off to a neighboring village
the priest a shy and amiable looking little man informed him at once that though lyagavy had been staying with him at first he was now at suhoy possyolok that he was staying the night in the forester cottage as he was buying timber there too
at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov urgent request that he would take him to lyagavy at once and by so doing save him so to speak the priest agreed after some demur to conduct him to suhoy possyolok his curiosity was obviously aroused
while mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov setting off there with the same exhausted horses was looking for him it was almost dark but unluckily he advised their going on foot as it would not be much over a verst
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov of course agreed and marched off with his yard long strides so that the poor priest almost ran after him he was a very cautious man though not old
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at once began talking to him too of his plans nervously and excitedly asking advice in regard to lyagavy and talking all the way
the priest listened attentively but gave little advice he turned off mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov questions with i dont know ah i cant say
when mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began to speak of his quarrel with his father_zossima over his inheritance the priest was positively alarmed as he was in some way dependent on fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
he inquired however with surprise why he called the peasant trader gorstkin lyagavy and obligingly explained to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that though the man name really was lyagavy he was never called so as he would be grievously offended at the name and that he must be sure to call him gorstkin or you ll do nothing with him he wont even listen to you said the priest in conclusion
how can i tell and so on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was somewhat surprised for a moment and explained that that was what mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had called him
on hearing this fact the priest dropped the subject though he would have done well to put into words his doubt whether if mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had sent him to that peasant calling him lyagavy there was not something wrong about it
he hurried striding along and only when he reached suhoy possyolok did he realize that they had come not one verst nor one and a half but at least three
and he was turning him into ridicule but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had no time to pause over such trifles this annoyed him but he controlled himself
they went into the hut the forester lived in one half of the hut and gorstkin was lodging in the other
the better room the other side of the passage they went into that room and lighted a tallow candle the hut was extremely overheated
on the table there was a samovar that had gone out a tray with cups an empty rum bottle a bottle of vodka partly full and some half eaten crusts of wheaten bread
the visitor himself lay stretched at full length on the bench with his coat crushed up under his head for a pillow snoring heavily
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stood in perplexity of course i must wake him my business is too important i ve come in such haste
i in a hurry to get back to day he said in great agitation but the priest and the forester stood in silence not giving their opinion
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov went up and began trying to wake him himself he tried vigorously but the sleeper did not wake he drunk mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov decided
and terribly impatient he began pulling him by the arms by the legs shaking his head lifting him up and making him sit on the bench
yet after prolonged exertions he could only succeed in getting the drunken man to utter absurd grunts and violent but inarticulate oaths
good lord what am i to do what am i to do no you better wait a little the priest pronounced at last for he obviously not in a fit state
he been drinking the whole day the forester chimed in good heavens cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov if only you knew how important it is to me and how desperate i am
and in his despair he was on the point of attacking the sleeping man again but stopped short at once realizing the uselessness of his efforts
no you better wait till morning the priest repeated till morning mercy that impossible the priest said nothing the sleepy forester looked gloomy
what terrible tragedies real life contrives for people said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in complete despair the perspiration was streaming down his face
the priest seized the moment to put before him very reasonably that even if he succeeded in wakening the man he would still be drunk and incapable of conversation
and your business is important he said so you certainly better put it off till morning with a gesture of despair mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov agreed
father_zossima i will stay here with a light and seize the favorable moment as soon as he wakes i ll begin
i ll pay you for the light he said to the forester for the night lodging too you ll remember dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov only father_zossima i dont know what we re to do with you
where will you sleep no i going home i ll take his horse and get home he said indicating the forester
the priest rode off on the forester horse delighted to escape though he shook his head uneasily wondering whether he ought not next day to inform his benefactor fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov of this curious incident or he may in an unlucky hour hear of it be angry and withdraw his favor
the forester scratching himself went back to his room without a word and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sat on the bench to catch the favorable moment as he expressed it
and now i ll say good by i wish you all success so it was settled profound dejection clung about his soul like a heavy mist
a profound intense dejection he sat thinking but could reach no conclusion the candle burnt dimly a cricket chirped it became insufferably close in the overheated room
he suddenly pictured the garden the path behind the garden the door of his father_zossima house mysteriously opening and grushenka running in
he leapt up from the bench it a tragedy he said grinding his teeth mechanically he went up to the sleeping man and looked in his face
he was a lean middle aged peasant with a very long face flaxen curls and a long thin reddish beard wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat from the pocket of which peeped the chain of a silver watch
what was insufferably humiliating was that after leaving things of such importance and making such sacrifices he mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov utterly worn out should with business of such urgency be standing over this dolt on whom his whole fate depended while he snored as though there were nothing the matter as though he dropped from another planet
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looked at his face with intense hatred and for some unknown reason his curly hair particularly irritated him oh the irony of fate cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and quite losing his head he fell again to rousing the tipsy peasant
he roused him with a sort of ferocity pulled at him pushed him even beat him but after five minutes of vain exertions he returned to his bench in helpless despair and sat down
stupid stupid cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and how dishonorable it all is something made him add his head began to ache horribly
should he fling it up and go away altogether he wondered no wait till to morrow now i ll stay on purpose
what else did i come for besides i ve no means of going how am i to get away from here now
oh the idiocy of it but his head ached more and more he sat without moving and unconsciously dozed off and fell asleep as he sat
he seemed to have slept for two hours or more he was waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he could have screamed
there was a hammering in his temples and the top of his head ached it was a long time before he could wake up fully and understand what had happened to him
at last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the stove and that he might die of suffocation
and the drunken peasant still lay snoring the candle guttered and was about to go out mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried out and ran staggering across the passage into the forester room
the forester waked up at once but hearing that the other room was full of fumes to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov surprise and annoyance accepted the fact with strange unconcern though he did go to see to it
but he dead he dead and what am i to do then cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov frantically they threw open the doors opened a window and the chimney
first he wetted his own head then finding a rag of some sort dipped it into the water and put it on lyagavy head
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov brought a pail of water from the passage the forester still treated the matter contemptuously and when he opened the window said grumpily it ll be all right now
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov fussed about the drunken peasant for half an hour wetting his head and gravely resolved not to sleep all night
but he was so worn out that when he sat down for a moment to take breath he closed his eye unconsciously stretched himself full length on the bench and slept like the dead
he went back to sleep leaving mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov a lighted lantern it was dreadfully late when he waked it was somewhere about nine clock
the sun was shining brightly in the two little windows of the hut the curly headed peasant was sitting on the bench and had his coat on
he had another samovar and another bottle in front of him yesterday bottle had already been finished and the new one was more than half empty
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jumped up and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again hopelessly and incurably he stared at him for a moment with wide opened eye
the peasant was silently and slyly watching him with insulting composure and even a sort of contemptuous condescension so mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov fancied
he rushed up to him excuse me you see i you ve most likely heard from the forester here in the hut
i lieutenant dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov the son of the old alyosha_karamazov whose copse you are buying that a lie said the peasant calmly and confidently
a lie you know fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov i dont know any of your fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov pavlovitches said the peasant speaking thickly
you re bargaining with him for the copse for the copse do wake up and collect yourself father_zossima pavel of ilyinskoe brought me here
you wrote to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and he has sent me to you mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov gasped breathlessly you re lying lyagavy blurted out again
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov legs went cold for mercy sake it isnt a joke you re drunk perhaps yet you can speak and understand or else
i understand nothing you re a painter for mercy sake i alyosha_karamazov dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov i have an offer to make you an advantageous offer very advantageous offer concerning the copse
the peasant stroked his beard importantly no you ve contracted for the job and turned out a scamp you re a scoundrel
i assure you you re mistaken cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov wringing his hands in despair the peasant still stroked his beard and suddenly screwed up his eye cunningly
no you show me this you tell me the law that allows roguery you hear you re a scoundrel do you understand that
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stepped back gloomily and suddenly something seemed to hit him on the head as he said afterwards in an instant a light seemed to dawn in his mind a light was kindled and i grasped it all
he stood stupefied wondering how he after all a man of intelligence could have yielded to such folly have been led into such an adventure and have kept it up for almost twenty four hours fussing round this lyagavy wetting his head
why the man drunk dead drunk and he ll go on drinking now for a week what the use of waiting here
and what if mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sent me here on purpose what if she oh god what have i done
the peasant sat watching him and grinning another time mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov might have killed the fool in a fury but now he felt as weak as a child
he went quietly to the bench took up his overcoat put it on without a word and went out of the hut
he took fifty kopecks in small change out of his pocket and put them on the table for his night lodging the candle and the trouble he had given
he did not find the forester in the next room there was no one there coming out of the hut he saw nothing but forest all round
he walked at hazard not knowing which way to turn out of the hut to the right or to the left
hurrying there the evening before with the priest he had not noticed the road he had no revengeful feeling for anybody even for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in his heart
he strode along a narrow forest path aimless dazed without heeding where he was going a child could have knocked him down so weak was he in body and soul
he got out of the forest somehow however and a vista of fields bare after the harvest stretched as far as the eye could see
what despair what death all round he repeated striding on and on he was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven across country in a hired trap
when he overtook him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov asked the way and it turned out that the old merchant too was going to volovya
after some discussion mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov got into the trap three hours later they arrived at volovya mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at once ordered posting horses to drive to the town and suddenly realized that he was appallingly hungry
he ate it all in an instant ate a huge hunk of bread ate a sausage and swallowed three glasses of vodka
while the horses were being harnessed an omelette was prepared for him after eating his spirits and his heart grew lighter
he flew towards the town urged on the driver and suddenly made a new and unalterable plan to procure that accursed money before evening
and to think only to think that a man life should be ruined for the sake of that paltry three thousand
and if it had not been for the thought of grushenka and of what might have happened to her which never left him he would perhaps have become quite cheerful again
he cried contemptuously i ll settle it to day but the thought of her was stabbing him to the heart every moment like a sharp knife
at last they arrived and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at once ran to grushenka chapter iii gold mines this was the visit of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov of which grushenka had spoken to mr_rakitin with such horror
she was just then expecting the message and was much relieved that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had not been to see her that day or the day before
she hoped that please god he wont come till i gone away and he suddenly burst in on her the rest we know already
to get him off her hands she suggested at once that he should walk with her to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov where she said she absolutely must go to settle his accounts and when mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov accompanied her at once she said good by to him at the gate making him promise to come at twelve clock to take her home again
if she was sitting at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov she could not be going to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov if only she not lying he added at once
he was that sort of jealous man who in the absence of the beloved woman at once invents all sort of awful fancy of what may be happening to her and how she may be betraying him but when shaken heartbroken convinced of her faithlessness he runs back to her at the first glance at her face her gay laughing affectionate face he revives at once lays aside all suspicion and with joyful shame abuses himself for his jealousy
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov too was delighted at this arrangement but he thought she was not lying from what he saw after leaving grushenka at the gate he rushed home
oh he had so much still to do that day but a load had been lifted from his heart anyway
now i must only make haste and find out from smerdyakov whether anything happened there last night whether by any chance she went to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov ough floated through his mind
before he had time to reach his lodging jealousy had surged up again in his restless heart jealousy othello was not jealous he was trustful observed pushkin
and that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight of our great poet othello soul was shattered and his whole outlook clouded simply because his ideal was destroyed
but othello did not begin hiding spying peeping he was trustful on the contrary he had to be led up pushed on excited with great difficulty before he could entertain the idea of deceit
it is impossible to picture to oneself the shame and moral degradation to which the jealous man can descend without a qualm of conscience
the truly jealous man is not like that and yet it not as though the jealous were all vulgar and base soul
on the contrary a man of lofty feeling whose love is pure and full of self sacrifice may yet hide under tables bribe the vilest people and be familiar with the lowest ignominy of spying and eavesdropping
othello was incapable of making up his mind to faithlessness not incapable of forgiving it but of making up his mind to it though his soul was as innocent and free from malice as a babe
it is hard to imagine what some jealous man can make up their mind to and overlook and what they can forgive
it is not so with the really jealous man the jealous are the readiest of all to forgive and all women know it
the jealous man can forgive extraordinarily quickly though of course after a violent scene and he is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved the very kisses and embraces he has seen if only he can somehow be convinced that it has all been for the last time and that his rival will vanish from that day forward will depart to the ends of the earth or that he himself will carry her away somewhere where that dreaded rival will not get near her
of course the reconciliation is only for an hour for even if the rival did disappear next day he would invent another one and would be jealous of him
and one might wonder what there was in a love that had to be so watched over what a love could be worth that needed such strenuous guarding
it is remarkable too that those very man of noble hearts standing hidden in some cupboard listening and spying never feel the stings of conscience at that moment anyway though they understand clearly enough with their noble hearts the shameful depths to which they have voluntarily sunk
at the sight of grushenka mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jealousy vanished and for an instant he became trustful and generous and positively despised himself for his evil feeling
but it only proved that in his love for the woman there was an element of something far higher than he himself imagined that it was not only a sensual passion not only the curve of her body of which he had talked to alyosha_karamazov
but as soon as grushenka had gone mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began to suspect her of all the low cunning of faithlessness and he felt no sting of conscience at it
but that the jealous will never understand and yet among them are man of noble hearts and so jealousy surged up in him again
he had in any case to make haste the first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small temporary loan of money
the nine roubles had almost all gone on his expedition and as we all know one cant take a step without money
he had a brace of fine dueling pistol in a case which he had not pawned till then because he prized them above all his possessions
in the metropolis tavern he had some time since made acquaintance with a young official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor was passionately fond of weapons
but he had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan he used to buy pistol revolvers daggers hang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances
he prided himself on them and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of the revolver mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov without stopping to think went straight to him and offered to pawn his pistol to him for ten roubles
but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov would not consent so the young man gave him ten roubles protesting that nothing would induce him to take interest
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was in haste he rushed towards fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov by the back way to his arbor to get hold of smerdyakov as soon as possible
in this way the fact was established that three or four hours before a certain event of which i shall speak later on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had not a farthing and pawned for ten roubles a possession he valued though three hours later he was in possession of thousands
the official delighted began trying to persuade him to sell them outright they parted friends but i am anticipating from marya_kondratyevna the woman living near fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov he learned the very disturbing fact of smerdyakov illness
he heard the story of his fall in the cellar his fit the doctor visit fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov anxiety he heard with interest too that his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had set off that morning for moscow
then he must have driven through volovya before me thought dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov but he was terribly distressed about smerdyakov what will happen now
who ll keep watch for me who ll bring me word he thought he began greedily questioning the women whether they had seen anything the evening before
they quite understood what he was trying to find out and completely reassured him no one had been there ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had been there the night everything had been perfectly as usual
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov grew thoughtful he would certainly have to keep watch to day but where here or at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov gate he decided that he must be on the look out both here and there and meanwhile meanwhile
the difficulty was that he had to carry out the new plan that he had made on the journey back he was sure of its success but he must not delay acting upon it
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov resolved to sacrifice an hour to it in an hour i shall know everything i shall settle everything and then then first of all to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
i ll inquire whether grushenka there and instantly be back here again stay till eleven and then to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov again to bring her home
this was what he decided he flew home washed combed his hair brushed his clothes dressed and went to madame_hohlakov
alas he had built his hopes on her he had resolved to borrow three thousand from that lady and what was more he felt suddenly convinced that she would not refuse to lend it to him
it may be wondered why if he felt so certain he had not gone to her at first one of his own sort so to speak instead of to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov a man he did not know who was not of his own class and to whom he hardly knew how to speak
but the fact was that he had never known madame_hohlakov well and had seen nothing of her for the last month and that he knew she could not endure him
she had detested him from the first because he was engaged to katerina_ivanovna while she had for some reason suddenly conceived the desire that katerina_ivanovna should throw him over and marry the charming chivalrously refined ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov who had such excellent manners
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov positively laughed at her and had once said about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was uncultivated
but that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck him if she is so anxious i should not marry katerina_ivanovna and he knew she was positively hysterical upon the subject why should she refuse me now that three thousand just to enable me to leave katya and get away from her for ever
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov manners she detested these spoilt fine lady if they set their hearts on anything will spare no expense to satisfy their caprice
as for his plan it was just the same as before it consisted of the offer of his rights to tchermashnya but not with a commercial object as it had been with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov not trying to allure the lady with the possibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand but simply as a security for the debt
as he worked out this new idea mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was enchanted with it but so it always was with him in all his undertakings in all his sudden decisions
besides she so rich mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov argued he gave himself up to every new idea with passionate enthusiasm yet when he mounted the steps of madame_hohlakov house he felt a shiver of fear run down his spine
at that moment he saw fully as a mathematical certainty that this was his last hope that if this broke down nothing else was left him in the world but to rob and murder some one for the three thousand
it was half past seven when he rang at the bell at first fortune seemed to smile upon him as soon as he was announced he was received with extraordinary rapidity
as though she were waiting for me thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and as soon as he had been led to the drawing room the lady of the house herself ran in and declared at once that she was expecting him
i was expecting you i was expecting you though i no reason to suppose you would come to see me as you will admit yourself
yet i did expect you you may marvel at my instinct dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but i was convinced all the morning that you would come
that is certainly wonderful madam observed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sitting down limply but i have come to you on a matter of great importance
i know you ve come on most important business dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov it not a case of presentiment no reactionary harking back to the miraculous have you heard about father_zossima
this is a case of mathematics you couldnt help coming after all that has passed with katerina_ivanovna you couldnt you couldnt that a mathematical certainty
on a matter of supreme importance for me that is madam for me alone and i hasten
the realism of actual life madam that what it is but allow me to explain realism indeed dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i all for realism now
i ve seen too much of miracles you ve heard that father_zossima is dead no madam it the first time i ve heard of it
last night and only imagine madam said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i can imagine nothing except that i in a desperate position and that if you dont help me everything will come to grief and i first of all
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was a little surprised the image of alyosha_karamazov rose to his mind excuse me for the triviality of the expression but i in a fever
i know i know that you re in a fever you could hardly fail to be and whatever you may say to me i know beforehand
i have long been thinking over your destiny dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i am watching over it and studying it oh believe me i an experienced doctor of the soul dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
madam if you are an experienced doctor i certainly an experienced patient said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with an effort to be polite and i feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way you will come to my help in my ruin and so allow me at least to explain to you the plan with which i have ventured to come to you and what i am hoping of you
i have come madam dont explain it it of secondary importance but as for help you re not the first i have helped dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
you have most likely heard of my cousin madame belmesov her husband was ruined had come to grief as you characteristically express it dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
i recommended him to take to horse breeding and now he doing well have you any idea of horse breeding dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov not the faintest madam ah madam not the faintest cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in nervous impatience positively starting from his seat
only give me two minutes of free speech that i may just explain to you everything the whole plan with which i have come
i in a fearful hurry mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried hysterically feeling that she was just going to begin talking again and hoping to cut her short
i have come in despair in the last gasp of despair to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand a loan but on safe most safe security madam with the most trustworthy guarantees
i simply implore you madam to listen to me besides i am short of time only let me explain you must tell me all that afterwards afterwards
madame_hohlakov with a gesture demanded silence in her turn and whatever you may tell me i know it all beforehand i ve told you so already
you ask for a certain sum for three thousand but i can give you more immeasurably more i will save you dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but you must listen to me
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov started from his seat again madam will you really be so good he cried with strong feeling
good god you ve saved me you have saved a man from a violent death from a bullet my eternal gratitude
i will give you more infinitely more than three thousand cried madame_hohlakov looking with a radiant smile at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ecstasy
i only need that fatal three thousand and on my part i can give security for that sum with infinite gratitude and i propose a plan which
madame_hohlakov cut him short with the modest triumph of beneficence i have promised to save you and i will save you
infinitely but i dont need so much enough dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov it said and done i will save you as i did belmesov
what do you think of the gold mines dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov of the gold mines madam i have never thought anything about them
but i have thought of them for you thought of them over and over again i have been watching you for the last month
i ve watched you a hundred time as you ve walked past saying to myself that a man of energy who ought to be at the gold mines
i ve studied your gait and come to the conclusion that a man who would find gold from my gait madam said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov smiling
yes from your gait you surely dont deny that character can be told from the gait dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov science supports the idea
i all for science and realism now after all this business with father_zossima which has so upset me from this very day i a realist
and i want to devote myself to practical usefulness i cured enough as turgenev says but madam the three thousand you so generously promised to lend me
the money is as good as in your pocket not three thousand but three million dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in less than no time
i ll make you a present of the idea you shall find gold mines make millions return and become a leading man and wake us up and lead us to better things
it is yours dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov madame_hohlakov cut in at once are we to leave it all to the jews
you will found institutions and enterprises of all sort you will help the poor and they will bless you this is the age of railways dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
the depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov people dont know that side of me madam madam
you ll become famous and indispensable to the department of finance which is so badly off at present dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov interrupted with an uneasy presentiment
i shall indeed perhaps follow your advice your wise advice madam i shall perhaps set off to the gold mines
i ll come and see you again about it many time indeed but now that three thousand you so generously
oh that would set me free and if you could to day you see i havent a minute a minute to lose to day
enough dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov enough madame_hohlakov interrupted emphatically the question is will you go to the gold mines or not have you quite made up your mind
answer yes or no i will go madam afterwards i ll go where you like but now wait cried madame_hohlakov
and jumping up and running to a handsome bureau with numerous little drawers she began pulling out one drawer after another looking for something with desperate haste
the three thousand thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov his heart almost stopping and at the instant without any papers or formalities that doing things in gentlemanly style
she a splendid woman if only she didnt talk so much here cried madame_hohlakov running back joyfully to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov here is what i was looking for
it was a tiny silver ikon on a cord such as is sometimes worn next the skin with a cross
let me put it on your neck myself and with it dedicate you to a new life to a new career
this is from kiev dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov she went on reverently from the relics of the holy martyr varvara and she actually put the cord round his neck and began arranging it
in extreme embarrassment mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov bent down and helped her and at last he got it under his neck tie and collar through his shirt to his chest
now you can set off madame_hohlakov pronounced sitting down triumphantly in her place again madam i am so touched
i dont know how to thank you indeed for such kindness but if only you knew how precious time is to me
oh madam since you are so kind so touchingly generous to me mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov exclaimed impulsively then let me reveal to you though of course you ve known it a long time
that sum of money for which i shall be indebted to your generosity that i love somebody here i have been false to katya
oh i ve behaved inhumanly dishonorably to her but i fell in love here with another woman a woman whom you madam perhaps despise for you know everything already but whom i cannot leave on any account and therefore that three thousand now
katerina_ivanovna i should say leave everything dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov madame_hohlakov interrupted in the most decisive tone leave everything especially women
gold mines are your goal and there no place for women there afterwards when you come back rich and famous you will find the girl of your heart in the highest society
that will be a modern girl a girl of education and advanced ideas by that time the dawning woman question will have gained ground and the new woman will have appeared
yes it is dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov just what you need the very thing you re yearning for though you dont realize it yourself
madam that not the point not at all mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov clasped his hands in entreaty i am not at all opposed to the present woman movement dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
the development of woman and even the political emancipation of woman in the near future that my ideal i ve a daughter myself dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov people dont know that side of me
i wrote a letter to the author shtchedrin on that subject he has taught me so much so much about the vocation of woman
so last year i sent him an anonymous letter of two lines i kiss and embrace you my teacher for the modern woman
persevere and i signed myself a mother i thought of signing myself a contemporary mother and hesitated but i stuck to the simple mother
there more moral beauty in that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and the word contemporary might have reminded him of the contemporary a painful recollection owing to the censorship
good heavens what is the matter madam cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jumping up at last clasping his hands before her in helpless entreaty
you will make me weep if you delay what you have so generously oh do weep dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov do weep
that a noble feeling such a path lies open before you tears will ease your heart and later on you will return rejoicing
you will hasten to me from siberia on purpose to share your joy with me but allow me too mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried suddenly
for the last time i entreat you tell me can i have the sum you promised me to day if not when may i come for it
what sum dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov the three thousand you promised me that you so generously three thousand roubles oh no i havent got three thousand madame_hohlakov announced with serene amazement
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was stupefied why you said just now you said you said it was as good as in my hands
oh no you misunderstood me dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in that case you misunderstood me i was talking of the gold mines
i promised you more infinitely more than three thousand i remember it all now but i was referring to the gold mines
it true but the money the three thousand mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov exclaimed awkwardly oh if you meant money i havent any
i havent a penny dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i quarreling with my steward about it and i ve just borrowed five hundred roubles from pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov myself
no no i ve no money and do you know dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov if i had i wouldnt give it to you in the first place i never lend money
i wouldnt give it you because i like you and want to save you for all you need is the gold mines the gold mines the gold mines
lending money means losing friends and i wouldnt give it to you particularly oh the devil roared mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and with all his might brought his fist down on the table
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov spat on the ground and strode rapidly out of the room out of the house into the street into the darkness
he walked like one possessed and beating himself on the breast on the spot where he had struck himself two day previously before alyosha_karamazov the last time he saw him in the dark on the road
what those blows upon his breast signified on that spot and what he meant by it that was for the time a secret which was known to no one in the world and had not been told even to alyosha_karamazov
aie aie cried madame_hohlakov alarmed and she flew to the other end of the drawing room but that secret meant for him more than disgrace it meant ruin suicide
so he had determined if he did not get hold of the three thousand that would pay his debt to katerina_ivanovna and so remove from his breast from that spot on his breast the shame he carried upon it that weighed on his conscience
all this will be fully explained to the reader later on but now that his last hope had vanished this man so strong in appearance burst out crying like a little child a few steps from the hohlakovs house
he walked on and not knowing what he was doing wiped away his tears with his fist in this way he reached the square and suddenly became aware that he had stumbled against something
he heard a piercing wail from an old woman whom he had almost knocked down good lord you ve nearly killed me
why dont you look where you re going scapegrace why it you cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov recognizing the old woman in the dark
it was the old servant who waited on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov whom mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had particularly noticed the day before and who are you my good sir
said the old woman in quite a different voice i dont know you in the dark you live at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch
you re the servant there just so sir i was only running out to prohoritch but i dont know you now
tell me my good woman is agrafena_alexandrovna there now said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov beside himself with suspense i saw her to the house some time ago
she has been there sir she stayed a little while and went off again what went away cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
when did she go why as soon as she came she only stayed a minute she only told mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kuzmitch a tale that made him laugh and then she ran away
you re lying damn you roared mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov aie aie shrieked the old woman but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had vanished he ran with all his might to the house where grushenka lived
at the moment he reached it grushenka was on her way to mokroe it was not more than a quarter of an hour after her departure
fenya was sitting with her grandmother the old cook matryona in the kitchen when the captain ran in fenya uttered a piercing shriek on seeing him
you scream roared mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov where is she but without giving the terror stricken fenya time to utter a word he fell all of a heap at her feet
fenya for church_of_christ sake tell me where is she i dont know dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov my dear i dont know
you may kill me but i cant tell you fenya swore and protested you went out with her yourself not long ago
she came back indeed she didnt by god i swear she didnt come back you re lying shouted mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
from your terror i know where she is he rushed away fenya in her fright was glad she had got off so easily
but she knew very well that it was only that he was in such haste or she might not have fared so well
on the table stood a brass mortar with a pestle in it a small brass pestle not much more than six inches long
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov already had opened the door with one hand when with the other he snatched up the pestle and thrust it in his side pocket
but as he ran he surprised both fenya and old matryona by an unexpected action oh lord he going to murder some one
cried fenya flinging up her hands chapter iv in the dark where was he running where could she be except at fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
she must have run straight to him from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that was clear now the whole intrigue the whole deceit was evident
it all rushed whirling through his mind he did not run to marya_kondratyevna there was no need to go there not the slightest need
he must raise no alarm they would run and tell directly marya_kondratyevna was clearly in the plot smerdyakov too he too all had been bought over
he formed another plan of action he ran a long way round fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov house crossing the lane running down dmitrovsky street then over the little bridge and so came straight to the deserted alley at the back which was empty and uninhabited with on one side the hurdle fence of a neighbor kitchen garden on the other the strong high fence
here he chose a spot apparently the very place where according to the tradition he knew lizaveta had once climbed over it if she could climb over it the thought god knows why occurred to him surely i can
that ran all round fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov garden he did in fact jump up and instantly contrived to catch hold of the top of the fence
close by in the garden stood the bath house but from the fence he could see the lighted windows of the house too
then he vigorously pulled himself up and sat astride on it yes the old man bedroom is lighted up she there
though he knew grigory_vassilyevitch was ill and very likely smerdyakov too and that there was no one to hear him he instinctively hid himself stood still and began to listen
but there was dead silence on all sides and as though of design complete stillness not the slightest breath of wind
and he leapt from the fence into the garden and naught but the whispering silence the line for some reason rose to his mind
if only no one heard me jump over the fence i think not standing still for a minute he walked softly over the grass in the garden avoiding the trees and shrubs
he walked slowly creeping stealthily at every step listening to his own footsteps it took him five minutes to reach the lighted window
the door from the house into the garden on the left hand side was shut he had carefully looked on purpose to see in passing
he remembered that just under the window there were several thick and high bushes of elder and whitebeam at last he reached the bushes and hid behind them
i must wait now he thought to reassure them in case they heard my footsteps and are listening if only i dont cough or sneeze
he held his breath he waited two minutes his heart was beating violently and at moments he could scarcely breathe
no this throbbing at my heart wont stop he thought i cant wait any longer he was standing behind a bush in the shadow
the light of the window fell on the front part of the bush how red the whitebeam berries are he murmured not knowing why
softly and noiselessly step by step he approached the window and raised himself on tiptoe all fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov bedroom lay open before him
it was not a large room and was divided in two parts by a red screen chinese as fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov used to call it
he began watching fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov who was wearing his new striped silk dressing gown which mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had never seen and a silk cord with tassels round the waist
the word chinese flashed into mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mind and behind the screen is grushenka thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov a clean dandified shirt of fine linen with gold studs peeped out under the collar of the dressing gown
on his head fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had the same red bandage which alyosha_karamazov had seen he has got himself up thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
suddenly he jerked up his head listened a moment and hearing nothing went up to the table poured out half a glass of brandy from a decanter and drank it off
then he uttered a deep sigh again stood still a moment walked carelessly up to the looking glass on the wall with his right hand raised the red bandage on his forehead a little and began examining his bruises and scars which had not yet disappeared
his father_zossima was standing near the window apparently lost in thought he alone thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in all probability he alone
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov moved away from the looking glass turned suddenly to the window and looked out mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov instantly slipped away into the shadow
she may be there behind the screen perhaps she asleep by now he thought with a pang at his heart
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov moved away from the window he looking for her out of the window so she not there why should he stare out into the dark
he wild with impatience mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov slipped back at once and fell to gazing in at the window again the old man was sitting down at the table apparently disappointed
at last he put his elbow on the table and laid his right cheek against his hand mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov watched him eagerly
he alone he alone he repeated again if she were here his face would be different strange to say a queer irrational vexation rose up in his heart that she was not here
it not that she not here he explained to himself immediately but that i cant tell for certain whether she is or not
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov remembered afterwards that his mind was at that moment exceptionally clear that he took in everything to the slightest detail and missed no point
but a feeling of misery the misery of uncertainty and indecision was growing in his heart with every instant
the angry doubt filled his heart and suddenly making up his mind he put out his hand and softly knocked on the window frame
he knocked the signal the old man had agreed upon with smerdyakov twice slowly and then three time more quickly the signal that meant grushenka is here
is she here or not the old man started jerked up his head and jumping up quickly ran to the window
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov slipped away into the shadow fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov opened the window and thrust his whole head out grushenka is it you
is it you he said in a sort of trembling half whisper where are you my angel where are you
cried the old man again and he thrust his head out farther thrust it out to the shoulders gazing in all directions right and left
he was fearfully agitated and breathless he alone mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov decided where are you come here i ve a little present for you
come i ll show you he means the three thousand thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov but where are you are you at the door
and the old man almost climbed out of the window peering out to the right where there was a door into the garden trying to see into the darkness
i ll open it directly in another second he would certainly have run out to open the door without waiting for grushenka answer
the old man profile that he loathed so his pendent adam apple his hooked nose his lips that smiled in greedy expectation were all brightly lighted up by the slanting lamplight falling on the left from the room
a horrible fury of hatred suddenly surged up in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov heart there he was his rival the man who had tormented him had ruined his life
it was a rush of that sudden furious revengeful anger of which he had spoken as though foreseeing it to alyosha_karamazov four day ago in the arbor when in answer to alyosha_karamazov question how can you say you ll kill our father_zossima
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looked at him from the side without stirring i dont know i dont know he had said then
perhaps i shall not kill him perhaps i shall i afraid he ll suddenly be so loathsome to me at that moment
i hate his double chin his nose his eye his shameless grin i feel a personal repulsion that what i afraid of that what may be too much for me
this personal repulsion was growing unendurable mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was beside himself he suddenly pulled the brass pestle out of his pocket
god was watching over me then mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov himself said afterwards at that very moment grigory_vassilyevitch waked up on his bed of sickness
he had rubbed himself all over with vodka mixed with a secret very strong decoction had drunk what was left of the mixture while his wife repeated a certain prayer over him after which he had gone to bed
earlier in the evening he had undergone the treatment which smerdyakov had described to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov marfa_ignatyevna had tasted the stuff too and being unused to strong drink slept like the dead beside her husband
but grigory_vassilyevitch waked up in the night quite suddenly and after a moment reflection though he immediately felt a sharp pain in his back he sat up in bed
then he deliberated again got up and dressed hurriedly perhaps his conscience was uneasy at the thought of sleeping while the house was unguarded in such perilous time
the stuff been too much for the woman grigory_vassilyevitch thought glancing at her and groaning he went out on the steps
no doubt he only intended to look out from the steps for he was hardly able to walk the pain in his back and his right leg was intolerable
smerdyakov exhausted by his fit lay motionless in the next room marfa_ignatyevna did not stir but he suddenly remembered that he had not locked the little gate into the garden that evening
he was the most punctual and precise of man a man who adhered to an unchangeable routine and habits that lasted for years
limping and writhing with pain he went down the steps and towards the garden yes the gate stood wide open mechanically he stepped into the garden
perhaps he fancied something perhaps caught some sound and glancing to the left he saw his master window open no one was looking out of it then
it not summer now thought grigory_vassilyevitch and suddenly at that very instant he caught a glimpse of something extraordinary before him in the garden
forty paces in front of him a man seemed to be running in the dark a sort of shadow was moving very fast
what it open for good lord cried grigory_vassilyevitch beside himself and forgetting the pain in his back he hurried to intercept the running figure
he took a short cut evidently he knew the garden better the flying figure went towards the bath house ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence
grigory_vassilyevitch followed not losing sight of him and ran forgetting everything he reached the fence at the very moment the man was climbing over it
grigory_vassilyevitch cried out beside himself pounced on him and clutched his leg in his two hands yes his foreboding had not deceived him
the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood could hear but he had not time to shout more he fell at once as though struck by lightning
he recognized him it was he the monster the parricide parricide mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man
in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hands was a brass pestle and he flung it mechanically in the grass the pestle fell two paces from grigory_vassilyevitch not in the grass but on the path in a most conspicuous place
for some second he examined the prostrate figure before him the old man head was covered with blood mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov put out his hand and began feeling it
he remembered afterwards clearly that he had been awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken the old man skull or simply stunned him with the pestle
he remembered taking out of his pocket the clean white handkerchief with which he had provided himself for his visit to madame_hohlakov and putting it to the old man head senselessly trying to wipe the blood from his face and temples
but the blood was flowing horribly and in a moment mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov fingers were drenched with the hot stream but the handkerchief was instantly soaked with blood
good heavens what am i doing it for thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly pulling himself together if i have broken his skull how can i find out now
and what difference does it make now he added hopelessly if i ve killed him i ve killed him you ve come to grief old man so there you must lie
and suddenly turning to the fence he vaulted over it into the lane and fell to running the handkerchief soaked with blood he held crushed up in his right fist and as he ran he thrust it into the back pocket of his coat
he ran headlong and the few passers by who met him in the dark in the streets remembered afterwards that they had met a man running that night
immediately after he had left it that evening fenya had rushed to the chief porter nazar ivanovitch and besought him for church_of_christ sake not to let the captain in again to day or to morrow
nazar ivanovitch promised but went upstairs to his mistress who had suddenly sent for him and meeting his nephew a boy of twenty who had recently come from the country on the way up told him to take his place but forgot to mention the captain
he said aloud he flew back again to the widow morozov house mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov running up to the gate knocked
opening the gate at once he let him in and hastened to inform him with a good humored smile that agrafena_alexandrovna is not at home now you know
the lad instantly recognized him for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had more than once tipped him where is she then prohor asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stopping short
she set off this evening some two hours ago with timofey to mokroe what for cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that i cant say
to see some officer some one invited her and horses were sent to fetch her mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov left him and ran like a madman to fenya
chapter a sudden resolution she was sitting in the kitchen with her grandmother they were both just going to bed
relying on nazar ivanovitch they had not locked themselves in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ran in pounced on fenya and seized her by the throat
speak at once where is she with whom is she now at mokroe he roared furiously both the women squealed
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov darling i ll tell you everything directly i wont hide anything gabbled fenya frightened to death she gone to mokroe to her officer
to her officer the same one she used to know the one who threw her over five years ago cackled fenya as fast as she could speak
aie i ll tell you aie what officer roared mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mitya withdrew the hands with which he was squeezing her throat
he stood facing her pale as death unable to utter a word but his eye showed that he realized it all all from the first word and guessed the whole position
she remained sitting on the trunk as she had been when he ran into the room trembling all over holding her hands out before her as though trying to defend herself
poor fenya was not in a condition at that moment to observe whether he understood or not she seemed to have grown rigid in that position
her wide opened scared eye were fixed immovably upon him and to make matters worse both his hands were smeared with blood
on the way as he ran he must have touched his forehead with them wiping off the perspiration so that on his forehead and his right cheek were blood stained patches
fenya was on the verge of hysterics the old cook had jumped up and was staring at him like a mad woman almost unconscious with terror
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stood for a moment then mechanically sank on to a chair next to fenya he sat not reflecting but as it were terror stricken benumbed
yet everything was clear as day that officer he knew about him he knew everything perfectly he had known it from grushenka herself had known that a letter had come from him a month before
so that for a month for a whole month this had been going on a secret from him till the very arrival of this new man and he had never thought of him
but how could he how could he not have thought of him why was it he had forgotten this officer like that forgotten him as soon as he heard of him
that was the question that faced him like some monstrous thing and he looked at this monstrous thing with horror growing cold with horror
but suddenly as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate child he began speaking to fenya as though he had utterly forgotten how he had scared and hurt her just now
he fell to questioning fenya with an extreme preciseness astonishing in his position and though the girl looked wildly at his blood stained hands she too with wonderful readiness and rapidity answered every question as though eager to put the whole truth and nothing but the truth before him
little by little even with a sort of enjoyment she began explaining every detail not wanting to torment him but as it were eager to be of the utmost service to him
she described the whole of that day in great detail the visit of mr_rakitin and alyosha_karamazov how she fenya had stood on the watch how the mistress had set off and how she had called out of the window to alyosha_karamazov to give him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov her greetings and to tell him to remember for ever how she had loved him for an hour
hearing of the message mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly smiled and there was a flush of color on his pale cheeks at the same moment fenya said to him not a bit afraid now to be inquisitive
look at your hands dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov they re all over blood yes answered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mechanically he looked carelessly at his hands and at once forgot them and fenya question
he sank into silence again twenty minutes had passed since he had run in his first horror was over but evidently some new fixed determination had taken possession of him
he suddenly stood up smiling dreamily what has happened to you sir said fenya pointing to his hands again she spoke compassionately as though she felt very near to him now in his grief
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looked at his hands again that blood fenya he said looking at her with a strange expression that human blood and my god
why was it shed but fenya there a fence here he looked at her as though setting her a riddle a high fence and terrible to look at
but at dawn to morrow when the sun rises mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov will leap over that fence you dont understand what fence fenya and never mind
you ll hear to morrow and understand and now good by i wont stand in her way i ll step aside i know how to step aside
live my joy you loved me for an hour remember mityenka alyosha_karamazov so for ever she always used to call me mityenka do you remember
and with those words he went suddenly out of the kitchen fenya was almost more frightened at this sudden departure than she had been when he ran in and attacked her
just ten minutes later dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov went in to pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin the young official with whom he had pawned his pistol
it was by now half past eight and pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin had finished his evening tea and had just put his coat on again to go to the metropolis to play billiards
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov caught him coming out seeing him with his face all smeared with blood the young man uttered a cry of surprise
good heavens what is the matter i ve come for my pistol said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and brought you the money and thanks very much
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin grew more and more surprised he suddenly caught sight of a bundle of bank notes in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hand and what was more he had walked in holding the notes as no one walks in and no one carries money he had them in his right hand and held them outstretched as if to show them
pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin servant boy who met mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in the passage said afterwards that he walked into the passage in the same way with the money outstretched in his hand so he must have been carrying them like that even in the streets
i in a hurry pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin please make haste they were all rainbow colored hundred rouble notes and the fingers holding them were covered with blood
when pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin was questioned later on as to the sum of money he said that it was difficult to judge at a glance but that it might have been two thousand or perhaps three but it was a big fat bundle
so he testified afterwards seemed unlike himself too not drunk but as it were exalted lost to everything but at the same time as it were absorbed as though pondering and searching for something and unable to come to a decision
he was in great haste answered abruptly and very strangely and at moments seemed not at all dejected but quite cheerful
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but what is the matter with you what wrong cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin looking wildly at his guest
how is it that you re all covered with blood have you had a fall look at yourself he took him by the elbow and led him to the glass
that the last straw he muttered angrily hurriedly changing the notes from his right hand to the left and impulsively jerked the handkerchief out of his pocket
but the handkerchief turned out to be soaked with blood too it was the handkerchief he had used to wipe grigory_vassilyevitch face
there was scarcely a white spot on it and it had not merely begun to dry but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and could not be pulled apart
seeing his blood stained face mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov started and scowled wrathfully damnation mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov threw it angrily on the floor oh damn it
he said havent you a rag of some sort to wipe my face so you re only stained not wounded
you better wash said pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin here a wash stand i ll pour you out some water a wash stand that all right
with the strangest perplexity he indicated his bundle of hundred rouble notes looking inquiringly at pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin as though it were for him to decide what he mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was to do with his own money
but where am i to put this in your pocket or on the table here they wont be lost
in my pocket yes in my pocket all right but i say that all nonsense he cried as though suddenly coming out of his absorption
here your money because i am in great need of them and i havent a minute a minute to spare
look here let first settle that business of the pistol give them back to me and taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin
no said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looking again at the bundle and as though not trusting his own words he turned over two or three of the topmost ones
but i shant have change enough havent you less no they re all alike he added and again he looked inquiringly at pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin
how have you grown so rich the latter asked wait i ll send my boy to plotnikov they close late to see if they wont change it
here misha he called into the passage to plotnikov shop first rate cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as though struck by an idea
misha he turned to the boy as he came in look here run to plotnikov and tell them that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov sends his greetings and will be there directly
but listen listen tell them to have champagne three dozen bottles ready before i come and packed as it was to take to mokroe
i took four dozen with me then he added suddenly addressing pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin they know all about it dont you trouble misha he turned again to the boy
stay listen tell them to put in cheese strasburg pies smoked fish ham caviare and everything everything they ve got up to a hundred roubles or a hundred and twenty as before
one melon enough and chocolate candy toffee fondants in fact everything i took to mokroe before three hundred roubles worth with the champagne let it be just the same again
but wait dont let them forget dessert sweets pears water melons two or three or four no and remember misha if you are called misha his name is misha isnt it
he turned to pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin again wait a minute protr pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin intervened listening and watching him uneasily you better go yourself and tell them
he ll muddle it he will i see he will eh misha why i was going to kiss you for the commission
if you dont make a mistake there ten roubles for you run along make haste champagne the chief thing let them bring up champagne
and brandy too and red and white wine and all i had then they know what i had then but listen
i say let him simply run and change the money and tell them not to close and you go and tell them
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin seemed to hurry misha off on purpose because the boy remained standing with his mouth and eye wide open apparently understanding little of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov orders gazing up with amazement and terror at his blood stained face and the trembling bloodstained fingers that held the notes
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin interrupted with some impatience give him your note be off misha put your best leg forward well now come and wash said pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin sternly
put the money on the table or else in your pocket that right come along but take off your coat
and beginning to help him off with his coat he cried out again look your coat covered with blood too
that it not the coat it only a little here on the sleeve and that only here where the handkerchief lay
i must have sat on the handkerchief at fenya and the blood come through mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov explained at once with a childlike unconsciousness that was astounding
it must have soaked through pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin listened frowning well you must have been up to something you must have been fighting with some one he muttered
they began to wash pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin held the jug and poured out the water mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in desperate haste scarcely soaped his hands they were trembling and pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin remembered it afterwards
but the young official insisted on his soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more he seemed to exercise more and more sway over mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as time went on
it may be noted in passing that he was a young man of sturdy character look you havent got your nails clean
now rub your face here on your temples by your ear will you go in that shirt where are you going
look all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood yes it all bloody observed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looking at the cuff of his shirt
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov went on with the same confiding ingenuousness drying his face and hands on the towel and putting on his coat
then change your shirt i havent time you see i ll i ll turn it up at the wrist
it wont be seen under the coat you see tell me now what game have you been up to have you been fighting with some one
in the tavern again as before have you been beating that captain again pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin asked him reproachfully whom have you been beating now or killing perhaps
nonsense said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov why nonsense dont worry said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and he suddenly laughed i smashed an old woman in the market place just now
an old man cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looking pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin straight in the face laughing and shouting at him as though he were deaf
smashed an old woman confound it an old woman an old man have you killed some one we made it up
we had a row and made it up in a place i know of we parted friends a fool he forgiven me
if he had got up he wouldnt have forgiven me mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly winked only damn him you know i say pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin damn him
he sure to have forgiven me by now dont worry about him i dont want to just now mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov snapped out resolutely
whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with every one for just as you did with that captain over some nonsense
you ve been fighting and now you re rushing off on the spree that you all over three dozen champagne what do you want all that for
bravo now give me the pistol upon my honor i ve no time now i should like to have a chat with you my dear boy but i havent the time
and there no need it too late for talking where my money where have i put it he cried thrusting his hands into his pockets
you put it on the table yourself here it is had you forgotten money like dirt or water to you it seems
here are your pistol it an odd thing at six clock you pledged them for ten roubles and now you ve got thousands
two or three i should say three you bet laughed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stuffing the notes into the side pocket of his trousers
you ll lose it like that have you found a gold mine the mines the gold mines mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov shouted at the top of his voice and went off into a roar of laughter
would you like to go to the mines pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin there a lady here who ll stump up three thousand for you if only you ll go
she did it for me she so awfully fond of gold mines do you know madame_hohlakov i dont know her but i ve heard of her and seen her
as soon as the sun rises to morrow as soon as phoebus ever young flies upwards praising and glorifying god you go to her this madame_hohlakov and ask her whether she did stump up that three thousand or not
did she really give you three thousand did she really said pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin eyeing him dubiously try and find out
i dont know on what terms you are since you say it so positively i suppose she did give it to you
you ve got the money in your hand but instead of going to siberia you re spending it all where are you really off to now eh
to mokroe to mokroe but it night once the lad had all now the lad has naught cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly
how naught you say that with all those thousands i not talking about thousands damn thousands i talking of the female character
fickle is the heart of woman treacherous and full of vice i agree with ulysses that what he says i dont understand you
am i drunk not drunk but worse i drunk in spirit pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin drunk in spirit but that enough
what are you doing loading the pistol i loading the pistol unfastening the pistol case mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov actually opened the powder horn and carefully sprinkled and rammed in the charge
then he took the bullet and before inserting it held it in two fingers in front of the candle why are you looking at the bullet asked pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin watching him with uneasy curiosity
oh a fancy why if you meant to put that bullet in your brain would you look at it or not
why look at it it going into my brain so it interesting to look and see what it like but that foolishness a moment foolishness
now that done he added putting in the bullet and driving it home with the ramrod pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin my dear fellow
that nonsense all nonsense and if only you knew what nonsense give me a little piece of paper now
and taking a pen from the table mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov rapidly wrote two lines folded the paper in four and thrust it in his waistcoat pocket
here some paper no a clean new piece writing paper that right he put the pistol in the case locked it up and kept it in his hand
then he looked at pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin with a slow thoughtful smile now let go where are we going no wait a minute
are you thinking of putting that bullet in your brain perhaps pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin asked uneasily i was fooling about the bullet
i want to live i love life you may be sure of that i love golden haired phoebus and his warm light
dear pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin do you know how to step aside what do you mean by stepping aside making way
making way for a dear creature and for one i hate and to let the one i hate become dear that what making way means
and to say to them god bless you go your way pass on while i while you that enough let go
upon my word i ll tell some one to prevent your going there said pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin looking at him what are you going to mokroe for now
there a woman there a woman that enough for you you shut up listen though you re such a savage i ve always liked you
i feel anxious thanks old fellow i a savage you say savages savages that what i am always saying savages
misha ran in post haste with a handful of notes in change and reported that every one was in a bustle at the plotnikovs they re carrying down the bottles and the fish and the tea it will all be ready directly
why here misha i was forgetting him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov seized ten roubles and handed it to pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin then tossed another ten rouble note to misha
dont dare to do such a thing cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin i wont have it in my house it a bad demoralizing habit
put your money away here put it here why waste it it would come in handy to morrow and i dare say you ll be coming to me to borrow ten roubles again
why do you keep putting the notes in your side pocket ah you ll lose them i say my dear fellow let go to mokroe together
what should i go for i say let open a bottle at once and drink to life i want to drink and especially to drink with you
i ve never drunk with you have i very well we can go to the metropolis i was just going there
i havent time for that let drink at the plotnikovs in the back room shall i ask you a riddle ask away
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov took the piece of paper out of his waistcoat pocket unfolded it and showed it in a large distinct hand was written i punish myself for my whole life my whole life i punish
i will certainly speak to some one i ll go at once said pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin after reading the paper you wont have time dear boy come and have a drink
it was the largest grocery shop in our town and by no means a bad one belonging to some rich merchants
they kept everything that could be got in a petersburg shop grocery of all sort wines bottled by the brothers eliseyev fruits cigars tea coffee sugar and so on
march plotnikov shop was at the corner of the street next door but one to pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin there were three shop assistants and two errand boys always employed
though our part of the country had grown poorer the landowners had gone away and trade had got worse yet the grocery stores flourished as before every year with increasing prosperity there were plenty of purchasers for their goods
they had vivid recollections of how he had bought three or four weeks ago wine and goods of all sort to the value of several hundred roubles paid for in cash they would never have let him have anything on credit of course
they remembered that then as now he had had a bundle of hundred rouble notes in his hand and had scattered them at random without bargaining without reflecting or caring to reflect what use so much wine and provisions would be to him
the story was told all over the town that driving off then with grushenka to mokroe he had spent three thousand in one night and the following day and had come back from the spree without a penny
he had picked up a whole troop of gypsies encamped in our neighborhood at the time who for two day got money without stint out of him while he was drunk and drank expensive wine without stint
people used to tell laughing at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov how he had given champagne to grimy handed peasants and feasted the village women and girls on sweets and strasburg pies
though to laugh at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to his face was rather a risky proceeding there was much laughter behind his back especially in the tavern at his own ingenuous public avowal that all he had got out of grushenka by this escapade was permission to kiss her foot and that was the utmost
by the time mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin reached the shop they found a cart with three horses harnessed abreast with bells and with andrey the driver ready waiting for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at the entrance
in the shop they had almost entirely finished packing one box of provisions and were only waiting for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart
they were awaiting mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with impatience in the shop she had allowed him pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin was astounded where did this cart come from in such a hurry
he asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i met andrey as i ran to you and told him to drive straight here to the shop
there no time to lose last time i drove with timofey but timofey now has gone on before me with the witch
shall we be very late andrey they ll only get there an hour at most before us not even that maybe
i got timofey ready to start i know how he ll go their pace wont be ours dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how could it be
they wont get there an hour earlier andrey a lanky red haired middle aged driver wearing a full skirted coat and with a kaftan on his arm replied warmly
fifty roubles for vodka if we re only an hour behind them i warrant the time dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov ech they wont be half an hour before us let alone an hour
though mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov bustled about seeing after things he gave his orders strangely as it were disconnectedly and inconsecutively he began a sentence and forgot the end of it
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin found himself obliged to come to the rescue four hundred roubles worth not less than four hundred roubles worth just as it was then commanded mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
four dozen champagne not a bottle less what do you want with so much what it for stay cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin
the officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that the first box contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne and only the most indispensable articles such as savories sweets toffee etc
but the main part of the goods ordered would be packed and sent off as on the previous occasion in a special cart also with three horses traveling at full speed so that it would arrive not more than an hour later than dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov himself
what this box what in it surely there isnt four hundred roubles worth here not more than an hour
not more than an hour and put in more toffee and fondants the girls there are so fond of it mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov insisted hotly
the fondants are all right but what do you want with four dozen of champagne one would be enough said pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin almost angry
he began bargaining asking for a bill of the goods and refused to be satisfied but he only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles
in the end it was agreed that only three hundred roubles worth should be sent well you may go to the devil
cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin on second thoughts what it to do with me throw away your money since it cost you nothing
this way my economist this way dont be angry mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov drew him into a room at the back of the shop
they ll give us a bottle here directly we ll taste it ech pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin come along with me for you re a nice fellow the sort i like
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sat down on a wicker chair before a little table covered with a dirty dinner napkin pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin sat down opposite and the champagne soon appeared and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen
first class oysters the last lot in hang the oysters i dont eat them and we dont need anything cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin almost angrily
there no time for oysters said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and i not hungry do you know friend he said suddenly with feeling i never have liked all this disorder
who does like it three dozen of champagne for peasants upon my word that enough to make any one angry
that not what i mean i talking of a higher order there no order in me no higher order but that all over
there no need to grieve about it it too late damn it my whole life has been disorder and one must set it in order
is that a pun eh you re raving not making puns glory be to god in heaven glory be to god in me
that verse came from my heart once it not a verse but a tear i made it myself not while i was pulling the captain beard though
why do you bring him in all of a sudden why do i bring him in foolery all things come to an end all things are made equal
that the long and short of it you know i keep thinking of your pistol that all foolery too
drink and dont be fanciful i love life i ve loved life too much shamefully much enough let drink to life dear boy i propose the toast
why am i pleased with myself i a scoundrel but i satisfied with myself and yet i tortured by the thought that i a scoundrel but satisfied with myself
i ready to bless god and his creation directly but i must kill one noxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others
i bless the creation let us drink to life dear brother what can be more precious than life nothing to life and to one queen of queens
let drink to life and to your queen too if you like they drank a glass each although mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was excited and expansive yet he was melancholy too
it was as though some heavy overwhelming anxiety were weighing upon him misha here your misha come misha come here my boy drink this glass to phoebus the golden haired of to morrow morn
what are you giving it him for cried pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin irritably yes yes yes let me i want to
ech misha emptied the glass bowed and ran out he ll remember it afterwards mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov remarked woman i love woman
what is woman the queen of creation my heart is sad my heart is sad pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin do you remember hamlet
i am very sorry good horatio alas poor yorick perhaps that me yorick yes i yorick now and a skull afterwards
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin listened in silence mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov too was silent for a while what dog that you ve got here he asked the shopman casually noticing a pretty little lap dog with dark eye sitting in the corner
it belongs to varvara alexyevna the mistress answered the clerk she brought it and forgot it here it must be taken back to her
i saw one like it in the regiment murmured mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov dreamily only that one had its hind leg broken
by the way pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin i wanted to ask you have you ever stolen anything in your life what a question
oh i didnt mean anything from somebody pocket you know i dont mean government money every one steals that and no doubt you do too
you go to the devil i talking of other people money stealing straight out of a pocket out of a purse eh
i stole twenty copecks from my mother when i was nine years old i took it off the table on the sly and held it tight in my hand
well and what happened oh nothing i kept it three day then i felt ashamed confessed and gave it back
and what then naturally i was whipped but why do you ask have you stolen something i have said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov winking slyly
what have you stolen inquired pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin curiously i stole twenty copecks from my mother when i was nine years old and gave it back three day after
as he said this mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly got up dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov wont you come now called andrey from the door of the shop
are you ready we ll come mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov started a few more last words and andrey a glass of vodka at starting
give him some brandy as well that box the one with the pistol put under my seat good by pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin dont remember evil against me
but you re coming back to morrow of course will you settle the little bill now cried the clerk springing forward
he pulled the bundle of notes out of his pocket again picked out three hundred roubles threw them on the counter and ran hurriedly out of the shop
oh yes the bill of course every one followed him out bowing and wishing him good luck andrey coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed jumped up on the box
but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise he saw fenya before him she ran up panting clasped her hands before him with a cry and plumped down at his feet
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dear good dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dont harm my mistress and it was i told you all about it and dont murder him he came first he her
he ll marry agrafena_alexandrovna now that why he come back from siberia dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dear dont take a fellow creature life
tut tut tut that it is it so you re off there to make trouble muttered pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin now it all clear as clear as daylight
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov give me your pistol at once if you mean to behave like a man he shouted aloud to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
do you hear dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov the pistol wait a bit brother i ll throw them into the pool on the road answered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
fenya get up dont kneel to me mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov wont hurt any one the silly fool wont hurt any one again
but i say fenya he shouted after having taken his seat i hurt you just now so forgive me and have pity on me forgive a scoundrel
but it doesnt matter if you dont it all the same now now then andrey look alive fly along full speed
andrey whipped up the horses and the bells began ringing good by pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin my last tear is for you
he had half a mind to stay and see the cart packed with the remaining wines and provisions knowing that they would deceive and defraud mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
he not drunk but he keeps babbling like a lunatic pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin thought as he watched him go but suddenly feeling vexed with himself he turned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play billiards
he a fool though he a good fellow he muttered as he went i ve heard of that officer grushenka former flame
well if he has turned up ech those pistol damn it all i not his nurse let them do what they like
besides it ll all come to nothing they re a set of brawlers that all they ll drink and fight fight and make friends again
they are not man who do anything real what does he mean by i stepping aside i punishing myself it ll come to nothing
he shouted such phrases a thousand time drunk in the taverns but now he not drunk drunk in spirit they re fond of fine phrases the villains
am i his nurse he must have been fighting his face was all over blood with whom i shall find out at the metropolis
and his handkerchief was soaked in blood it still lying on my floor hang it he reached the tavern in a bad humor and at once made up a game
he played a second game and suddenly began telling one of his partners that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov had come in for some cash again something like three thousand roubles and had gone to mokroe again to spend it with grushenka
the game cheered him this news roused singular interest in his listeners they all spoke of it not laughing but with a strange gravity
they left off playing three thousand but where can he have got three thousand questions were asked the story of madame_hohlakov present was received with skepticism
hasnt he robbed his old father_zossima that the question three thousand there something odd about it he boasted aloud that he would kill his father_zossima we all heard him here
and it was three thousand he talked about pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin listened all at once he became short and dry in his answers
he said not a word about the blood on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov face and hands though he had meant to speak of it at first
but by the end of the third game pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin felt no more desire for billiards he laid down the cue and without having supper as he had intended he walked out of the tavern
they began a third game and by degrees the talk about mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov died away when he reached the market place he stood still in perplexity wondering at himself
he realized that what he wanted was to go to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and find out if anything had happened there
on account of some stupid nonsense as it sure to turn out am i going to wake up the household and make a scandal
fooh damn it is it my business to look after them in a very bad humor he went straight home and suddenly remembered fenya
damn it all i ought to have questioned her just now he thought with vexation i should have heard everything
and the desire to speak to her and so find out became so pressing and importunate that when he was half way home he turned abruptly and went towards the house where grushenka lodged
going up to the gate he knocked the sound of the knock in the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed
and no one answered him every one in the house was asleep and i shall be making a fuss
he thought with a feeling of positive discomfort but instead of going away altogether he fell to knocking again with all his might filling the street with clamor
not coming well i will knock them up i will he muttered at each knock fuming at himself but at the same time he redoubled his knocks on the gate
it was a little more than twenty versts to mokroe but andrey three horses galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter
chapter vi i am coming too but dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was speeding along the road the swift motion revived mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the air was fresh and cool there were big stars shining in the sky
it was the very night and perhaps the very hour in which alyosha_karamazov fell on the earth and rapturously swore to love it for ever and ever
all was confusion confusion in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov soul but although many things were goading his heart at that moment his whole being was yearning for her his queen to whom he was flying to look on her for the last time
i shall perhaps not be believed when i say that this jealous lover felt not the slightest jealousy of this new rival who seemed to have sprung out of the earth
if any other had appeared on the scene he would have been jealous at once and would perhaps have stained his fierce hands with blood again
but as he flew through the night he felt no envy no hostility even for the man who had been her first lover
one thing i can say for certain his heart did not waver for one instant it is true he had not yet seen him
here there was no room for dispute it was her right and his this was her first love which after five years she had not forgotten so she had loved him only for those five years and i how do i come in
what right have i step aside mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and make way what am i now now everything is over apart from the officer even if he had not appeared everything would be over
these words would roughly have expressed his feeling if he had been capable of reasoning but he could not reason at that moment
his present plan of action had arisen without reasoning at fenya first words it had sprung from feeling and been adopted in a flash with all its consequences
and yet in spite of his resolution there was confusion in his soul an agonizing confusion his resolution did not give him peace
and it seemed strange to him at moments to think that he had written his own sentence of death with pen and paper i punish myself and the paper was lying there in his pocket ready the pistol was loaded he had already resolved how next morning he would meet the first warm ray of golden haired phoebus
and yet he could not be quit of the past of all that he had left behind and that tortured him
there was so much behind that tortured him he felt that miserably and the thought of it sank into his heart with despair
there was one moment when he felt an impulse to stop andrey to jump out of the cart to pull out his loaded pistol and to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn
the horses galloped on devouring space and as he drew near his goal again the thought of her of her alone took more and more complete possession of his soul chasing away the fearful images that had been haunting it
but that moment flew by like a spark oh how he longed to look upon her if only for a moment if only from a distance
she now with him he thought now i shall see what she looks like with him her first love and that all i want
never had this woman who was such a fateful influence in his life aroused such love in his breast such new and unknown feeling surprising even to himself a feeling tender to devoutness to self effacement before her
i will efface myself he said in a rush of almost hysterical ecstasy they had been galloping nearly an hour
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was silent and though andrey was as a rule a talkative peasant he did not utter a word either he seemed afraid to talk he only whipped up smartly his three lean but mettlesome bay horses
suddenly mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried out in horrible anxiety andrey what if they re asleep this thought fell upon him like a blow
it had not occurred to him before it may well be that they re gone to bed by now dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov frowned as though in pain yes indeed he was rushing there with such feeling while they were asleep
she was asleep perhaps there too an angry feeling surged up in his heart drive on andrey whip them up
look alive he cried beside himself but maybe they re not in bed andrey went on after a pause
timofey said they were a lot of them there at the station not at the posting station but at plastunov at the inn where they let out horses too
i know so you say there are a lot of them how that who are they cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov greatly dismayed at this unexpected news
well timofey was saying they re all gentlefolk two from our town who they are i cant say and there are two others strangers maybe more besides
i didnt ask particularly they ve set to playing cards so timofey said cards so maybe they re not in bed if they re at cards
it most likely not more than eleven quicker andrey quicker mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried again nervously may i ask you something sir said andrey after a pause
why fenya threw herself at your feet just now and begged you not to harm her mistress and some one else too
only i afraid of angering you sir what is it so you see sir it i am taking you there
forgive me sir it my conscience maybe it stupid of me to speak of it mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly seized him by the shoulders from behind
are you a driver he asked frantically yes sir then you know that one has to make way
what would you say to a driver who wouldnt make way for any one but would just drive on and crush people
no a driver mustnt run over people one cant run over a man one cant spoil people lives and if you have spoilt a life punish yourself
if only you ve spoilt if only you ve ruined any one life punish yourself and go away these phrases burst from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov almost hysterically
that right dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you re quite right one mustnt crush or torment a man or any kind of creature for every creature is created by god
though andrey was surprised at him he kept up the conversation take a horse for instance for some folks even among us drivers drive anyhow
nothing will restrain them they just force it along to hell mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov interrupted and went off into his abrupt short laugh
andrey simple soul he seized him by the shoulders again tell me will dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov go to hell or not what do you think
you see sir when the son of god was nailed on the cross and died he went straight down to hell from the cross and set free all sinners that were in agony
i dont know darling it depends on you for you are and the devil groaned because he thought that he would get no more sinners in hell
and god said to him then dont groan for you shall have all the mighty of the earth the rulers the chief judges and the rich man and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till i come again
so you see sir who it is hell for said andrey whipping up the left horse but you re like a little child
those were his very words a peasant legend capital whip up the left andrey that how we look on you
and though you re hasty tempered sir yet god will forgive you for your kind heart and you do you forgive me andrey
what should i forgive you for sir you ve never done me any harm no for every one for every one you here alone on the road will you forgive me for every one
speak simple peasant heart oh sir i feel afraid of driving you your talk is so strange but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov did not hear
he was frantically praying and muttering to himself lord receive me with all my lawlessness and do not condemn me
let me pass by thy judgment do not condemn me for i have condemned myself do not condemn me for i love thee lord
if thou sendest me to hell i shall love thee there and from there i shall cry out that i love thee for ever and ever
here and now for just five hours till the first light of thy day for i love the queen of my soul
i am a wretch but i love thee but let me love to the end i love her and i cannot help loving her
thou seest my whole heart i shall gallop up i shall fall before her and say you are right to pass on and leave me
through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass of buildings flung down as it were in the vast plain
the village of mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants but at that hour all were asleep and only here and there a few lights still twinkled
farewell and forget your victim never fret yourself about me mokroe cried andrey pointing ahead with his whip
they re not asleep said andrey again pointing with his whip to the plastunovs inn which was at the entrance to the village
drive on andrey i come mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov exclaimed feverishly the six windows looking on the street were all brightly lighted up
they re not asleep mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov repeated joyously quicker andrey gallop drive up with a dash set the bells ringing let all know that i have come
andrey lashed his exhausted team into a gallop drove with a dash and pulled up his steaming panting horses at the high flight of steps
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper on his way to bed peeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived
i coming i coming too trifon_borissovitch is that you the innkeeper bent down looked intently ran down the steps and rushed up to the guest with obsequious delight
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov your honor do i see you again trifon_borissovitch was a thick set healthy peasant of middle height with a rather fat face
his expression was severe and uncompromising especially with the peasants of mokroe but he had the power of assuming the most obsequious countenance when he had an inkling that it was to his interest
he dressed in russian style with a shirt buttoning down on one side and a full skirted coat he had saved a good sum of money but was for ever dreaming of improving his position
from the neighboring landowners he bought and rented land which were worked by the peasants in payment of debts which they could never shake off
more than half the peasants were in his clutches every one in the neighborhood was in debt to him he was a widower with four grown up daughters
one of them was already a widow and lived in the inn with her two child his grandchildren and worked for him like a charwoman
another of his daughters was married to a petty official and in one of the rooms of the inn on the wall could be seen among the family photographs a miniature photograph of this official in uniform and official epaulettes
the two younger daughters used to wear fashionable blue or green dresses fitting tight at the back and with trains a yard long on church_of_christ holidays or when they went to pay visits
but next morning they would get up at dawn as usual sweep out the rooms with a birch broom empty the slops and clean up after lodgers
in spite of the thousands of roubles he had saved trifon_borissovitch was very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest and remembering that not a month ago he had in twenty four hours made two if not three hundred roubles out of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
when he had come on his escapade with grushenka he met him now with eager welcome scenting his prey the moment mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov drove up to the steps
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dear sir we see you once more stay trifon_borissovitch began mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov first and foremost where is she
agrafena_alexandrovna the inn keeper understood at once looking sharply into mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov face she here too with whom with whom
he sent the horses for her from here and there another with him a friend of his or a fellow traveler there no telling
some strangers one is an official gentleman a pole to judge from his speech they re dressed like civilians well are they feasting
have they money poor sort of a feast nothing to boast of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nothing to boast of and who are the others
they re two gentlemen from the town they ve come back from tcherny and are putting up here one quite a young gentleman a relative of mr pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov he must be but i ve forgotten his name
and i expect you know the other too a gentleman called maximov he been on a pilgrimage so he says to the monastery in the town
he traveling with this young relation of mr pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov is that all yes stay listen trifon_borissovitch tell me the chief thing
what of her how is she oh she only just come she sitting with them is she cheerful is she laughing
no i think she not laughing much she sitting quite dull she combing the young gentleman hair the pole the officer
he not young and he not an officer either not him sir it the young gentleman that mr pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov relation
i ve forgotten his name pyotr_fomitch_kalganov that it pyotr_fomitch_kalganov all right i ll see for myself are they playing cards
they have been playing but they ve left off they ve been drinking tea the official gentleman asked for liqueurs stay trifon_borissovitch stay my good soul i ll see for myself
now answer one more question are the gypsies here you cant have the gypsies now dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov the authorities have sent them away
but we ve jews that play the cymbals and the fiddle in the village so one might send for them they come
send for them certainly send for them cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and you can get the girls together as you did then marya_kondratyevna especially stepanida too and arina
two hundred roubles for a chorus oh for a sum like that i can get all the village together though by now they re asleep
are the peasants here worth such kindness dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov or the girls either to spend a sum like that on such coarseness and rudeness
what the good of giving a peasant a cigar to smoke the stinking ruffian and the girls are all lousy besides i ll get my daughters up for nothing let alone a sum like that
they ve only just gone to bed i ll give them a kick and set them singing for you you gave the peasants champagne to drink the other day ech
for all his pretended compassion for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov trifon_borissovitch had hidden half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion and had picked up a hundred rouble note under the table and it had remained in his clutches
trifon_borissovitch i sent more than one thousand flying last time i was here do you remember you did send it flying
i may well remember you must have left three thousand behind you well i ve come to do the same again do you see
and he pulled out his roll of notes and held them up before the innkeeper nose now listen and remember
in an hour time the wine will arrive savories pies and sweets bring them all up at once that box andrey has got is to be brought up at once too
open it and hand champagne immediately and the girls we must have the girls marya_kondratyevna especially he turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistol
here andrey let settle here fifteen roubles for the drive and fifty for vodka for your readiness for your love
remember alyosha_karamazov i afraid sir faltered andrey give me five roubles extra but more i wont take trifon_borissovitch bear witness
forgive my foolish words what are you afraid of asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov scanning him well go to the devil if that it
now trifon_borissovitch take me up quietly and let me first get a look at them so that they dont see me
he cried flinging him five roubles where are they in the blue room trifon_borissovitch looked apprehensively at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov but at once obediently did his bidding
leading him into the passage he went himself into the first large room adjoining that in which the visitors were sitting and took the light away
then he stealthily led mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in and put him in a corner in the dark whence he could freely watch the company without being seen
but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov did not look long and indeed he could not see them he saw her his heart throbbed violently and all was dark before his eye
she was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair and beside her on the sofa was the pretty youth pyotr_fomitch_kalganov
she was holding his hand and seemed to be laughing while he seeming vexed and not looking at her was saying something in a loud voice to maximov who sat the other side of the table facing grushenka
maximov was laughing violently at something on the sofa sat he and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger
the one on the sofa was lolling backwards smoking a pipe and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had an impression of a stoutish broad faced short little man who was apparently angry about something
his friend the other stranger struck mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as extraordinarily tall but he could make out nothing more he caught his breath
he could not bear it for a minute he put the pistol case on a chest and with a throbbing heart he walked feeling cold all over straight into the blue room to face the company
aie shrieked grushenka the first to notice him chapter vii the first and rightful lover with his long rapid strides mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov walked straight up to the table
gentlemen he said in a loud voice almost shouting yet stammering at every word i i all right dont be afraid
he exclaimed i there nothing the matter he turned suddenly to grushenka who had shrunk back in her chair towards pyotr_fomitch_kalganov and clasped his hand tightly
i i coming too i here till morning gentlemen may i stay with you till morning only till morning for the last time in this same room
so he finished turning to the fat little man with the pipe sitting on the sofa the latter removed his pipe from his lips with dignity and observed severely panie we re here in private
there are other rooms why it you dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov what do you mean answered pyotr_fomitch_kalganov suddenly sit down with us
how are you delighted to see you dear and precious fellow i always thought a lot of you mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov responded joyfully and eagerly at once holding out his hand across the table
he always squeezes like that always grushenka put in gayly with a timid smile seeming suddenly convinced from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov face that he was not going to make a scene
aie how tight you squeeze you ve quite broken my fingers laughed pyotr_fomitch_kalganov she was watching him with intense curiosity and still some uneasiness
she was impressed by something about him and indeed the last thing she expected of him was that he would come in and speak like this at such a moment
good evening maximov ventured blandly on the left mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov rushed up to him too good evening you re here too
gentlemen gentlemen i he addressed the polish gentleman with the pipe again evidently taking him for the most important person present
i wanted to spend my last day my last hour in this room in this very room where i too adored my queen
how glad i am to find you here too i flew here forgive me panie he cried wildly i flew here
and vowed oh dont be afraid it my last night let drink to our good understanding they ll bring the wine at once
i brought this with me something made him pull out his bundle of notes allow me panie i want to have music singing a revel as we had before
but the worm the unnecessary worm will crawl away and there ll be no more of him i will commemorate my day of joy on my last night
he was almost choking there was so much so much he wanted to say but strange exclamations were all that came from his lips
the pole gazed fixedly at him at the bundle of notes in his hand looked at grushenka and was in evident perplexity
if my suverin lady is permitting he was beginning what does suverin mean sovereign i suppose interrupted grushenka
i cant help laughing at you the way you talk sit down mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov what are you talking about dont frighten us please
you wont frighten us will you if you wont i am glad to see you me me frighten you
and suddenly he surprised them all and no doubt himself as well by flinging himself on a chair and bursting into tears turning his head away to the opposite wall while his arms clasped the back of the chair tight as though embracing it
cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov flinging up his hands oh pass me by go your way i wont hinder you
come come what a fellow you are cried grushenka reproachfully that just how he comes to see me he begins talking and i cant make out what he means
he cried like that once before and now he crying again it shameful why are you crying as though you had anything to cry for
he instantly turned round in his chair and suddenly laughed not his abrupt wooden laugh but a long quivering inaudible nervous laugh
she added enigmatically emphasizing each word with some irritability i i not crying well good evening
well there you are again come cheer up cheer up grushenka said to him persuasively i very glad you ve come very glad mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov do you hear i very glad
i want him to stay here with us she said peremptorily addressing the whole company though her words were obviously meant for the man sitting on the sofa
i wish it i wish it and if he goes away i shall go too she added with flashing eye
what my queen commands is law pronounced the pole gallantly kissing grushenka hand i beg you panie to join our company he added politely addressing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering another tirade but the words did not come let drink panie he blurted out instead of making a speech
every one laughed good heavens i thought he was going to begin again grushenka exclaimed nervously do you hear mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov she went on insistently dont prance about but it nice
you ve brought the champagne i want some myself and i cant bear liqueurs and best of all you ve come yourself we were fearfully dull here
you ve come for a spree again i suppose but put your money in your pocket where did you get such a lot
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had been all this time holding in his hand the crumpled bundle of notes on which the eye of all especially of the poles were fixed
in confusion he thrust them hurriedly into his pocket he flushed at that moment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked bottle of champagne and glasses on a tray
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov snatched up the bottle but he was so bewildered that he did not know what to do with it pyotr_fomitch_kalganov took it from him and poured out the champagne
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried to the innkeeper and forgetting to clink glasses with the pole whom he had so solemnly invited to drink to their good understanding he drank off his glass without waiting for any one else
the solemn and tragic expression with which he had entered vanished completely and a look of something childlike came into his face
he looked shyly and happily at every one with a continual nervous little laugh and the blissful expression of a dog who has done wrong been punished and forgiven
another another bottle his whole countenance suddenly changed he seemed to have become suddenly gentle and subdued he seemed to have forgotten everything and was looking round at every one with a childlike smile of delight
by degrees he had gained some idea of the two poles though he had formed no definite conception of them yet
the pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor and his polish accent and above all by his pipe
he looked at grushenka laughing continually and bringing his chair close up to her well what of it it a good thing he smoking a pipe he reflected
the pole puffy middle aged face with its tiny nose and two very thin pointed dyed and impudent looking mustaches had not so far roused the faintest doubts in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
he was not even particularly struck by the pole absurd wig made in siberia with love locks foolishly combed forward over the temples
the other younger pole who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company and listening to the conversation with silent contempt still only impressed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov by his great height which was in striking contrast to the pole on the sofa
i suppose it all right since he wears a wig he went on musing blissfully if he stood up he be six foot three
it occurred to him too that this pole must be the friend of the other as it were a bodyguard and no doubt the big pole was at the disposal of the little pole with the pipe
the thought flitted through mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mind but this all seemed to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov perfectly right and not to be questioned in his mood of doglike submissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away
all he understood with thrilling heart was that she was kind to him that she had forgiven him and made him sit by her
grushenka mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her words he completely failed to grasp he was beside himself with delight watching her sip her glass of champagne
the silence of the company seemed somehow to strike him however and he looked round at every one with expectant eye
why are we sitting here though gentlemen why dont you begin doing something his smiling eye seemed to ask
he keeps talking nonsense and we were all laughing pyotr_fomitch_kalganov began suddenly as though divining his thought and pointing to maximov
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov immediately stared at pyotr_fomitch_kalganov and then at maximov he talking nonsense he laughed his short wooden laugh seeming suddenly delighted at something ha ha
yes would you believe it he will have it that all our cavalry officers in the twenties married polish women
pyotr_fomitch_kalganov was well aware of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov attitude to grushenka and he guessed about the pole too but that did not so much interest him perhaps did not interest him at all what he was interested in was maximov
he had come here with maximov by chance and he met the poles here at the inn for the first time in his life
grushenka he knew before and had once been with some one to see her but she had not taken to him
but here she looked at him very affectionately before mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov arrival she had been making much of him but he seemed somehow to be unmoved by it
he was a boy not over twenty dressed like a dandy with a very charming fair skinned face and splendid thick fair hair
from his fair face looked out beautiful pale blue eye with an intelligent and sometimes even deep expression beyond his age indeed although the young man sometimes looked and talked quite like a child and was not at all ashamed of it even when he was aware of it himself
that awful rot isnt it polish women repeated mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov perfectly ecstatic as a rule he was very willful even capricious though always friendly
sometimes there was something fixed and obstinate in his expression he would look at you and listen seeming all the while to be persistently dreaming over something else
often he was listless and lazy at other time he would grow excited sometimes apparently over the most trivial matters
only imagine i ve been taking him about with me for the last four day he went on indolently drawling his words quite naturally though without the slightest affectation
that made me take an interest in him at the time and i took him into the country but he keeps talking such rot
ever since your brother do you remember shoved him off the carriage and sent him flying i ashamed to be with him
i taking him back the gentleman has not seen polish lady and says what is impossible the pole with the pipe observed to maximov
he spoke russian fairly well much better anyway than he pretended if he used russian words he always distorted them into a polish form
but i was married to a polish lady myself tittered maximov but did you serve in the cavalry you were talking about the cavalry
cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov listening eagerly and turning his inquiring eye to each as he spoke as though there were no knowing what he might hear from each
were you a cavalry officer put in pyotr_fomitch_kalganov at once was he a cavalry officer indeed ha ha
what i mean is that those pretty polish lady when they danced the mazurka with our uhlans when one of them dances a mazurka with a uhlan she jumps on his knee like a kitten a little white one and the pan father_zossima
no you see maximov turned to him and pan mother look on and allow it they allow it and next day the uhlan comes and offers her his hand
the pan is a lajdak the tall pole on the chair growled suddenly and crossed one leg over the other
that how it is offers her his hand he he maximov ended tittering mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov eye was caught by his huge greased boot with its thick dirty sole
the dress of both the poles looked rather greasy well now it lajdak what he scolding about said grushenka suddenly vexed
pani agrippina what the gentleman saw in poland were servant girls and not lady of good birth the pole with the pipe observed to grushenka
you can reckon on that the tall pole snapped contemptuously what next let him talk people talk why hinder them
i not hindering them pani said the pole in the wig with a long look at grushenka and relapsing into dignified silence he sucked his pipe again
it makes it cheerful grushenka said crossly no no the polish gentleman spoke the truth pyotr_fomitch_kalganov got excited again as though it were a question of vast import
he never been in poland so how can he talk about it i suppose you werent married in poland were you
only a uhlan had brought her to russia before that my future wife with her mamma and her aunt and another female relation with a grown up son
no in the province of smolensk he brought her straight from poland and gave her up to me he was a lieutenant in our regiment a very nice young man
at first he meant to marry her himself but he didnt marry her because she turned out to be lame so you married a lame woman cried pyotr_fomitch_kalganov
yes they both deceived me a little bit at the time and concealed it i thought she was hopping she kept hopping
i thought it was for fun so pleased she was going to marry you yelled pyotr_fomitch_kalganov in a ringing childish voice
yes so pleased but it turned out to be quite a different cause afterwards when we were married after the wedding that very evening she confessed and very touchingly asked forgiveness
i once jumped over a puddle when i was a child she said and injured my leg he he pyotr_fomitch_kalganov went off into the most childish laughter almost falling on the sofa
do you know that the truth he not lying now exclaimed pyotr_fomitch_kalganov turning to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and do you know he been married twice
grushenka too laughed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was at the pinnacle of happiness it his first wife he talking about but his second wife do you know ran away and is alive now
is it possible said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov turning quickly to maximov with an expression of the utmost astonishment yes she did run away
i ve had that unpleasant experience maximov modestly assented with a monsieur and what was worse she had all my little property transferred to her beforehand
you re an educated man she said to me you can always get your living she settled my business with that
a venerable bishop once said to me one of your wives was lame but the other was too light footed he he
listen listen cried pyotr_fomitch_kalganov bubbling over if he telling lies and he often is he only doing it to amuse us all
there no harm in that is there you know i sometimes like him he awfully low but it natural to him eh
dont you think so some people are low from self interest but he simply so from nature only fancy he claims he was arguing about it all the way yesterday that gogol wrote dead soul about him
do you remember there a landowner called maximov in it whom nozdryov thrashed he was charged do you remember for inflicting bodily injury with rods on the landowner maximov in a drunken condition
would you believe it he claims that he was that maximov and that he was beaten now can it be so
tchitchikov made his journey at the very latest at the beginning of the twenties so that the dates dont fit he couldnt have been thrashed then he couldnt could he
it was difficult to imagine what pyotr_fomitch_kalganov was excited about but his excitement was genuine mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov followed his lead without protest
well but if they did thrash him he cried laughing it not that they thrashed me exactly but what i mean is put in maximov
what do you mean either they thrashed you or they didnt what clock is it panie the pole with the pipe asked his tall friend with a bored expression
the other shrugged his shoulders in reply neither of them had a watch why not talk let other people talk
mustnt other people talk because you re bored grushenka flew at him with evident intention of finding fault something seemed for the first time to flash upon mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mind
this time the pole answered with unmistakable irritability pani i didnt oppose it i didnt say anything all right then
come tell us your story grushenka cried to maximov why are you all silent there nothing to tell it all so foolish answered maximov at once with evident satisfaction mincing a little
besides all that by way of allegory in gogol for he made all the names have a meaning nozdryov was really called nosov and kuvshinikov had quite a different name he was called shkvornev
fenardi really was called fenardi only he wasnt an italian but a russian and mamsel fenardi was a pretty girl with her pretty little legs in tights and she had a little short skirt with spangles and she kept turning round and round only not for four hours but for four minutes only and she bewitched every one
but what were you beaten for cried pyotr_fomitch_kalganov for piron answered maximov what piron cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
the famous french writer piron we were all drinking then a big party of us in a tavern at that very fair
they invited me and first of all i began quoting epigrams is that you boileau what a funny get up and boileau answers that he going to a masquerade
and they took it to themselves so i made haste to repeat another very sarcastic well known to all educated people
that is to the baths he he yes sappho and phaon are we but one grief is weighing on me
you dont know your way to the sea they were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly way for it
and as ill luck would have it to set things right i began telling a very cultivated anecdote about piron how he was not accepted into the french academy and to revenge himself wrote his own epitaph
ci gît piron qui ne fut rien pas męme académicien they seized me and thrashed me but what for what for
for my education people can thrash a man for anything maximov concluded briefly and sententiously eh that enough that all stupid i dont want to listen
the tall pole rose upon his feet and with the haughty air of a man bored and out of his element began pacing from corner to corner of the room his hands behind his back
i thought it would be amusing grushenka cut them short suddenly mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov started and at once left off laughing ah he cant sit still said grushenka looking at him contemptuously
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began to feel anxious he noticed besides that the pole on the sofa was looking at him with an irritable expression
panie cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov let drink and the other pan too let us drink in a flash he had pulled three glasses towards him and filled them with champagne
i shall be delighted panie said the pole on the sofa with dignity and affable condescension and he took his glass
to poland panovie i drink to your poland cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and the other pan what his name
drink most illustrious take your glass mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov urged pan_vrublevsky put in the pole on the sofa pan_vrublevsky came up to the table swaying as he walked
to poland panovie cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov raising his glass hurrah all three drank mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov seized the bottle and again poured out three glasses
now to russia panovie and let us be brothers pour out some for us said grushenka i ll drink to russia too
so will i said pyotr_fomitch_kalganov and i would too to russia the old grandmother tittered maximov all
all cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov trifon_borissovitch some more bottles the other three bottles mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had brought with him were put on the table
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov filled the glasses to russia hurrah he shouted again all drank the toast except the poles and grushenka tossed off her whole glass at once
the poles did not touch theirs how this panovie cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov wont you drink it pan_vrublevsky took the glass raised it and said with a resonant voice
to russia as she was before come that better cried the other pole and they both emptied their glasses at once
you re fools you panovie broke suddenly from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov panie shouted both the poles menacingly setting on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov like a couple of cocks
pan_vrublevsky was specially furious can one help loving one own country he shouted be silent dont quarrel
i wont have any quarreling cried grushenka imperiously and she stamped her foot on the floor her face glowed her eye were shining
the effects of the glass she had just drunk were apparent mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was terribly alarmed panovie forgive me it was my fault i sorry
pan_vrublevsky panie pan_vrublevsky i sorry hold your tongue you anyway sit down you stupid grushenka scolded with angry annoyance every one sat down all were silent looking at one another
gentlemen i was the cause of it all mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began again unable to make anything of grushenka words come why are we sitting here
what shall we do to amuse ourselves again ach it certainly anything but amusing pyotr_fomitch_kalganov mumbled lazily let play faro again as we did just now maximov tittered suddenly
faro splendid cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov if only the panovie it lite panovie the pole on the sofa responded as it were unwillingly
that true assented pan_vrublevsky lite what do you mean by lite asked grushenka late pani
a late hour i mean the pole on the sofa explained it always late with them they can never do anything
grushenka almost shrieked in her anger they re dull themselves so they want others to be dull before you came mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov they were just as silent and kept turning up their noses at me
my goddess cried the pole on the sofa i see you re not well disposed to me that why i gloomy i ready panie added he addressing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
begin panie mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov assented pulling his notes out of his pocket and laying two hundred rouble notes on the table
i want to lose a lot to you take your cards make the bank we ll have cards from the landlord panie said the little pole gravely and emphatically
that much the best way chimed in pan_vrublevsky from the landlord very good i understand let get them from him
the landlord brought in a new unopened pack and informed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that the girls were getting ready and that the jews with the cymbals would most likely be here soon but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders but only three girls had arrived and marya_kondratyevna was not there yet
cards mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov shouted to the landlord and he did not know himself what orders to give and why he had run out
he only told them to take out of the box the presents for the girls the sweets the toffee and the fondants
and vodka for andrey vodka for andrey he cried in haste i was rude to andrey suddenly maximov who had followed him out touched him on the shoulder
give me five roubles he whispered to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i ll stake something at faro too he he capital splendid take ten here
again he took all the notes out of his pocket and picked out one for ten roubles and if you lose that come again come again
very good maximov whispered joyfully and he ran back again mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov too returned apologizing for having kept them waiting the poles had already sat down and opened the pack
they looked much more amiable almost cordial the pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was preparing to throw
he wore an air of solemnity to your places gentlemen cried pan_vrublevsky no i not going to play any more observed pyotr_fomitch_kalganov i ve lost fifty roubles to them just now
the pan had no luck perhaps he ll be lucky this time the pole on the sofa observed in his direction
how much in the bank to correspond asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that according panie maybe a hundred maybe two hundred as much as you will stake
a million laughed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the pan captain has heard of pan podvysotsky perhaps what podvysotsky in warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes against it
the banker says panie podvysotsky are you laying down the gold or must we trust to your honor to my honor panie says podvysotsky
podvysotsky comes sees a thousand gold pieces stakes against the bank so much the better the banker throws the dice podvysotsky wins

podvysotsky took the million that not true said pyotr_fomitch_kalganov panie pyotr_fomitch_kalganov in gentlemanly society one doesnt say such things
forgive me panie it my fault again he would he would give away a million for honor for polish honor
as if a polish gambler would give away a million cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov but checked himself at once you see how i talk polish ha ha
and i put a rouble on the queen the queen of hearts the pretty little panienotchka he he laughed maximov pulling out his queen and as though trying to conceal it from every one he moved right up and crossed himself hurriedly under the table
here i stake ten roubles the knave leads mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov won the rouble won too a corner cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
i ll bet another rouble a single stake maximov muttered gleefully hugely delighted at having won a rouble lost shouted mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
a double on the seven the seven too was trumped stop cried pyotr_fomitch_kalganov suddenly double double mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov doubled his stakes and each time he doubled the stake the card he doubled was trumped by the poles
the rouble stakes kept winning on the double shouted mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov furiously you ve lost two hundred panie will you stake another hundred
and pulling his money out of his pocket mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was about to fling two hundred roubles on the queen but pyotr_fomitch_kalganov covered it with his hand
the pole on the sofa inquired what lost two hundred already then another two hundred all doubles that enough
he shouted in his ringing voice what the matter mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stared at him that enough i dont want you to play any more
dont why because i dont hang it come away that why i wont let you go on playing
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov gazed at him in astonishment give it up mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he may be right you ve lost a lot as it is said grushenka with a curious note in her voice
both the poles rose from their seats with a deeply offended air are you joking panie said the short man looking severely at pyotr_fomitch_kalganov
how dare you pan_vrublevsky too growled at pyotr_fomitch_kalganov dont dare to shout like that cried grushenka ah you turkey cocks
but something in grushenka face suddenly struck him and at the same instant something new flashed into his mind a strange new thought
pani agrippina the little pole was beginning crimson with anger when mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looked at each of them in turn most illustrious two words with you what do you want
in the next room i ve two words to say to you something pleasant very pleasant you ll be glad to hear it
the little pan was taken aback and looked apprehensively at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he agreed at once however on condition that pan_vrublevsky went with them
the bodyguard let him come and i want him too i must have him cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov march panovie
where are you going asked grushenka anxiously we ll be back in one moment answered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov there was a sort of boldness a sudden confidence shining in his eye
he led the poles not into the large room where the chorus of girls was assembling and the table was being laid but into the bedroom on the right where the trunks and packages were kept and there were two large beds with pyramids of cotton pillows on each
his face had looked very different when he entered the room an hour before there was a lighted candle on a small deal table in the corner
the small man and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sat down to this table facing each other while the huge pan_vrublevsky stood beside them his hands behind his back
the poles looked severe but were evidently inquisitive what can i do for you panie lisped the little pole
well look here panie i wont keep you long there money for you he pulled out his notes
would you like three thousand take it and go your way the pole gazed open eyed at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with a searching look
three thousand panie he exchanged glances with pan_vrublevsky three panovie three listen panie i see you re a sensible man
take three thousand and go to the devil and pan_vrublevsky with you you hear but at once this very minute and for ever
you understand that panie for ever here the door you go out of it what have you got there a great coat a fur coat
i ll bring it out to you they ll get the horses out directly and then good by panie mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov awaited an answer with assurance
he had no doubts an expression of extraordinary resolution passed over the pole face and the money panie
i ll give you this moment for the journey and as a first installment and two thousand five hundred to morrow in the town i swear on my honor i ll get it i ll get it at any cost
the money panie five hundred roubles cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the poles exchanged glances again the short man face looked more forbidding
seven hundred seven hundred not five hundred at once this minute cash down mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov added feeling something wrong what the matter panie
dont you trust me i cant give you the whole three thousand straight off if i give it you may come back to her to morrow
besides i havent the three thousand with me i ve got it at home in the town faltered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov his spirit sinking at every word he uttered
upon my word the money there hidden in an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in the little man face
you do that panie said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov recognizing with despair that all was over because you hope to make more out of grushenka
what next he asked ironically for shame and he spat on the floor pan_vrublevsky spat too you re a couple of capons that what you are
the little pole turned as red as a crab and he went out of the room briskly as though unwilling to hear another word
this is a mortal insult pan_vrublevsky swung out after him and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov followed confused and crestfallen he was afraid of grushenka afraid that the pan would at once raise an outcry
and so indeed he did the pole walked into the room and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before grushenka
pani agrippina i have received a mortal insult he exclaimed but grushenka suddenly lost all patience as though they had wounded her in the tenderest spot
speak russian speak russian she cried not another word of polish you used to talk russian you cant have forgotten it in five years
she was red with passion pani agrippina my name agrafena_alexandrovna grushenka speak russian or i wont listen the pole gasped with offended dignity and quickly and pompously delivered himself in broken russian
pani agrafena_alexandrovna i came here to forget the past and forgive it to forget all that has happened till to day
forgive came here to forgive me grushenka cut him short jumping up from her seat just so pani i not pusillanimous
i magnanimous but i was astounded when i saw your lovers pan mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov offered me three thousand in the other room to depart
i spat in the pan face what he offered you money for me cried grushenka hysterically is it true mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
how dare you am i for sale panie panie yelled mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov she pure and shining and i have never been her lover
it wasnt virtue kept me pure and it wasnt that i was afraid of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov but that i might hold up my head when i met him and tell him he a scoundrel
that a lie how dare you defend me to him shrieked grushenka and he did actually refuse the money
cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov only he wanted to get the whole three thousand at once and i could only give him seven hundred straight off
he took it he took it i see he heard i had money and came here to marry me
pani agrippina cried the little pole i a knight i a nobleman and not a lajdak i came here to make you my wife
and i find you a different woman perverse and shameless oh go back where you came from i ll tell them to turn you out and you ll be turned out cried grushenka furious
i ve been a fool a fool to have been miserable these five years and it wasnt for his sake it was my anger made me miserable
and this isnt he at all was he like this it might be his father_zossima where did you get your wig from
he was a falcon but this is a gander he used to laugh and sing to me and i ve been crying for five years damned fool abject shameless
i was she sank back in her low chair and hid her face in her hands at that instant the chorus of mokroe began singing in the room on the left a rollicking dance song
the landlord who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in at the door hearing shouts and guessing that his guests were quarreling at once entered the room
a regular sodom pan_vrublevsky roared suddenly landlord send the shameless hussies away what are you shouting for
d you want to split your throat he said addressing pan_vrublevsky with surprising rudeness animal bellowed pan_vrublevsky animal and what sort of cards were you playing with just now
i could send you to siberia for playing with false cards you know that for it just the same as false banknotes
and going up to the sofa he thrust his fingers between the sofa back and the cushion and pulled out an unopened pack of cards
i gave you a pack and you hid it you played with marked cards here my pack unopened he held it up and showed it to all in the room
from where i stood i saw him slip my pack away and put his in place of it you re a cheat and not a gentleman
and i twice saw the pan change a card cried pyotr_fomitch_kalganov how shameful how shameful exclaimed grushenka clasping her hands and blushing for genuine shame
but before he had uttered the words pan_vrublevsky with a confused and infuriated face shook his fist at grushenka shouting you low harlot
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov flew at him at once clutched him in both hands lifted him in the air and in one instant had carried him into the room on the right from which they had just come
good lord he come to that i thought so too said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i ve laid him on the floor there he announced returning at once gasping with excitement
he closed one half of the folding doors and holding the other ajar called out to the little pole most illustrious will you be pleased to retire as well
he struggling the scoundrel but he wont come back no fear of that my dear dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said trifon_borissovitch make them give you back the money you lost
it as good as stolen from you i dont want my fifty roubles back pyotr_fomitch_kalganov declared suddenly i dont want my two hundred either cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i wouldnt take it for anything
let him keep it as a consolation bravo mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov you re a trump mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried grushenka and there was a note of fierce anger in the exclamation
the little pan crimson with fury but still mindful of his dignity was making for the door but he stopped short and said suddenly addressing grushenka pani if you want to come with me come
this was a man of character he had so good an opinion of himself that after all that had passed he still expected that she would marry him
if not good by and swelling with indignation and importance he went to the door mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov slammed the door after him
lock it said pyotr_fomitch_kalganov but the key clicked on the other side they had locked it from within that capital
exclaimed grushenka relentlessly serve them right chapter viii delirium what followed was almost an orgy a feast to which all were welcome
grushenka was the first to call for wine i want to drink i want to be quite drunk as we were before
do you remember mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov do you remember how we made friends here last time mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov himself was almost delirious feeling that his happiness was at hand
tell them to dance to make merry let the stove and cottage dance as we had it last time she kept exclaiming
but grushenka was continually sending him away from her go and enjoy yourself she was tremendously excited and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hastened to obey her
the room in which they had been sitting till that moment was too small and was divided in two by cotton curtains behind which was a huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows
the chorus were in the next room in the four rooms for visitors there were beds grushenka settled herself just at the door
she had sat in the same place to watch the dancing and singing the time before when they had made merry there
all the girls who had come had been there then the jewish band with fiddles and zithers had come too and at last the long expected cart had arrived with the wines and provisions
all sort of people began coming into the room to look on peasants and their women who had been roused from sleep and attracted by the hopes of another marvelous entertainment such as they had enjoyed a month before
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov set an easy chair for her mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov bustled about mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov remembered their faces greeting and embracing every one he knew
he uncorked bottles and poured out wine for every one who presented himself only the girls were very eager for the champagne
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had chocolate made for all the girls and ordered that three samovars should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone to help himself
an absurd chaotic confusion followed but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was in his natural element and the more foolish it became the more his spirits rose
if the peasants had asked him for money at that moment he would have pulled out his notes and given them away right and left
the man preferred rum brandy and above all hot punch this was probably why the landlord trifon_borissovitch kept hovering about mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to protect him
he seemed to have given up all idea of going to bed that night but he drank little only one glass of punch and kept a sharp look out on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov interests after his own fashion
he intervened in the nick of time civilly and obsequiously persuading mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov not to give away cigars and rhine wine and above all money to the peasants as he had done before
he was very indignant too at the peasant girls drinking liqueur and eating sweets they re a lousy lot dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he said
i give them a kick every one of them and they take it as an honor that all they re worth
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov remembered andrey again and ordered punch to be sent out to him i was rude to him just now he repeated with a sinking softened voice
pyotr_fomitch_kalganov did not want to drink and at first did not care for the girls singing but after he had drunk a couple of glasses of champagne
he became extraordinarily lively strolling about the room laughing and praising the music and the songs admiring every one and everything
maximov blissfully drunk never left his side grushenka too was beginning to get drunk pointing to pyotr_fomitch_kalganov she said to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov what a dear charming boy he is
and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov delighted ran to kiss pyotr_fomitch_kalganov and maximov oh great were his hopes she had said nothing yet and seemed indeed purposely to refrain from speaking
but she looked at him from time to time with caressing and passionate eye at last she suddenly gripped his hand and drew him vigorously to her
she was sitting at the moment in the low chair by the door how was it you came just now eh
have you walked in i was frightened so you wanted to give me up to him did you did you really want to
i didnt want to spoil your happiness mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov faltered blissfully but she did not need his answer well go and enjoy yourself
he would run away and she listened to the singing and looked at the dancing though her eye followed him wherever he went
but in another quarter of an hour she would call him once more and again he would run back to her
she sent him away once more dont cry i ll call you back again come sit beside me tell me how did you hear about me and my coming here yesterday
from whom did you first hear it and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began telling her all about it disconnectedly incoherently feverishly he spoke strangely often frowning and stopping abruptly
what are you frowning at she asked nothing i left a man ill there i give ten years of my life for him to get well to know he was all right
well never mind him if he ill so you meant to shoot yourself to morrow what a silly boy what for
i like such reckless fellows as you she lisped with a rather halting tongue so you would go any length for me eh
did you really mean to shoot yourself to morrow you stupid no wait a little to morrow i may have something to say to you
i wont say it to day but to morrow you like it to be to day no i dont want to to day come go along now go and amuse yourself
once however she called him as it were puzzled and uneasy why are you sad i see you re sad
yes i see it she added looking intently into his eye though you keep kissing the peasants and shouting i see something
no be merry i merry you be merry too i love somebody here guess who it is ah look my boy has fallen asleep poor dear he drunk
she meant pyotr_fomitch_kalganov he was in fact drunk and had dropped asleep for a moment sitting on the sofa but he was not merely drowsy from drink he felt suddenly dejected or as he said bored
he was intensely depressed by the girls songs which as the drinking went on gradually became coarse and more reckless
two girls dressed up as bears and a lively girl called stepanida with a stick in her hand acted the part of keeper and began to show them
the bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion amid roars of laughter from the closely packed crowd of man and women
and the dances were as bad look alive marya_kondratyevna or you ll get the stick well let them let them said grushenka sententiously with an ecstatic expression on her face
when they do get a day to enjoy themselves why shouldnt folks be happy pyotr_fomitch_kalganov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt
it swinish all this peasant foolery he murmured moving away it the game they play when it light all night in summer
it described how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls to see whether they would love him the master came to try the girls would they love him would they not
he particularly disliked one new song to a jaunty dance tune but the girls could not love the master he would beat me cruelly and such love wont do for me
then a gypsy comes along and he too tries the gypsy came to try the girls would they love him would they not
but they couldnt love the gypsy either he would be a thief i fear and would cause me many a tear
and many more man come to try their luck among them a soldier the soldier came to try the girls would they love him would they not
but the soldier is rejected with contempt in two indecent lines sung with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience
the song ends with a merchant the merchant came to try the girls would they love him would they not and it appears that he wins their love because the merchant will make gold for me
and his queen i ll gladly be kalvanov was positively indignant that just a song of yesterday he said aloud
they might just as well have had a railwayman or a jew come to try his luck with the girls they have carried all before them
and almost as though it were a personal affront he declared on the spot that he was bored sat down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep
who writes such things for them his pretty little face looked rather pale as it fell back on the sofa cushion
look how pretty he is said grushenka taking mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov up to him i was combing his hair just now his hair like flax and so thick
and bending over him tenderly she kissed his forehead pyotr_fomitch_kalganov instantly opened his eye looked at her stood up and with the most anxious air inquired where was maximov
so that who it is you want grushenka laughed stay with me a minute mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov run and find his maximov
maximov it appeared could not tear himself away from the girls only running away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur
he had drunk two cups of chocolate his face was red and his nose was crimson his eye were moist and mawkishly sweet
he ran up and announced that he was going to dance the sabotičre they taught me all those well bred aristocratic dances when i was little
no no i coming to look on too exclaimed pyotr_fomitch_kalganov brushing aside in the most naďve way grushenka offer to sit with him
go go with him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and i ll watch from here how he dances said grushenka they all went to look on
it consisted of nothing but skipping and hopping kicking up the feet and at every skip maximov slapped the upturned sole of his foot
maximov danced his dance but it roused no great admiration in any one but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov pyotr_fomitch_kalganov did not like it at all but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kissed the dancer
thanks you re tired perhaps what are you looking for here would you like some sweets a cigar perhaps a cigarette
dont you want a drink i ll just have a liqueur have you any chocolates yes there a heap of them on the table there
choose one my dear soul i like one with vanilla for old people he he no brother we ve none of that special sort
i say the old man bent down to whisper in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ear that girl there little marya_kondratyevna he he
how would it be if you were to help me make friends with her so that what you re after no brother that wont do
i do no harm to any one maximov muttered disconsolately oh all right all right they only come here to dance and sing you know brother
but damn it all wait a bit eat and drink and be merry meanwhile dont you want money later on perhaps smiled maximov
all right all right mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov head was burning he went outside to the wooden balcony which ran round the whole building on the inner side overlooking the courtyard
the fresh air revived him he stood alone in a dark corner and suddenly clutched his head in both hands his scattered thoughts came together his sensations blended into a whole and threw a sudden light into his mind
a fearful and terrible light if i to shoot myself why not now passed through his mind why not go for the pistol bring them here and here in this dark dirty corner make an end
a few hours earlier when he had been dashing here he was pursued by disgrace by the theft he had committed and that blood that blood
almost a minute he stood undecided but yet it was easier for him then then everything was over he had lost her given her up
oh then his death sentence had been easier for him at least it had seemed necessary inevitable for what had he to stay on earth for
now one phantom one terror at least was at an end that first rightful lover that fateful figure had vanished leaving no trace
the terrible phantom had turned into something so small so comic it had been carried into the bedroom and locked in
she was gone for him but now was it the same as then it would never return she was ashamed and from her eye he could see now whom she loved
now he had everything to make life happy but he could not go on living he could not oh damnation
god restore to life the man i knocked down at the fence let this fearful cup pass from me
lord thou hast wrought miracles for such sinners as me but what what if the old man alive oh then the shame of the other disgrace i would wipe away
i would restore the stolen money i give it back i get it somehow no trace of that shame will remain except in my heart for ever
but no no oh impossible cowardly dreams oh damnation yet there was a ray of light and hope in his darkness
he jumped up and ran back to the room to her to her his queen for ever was not one moment of her love worth all the rest of life even in the agonies of disgrace
to her to her alone to see her to hear her to think of nothing to forget everything if only for that night for an hour for a moment
this wild question clutched at his heart just as he turned from the balcony into the passage he came upon the landlord trifon_borissovitch
he thought he looked gloomy and worried and fancied he had come to find him what is it trifon_borissovitch are you looking for me
no sir the landlord seemed disconcerted why should i be looking for you where have you been why do you look so glum
you re not angry are you wait a bit you shall soon get to bed what the time it ll be three clock
past three it must be we ll leave off soon we ll leave off dont mention it it doesnt matter keep it up as long as you like
what the matter with him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov wondered for an instant and he ran back to the room where the girls were dancing
but she was not there she was not in the blue room either there was no one but pyotr_fomitch_kalganov asleep on the sofa
bent forward with her head and arms on the bed close by she was crying bitterly doing her utmost to stifle her sobs that she might not be heard
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov peeped behind the curtain she was there she was sitting in the corner on a trunk seeing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov she beckoned him to her and when he ran to her she grasped his hand tightly
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mitya i loved him you know how i have loved him these five years all that time did i love him or only my own anger
no him him it a lie that it was my anger i loved and not him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i was only seventeen then he was so kind to me so merry he used to sing to me
or so it seemed to a silly girl like me and now lord it not the same man even his face is not the same he different altogether
i drove here with timofey and all the way i was thinking how i should meet him what i should say to him how we should look at one another
my soul was faint and all of a sudden it was just as though he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me
he talked to me like a schoolmaster all so grave and learned he met me so solemnly that i was struck dumb
i shouldnt have known him i couldnt get a word in at first i thought he was ashamed to talk before his great big pole
i sat staring at him and wondering why i couldnt say a word to him now it must have been his wife that ruined him you know he threw me up to get married
she must have changed him like that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov how shameful it is oh mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i ashamed i ashamed for all my life
curse it curse it curse those five years and again she burst into tears but clung tight to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hand and did not let it go
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov darling stay dont go away i want to say one word to you she whispered and suddenly raised her face to him
listen tell me who it is i love i love one man here who is that man that what you must tell me
a smile lighted up her face that was swollen with weeping and her eye shone in the half darkness
a falcon flew in and my heart sank fool that the man you love that was what my heart whispered to me at once
you came in and all grew bright what he afraid of i wondered for you were frightened you couldnt speak it not them
so fenya told you you little stupid how i called to alyosha_karamazov out of the window that i loved mityenka for one hour and that i was going now to love another
he afraid of could you be frightened of any one it me he afraid of i thought only me mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mitya how could i be such a fool as to think i could love any one after you
do you forgive me mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov do you forgive me or not do you love me do you love me she jumped up and held him with both hands on his shoulders
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov dumb with rapture gazed into her eye at her face at her smile and suddenly clasped her tightly in his arms and kissed her passionately
you will forgive me for having tormented you it was through spite i tormented you all it was for spite i drove the old man out of his mind
do you remember how you drank at my house one day and broke the wine glass i remembered that and i broke a glass to day and drank to my vile heart
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov my falcon why dont you kiss me he kissed me once and now he draws back and looks and listens
why listen to me kiss me kiss me hard that right if you love well then love i ll be your slave now your slave for the rest of my life
it sweet to be a slave kiss me beat me ill treat me do what you will with me and i do deserve to suffer
go along mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i ll come and have some wine i want to be drunk i going to get drunk and dance i must i must
stay wait afterwards i wont have that she suddenly thrust him away she tore herself away from him and disappeared behind the curtain
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov followed like a drunken man yes come what may whatever may happen now for one minute i give the whole world he thought
grushenka did in fact toss off a whole glass of champagne at one gulp and became at once very tipsy she sat down in the same chair as before with a blissful smile on her face
her cheeks were glowing her lips were burning her flashing eye were moist there was passionate appeal in her eye even pyotr_fomitch_kalganov felt a stir at the heart and went up to her
did you feel how i kissed you when you were asleep just now she said thickly i drunk now that what it is
and arent you drunk and why isnt mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov drinking why dont you drink mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i drunk and you dont drink i am drunk
i drunk as it is drunk with you and now i ll be drunk with wine too he drank off another glass and he thought it strange himself
that glass made him completely drunk he was suddenly drunk although till that moment he had been quite sober he remembered that
from that moment everything whirled about him as though he were delirious he walked laughed talked to everybody without knowing what he was doing
only one persistent burning sensation made itself felt continually like a red hot coal in his heart he said afterwards he went up to her sat beside her gazed at her listened to her
she became very talkative kept calling every one to her and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus when the girl came up she either kissed her or made the sign of the cross over her
he ran up every minute to kiss her hands each little finger and finally he danced another dance to an old song which he sang himself
in another minute she might have cried she was greatly amused by the little old man as she called maximov he danced with special vigor to the refrain the little pig says umph
umph umph the little calf says moo moo moo the little duck says quack quack quack the little goose says ga ga ga the hen goes strutting through the porch troo roo roo roo roo she ll say
troo roo roo roo roo she ll say give him something mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov said grushenka give him a present he poor you know ah the poor the insulted
do you know mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i shall go into a nunnery no i really shall one day alyosha_karamazov said something to me to day that i shall remember all my life
yes but to day let us dance to morrow to the nunnery but to day we ll dance i want to play to day good people and what of it
god will forgive us if i were god i forgive every one my dear sinners from this day forth i forgive you

come tell me i ve something to ask you come here every one and i ll ask you why am i so good
you know i am good i very good come why am i so good so grushenka babbled on getting more and more drunk
at last she announced that she was going to dance too she got up from her chair staggering mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov dont give me any more wine if i ask you dont give it to me
wine doesnt give peace everything going round the stove and everything i want to dance let every one see how i dance let them see how beautifully i dance
she pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of her pocket and took it by one corner in her right hand to wave it in the dance
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ran to and fro the girls were quiet and got ready to break into a dancing song at the first signal
maximov hearing that grushenka wanted to dance squealed with delight and ran skipping about in front of her humming with legs so slim and sides so trim and its little tail curled tight
she really meant it but grushenka waved her handkerchief at him and drove him away sh mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov why dont they come
let every one come to look on call them in too that were locked in why did you lock them in
tell them i going to dance let them look on too mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door and began knocking to the poles with his fist
hi you podvysotskys come she going to dance she calls you lajdak one of the poles shouted in reply
you re a lajdak yourself you re a little scoundrel that what you are leave off laughing at poland said pyotr_fomitch_kalganov sententiously
he too was drunk be quiet boy if i call him a scoundrel it doesnt mean that i called all poland so
one lajdak doesnt make a poland be quiet my pretty boy eat a sweetmeat ach what fellows as though they were not man
why wont they make friends said grushenka and went forward to dance the chorus broke into ah my porch my new porch
grushenka flung back her head half opened her lips smiled waved her handkerchief and suddenly with a violent lurch stood still in the middle of the room looking bewildered
i weak she said in an exhausted voice forgive me i weak i cant i sorry she bowed to the chorus and then began bowing in all directions
i sorry forgive me the lady been drinking the pretty lady has been drinking voices were heard saying
the lady drunk too much maximov explained to the girls giggling mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov lead me away take me said grushenka helplessly
well now i ll go thought pyotr_fomitch_kalganov and walking out of the blue room he closed the two halves of the door after him
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov pounced on her snatched her up in his arms and carried the precious burden through the curtains but the orgy in the larger room went on and grew louder and louder
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov laid grushenka on the bed and kissed her on the lips dont touch me she faltered in an imploring voice
dont touch me till i yours i ve told you i yours but dont touch me spare me with them here with them close you mustnt
he here it nasty here i ll obey you i wont think of it i worship you muttered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
yes it nasty here it abominable and still holding her in his arms he sank on his knees by the bedside
it must be honorable it shall be honorable for the future and let us be honest let us be good not brutes but good take me away take me far away do you hear
i know though you re a brute you re generous grushenka articulated with difficulty i dont want it to be here but far far away
oh yes yes it must be said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov pressing her in his arms i ll take you and we ll fly away
oh i give my whole life for one year only to know about that blood what blood asked grushenka bewildered
nothing muttered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov through his teeth grusha you wanted to be honest but i a thief but i ve stolen money from katya
disgrace a disgrace from katya from that young lady no you didnt steal it give it her back take it from me
why make a fuss now everything of mine is yours what does money matter we shall waste it anyway folks like us are bound to waste money
but we better go and work the land i want to dig the earth with my own hands we must work do you hear
alyosha_karamazov said so i wont be your mistress i ll be faithful to you i ll be your slave i ll work for you
we ll go to the young lady and bow down to her together so that she may forgive us and then we ll go away
and if she wont forgive us we ll go anyway take her her money and love me dont love her dont love her any more
if you love her i shall strangle her i ll put out both her eye with a needle i love you i love only you
i ll love you in siberia why siberia never mind siberia if you like i dont care we ll work there snow in siberia
i love driving in the snow and must have bells do you hear there a bell ringing where is that bell ringing
there are people coming now it stopped she closed her eye exhausted and suddenly fell asleep for an instant there had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance but the ringing had ceased
he did not notice that the bell had ceased ringing nor did he notice that the songs had ceased and that instead of singing and drunken clamor there was absolute stillness in the house
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov let his head sink on her breast grushenka opened her eye what the matter was i asleep yes a bell
i ve been asleep and dreamt i was driving over the snow with bells and i dozed i was with some one i loved with you
and far far away i was holding you and kissing you nestling close to you i was cold and the snow glistened
you know how the snow glistens at night when the moon shines it was as though i was not on earth
i woke up and my dear one is close to me how sweet that is close to you murmured mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kissing her dress her bosom her hands
and suddenly he had a strange fancy it seemed to him that she was looking straight before her not at him not into his face but over his head with an intent almost uncanny fixity
an expression of wonder almost of alarm came suddenly into her face mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov who is that looking at us she whispered
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov turned and saw that some one had in fact parted the curtains and seemed to be watching them and not one person alone it seemed
he jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder here come to us come here said a voice speaking not loudly but firmly and peremptorily
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still the room was filled with people but not those who had been there before
an instantaneous shiver ran down his back and he shuddered he recognized all those people instantly that tall stout old man in the overcoat and forage cap with a cockade was the police captain mihail_makarovitch
and that consumptive looking trim dandy who always has such polished boots that was the deputy prosecutor he has a chronometer worth four hundred roubles he showed it to me
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov forgot his surname though he knew him had seen him he was the investigating lawyer from the school of jurisprudence who had only lately come to the town
and that small young man in spectacles and this man the inspector of police mavriky_mavrikyevitch a man he knew well
and those fellows with the brass plates on why are they here and those other two peasants and there at the door pyotr_fomitch_kalganov with trifon_borissovitch gentlemen
what this for gentlemen began mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov but suddenly as though beside himself not knowing what he was doing he cried aloud at the top of his voice
the young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly and stepping up to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began with dignity though hurriedly we have to make in brief i beg you to come this way this way to the sofa
i un der stand it is absolutely imperative that you should give an explanation the old man cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov frantically the old man and his blood
i understand and he sank almost fell on a chair close by as though he had been mown down by a scythe
you understand he understands it monster and parricide your father_zossima blood cries out against you the old captain of police roared suddenly stepping up to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
he was beside himself crimson in the face and quivering all over this is impossible cried the small young man
mihail_makarovitch mihail_makarovitch makarovitch this wont do i beg you ll allow me to speak i should never have expected such behavior from you
this is delirium gentlemen raving delirium cried the captain of police look at him drunk at this time of night in the company of a disreputable woman with the blood of his father_zossima on his hands
i beg you most earnestly dear mihail_makarovitch to restrain your feeling the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old police captain or i shall be forced to resort to
it delirium but the little lawyer did not allow him to finish he turned to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and delivered himself in a loud firm dignified voice
ex lieutenant alyosha_karamazov it is my duty to inform you that you are charged with the murder of your father_zossima fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov perpetrated this night
he said something more and the prosecutor too put in something but though mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov heard them he did not understand them
the beginning of pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin official career pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin whom we left knocking at the strong locked gates of the widow morozov house ended of course by making himself heard
fenya who was still excited by the fright she had had two hours before and too much upset to go to bed was almost frightened into hysterics on hearing the furious knocking at the gate
though she had herself seen him drive away she fancied that it must be dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knocking again no one else could knock so savagely
she ran to the house porter who had already waked up and gone out to the gate and began imploring him not to open it
but having questioned pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin and learned that he wanted to see fenya on very important business the man made up his mind at last to open
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin was admitted into fenya kitchen but the girl begged him to allow the house porter to be present because of her misgivings
he began questioning her and at once learnt the most vital fact that is that when dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had run out to look for grushenka he had snatched up a pestle from the mortar and that when he returned the pestle was not with him and his hands were smeared with blood
he stared at them all with wild eye book ix the preliminary investigation chapter i and the blood was simply flowing dripping from him dripping
fenya kept exclaiming this horrible detail was simply the product of her disordered imagination but although not dripping pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin had himself seen those hands stained with blood and had helped to wash them
moreover the question he had to decide was not how soon the blood had dried but where dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had run with the pestle or rather whether it really was to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and how he could satisfactorily ascertain
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin persisted in returning to this point and though he found out nothing conclusive yet he carried away a conviction that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov could have gone nowhere but to his father_zossima house and that therefore something must have happened there
and when he came back fenya added with excitement i told him the whole story and then i began asking him why have you got blood on your hands dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and he answered that that was human blood and that he had just killed some one
he confessed it all to me and suddenly ran off like a madman i sat down and began thinking where he run off to now like a madman
he ll go to mokroe i thought and kill my mistress there i ran out to beg him not to kill her
i was running to his lodgings but i looked at plotnikov shop and saw him just setting off and there was no blood on his hands then
after asking some further questions pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin left the house even more upset and uneasy than he had been when he entered it
the most direct and the easiest thing for him to do would have been to go straight to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov to find out whether anything had happened there and if so what and only to go to the police captain as pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin firmly intended doing when he had satisfied himself of the fact
fenya had noticed this and remembered it fenya old grandmother confirmed her evidence as far as she was capable but the night was dark fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov gates were strong and he would have to knock again
his acquaintance with fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was of the slightest and what if after he had been knocking they opened to him and nothing had happened
then fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in his jeering way would go telling the story all over the town how a stranger called pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin had broken in upon him at midnight to ask if any one had killed him
yet the feeling that possessed him was so strong that though he stamped his foot angrily and swore at himself he set off again not to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov but to madame_hohlakov
he decided that if she denied having just given dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov three thousand roubles he would go straight to the police captain but if she admitted having given him the money he would go home and let the matter rest till next morning
it is of course perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood of causing scandal by going at eleven clock at night to a fashionable lady a complete stranger and perhaps rousing her from her bed to ask her an amazing question than by going to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
but that is just how it is sometimes especially in cases like the present one with the decisions of the most precise and phlegmatic people
it would make a scandal and scandal was what pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin dreaded more than anything in the world pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin was by no means phlegmatic at that moment
he remembered all his life how a haunting uneasiness gradually gained possession of him growing more and more painful and driving him on against his will
yet he kept cursing himself of course all the way for going to this lady but i will get to the bottom of it i will
he repeated for the tenth time grinding his teeth and he carried out his intention it was exactly eleven clock when he entered madame_hohlakov house
he was admitted into the yard pretty quickly but in response to his inquiry whether the lady was still up the porter could give no answer except that she was usually in bed by that time
ask at the top of the stairs if the lady wants to receive you she ll receive you if she wont she wont
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin went up but did not find things so easy here the footman was unwilling to take in his name but finally called a maid
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin politely but insistently begged her to inform her lady that an official living in the town called pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin had called on particular business and that if it were not of the greatest importance he would not have ventured to come
tell her in those words in those words exactly he asked the girl she went away he remained waiting in the entry
she had felt upset ever since mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov visit and had a presentiment that she would not get through the night without the sick headache which always with her followed such excitement
madame_hohlakov herself was already in her bedroom though not yet asleep she was surprised on hearing the announcement from the maid
she irritably declined to see him however though the unexpected visit at such an hour of an official living in the town who was a total stranger roused her feminine curiosity intensely
he begged the maid most earnestly to take another message in these very words that he had come on business of the greatest importance and that madame_hohlakov might have cause to regret it later if she refused to see him now
but this time pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin was as obstinate as a mule i plunged headlong he described it afterwards the maid gazing at him in amazement went to take his message again
she thought a little asked what he looked like and learned that he was very well dressed young and so polite
madame_hohlakov was impressed we may note parenthetically that pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin was a rather good looking young man and well aware of the fact
madame_hohlakov made up her mind to see him she was in her dressing gown and slippers but she flung a black shawl over her shoulders
the official was asked to walk into the drawing room the very room in which mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had been received shortly before
the lady came to meet her visitor with a sternly inquiring countenance and without asking him to sit down began at once with the question what do you want
i have ventured to disturb you madam on a matter concerning our common acquaintance dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin began but he had hardly uttered the name when the lady face showed signs of acute irritation
she almost shrieked and interrupted him in a fury how much longer am i to be worried by that awful man
how dare you sir how could you venture to disturb a lady who is a stranger to you in her own house at such an hour
and to force yourself upon her to talk of a man who came here to this very drawing room only three hours ago to murder me and went stamping out of the room as no one would go out of a decent house
she cried hysterically let me tell you sir that i shall lodge a complaint against you that i will not let it pass
kindly leave me at once i am a mother i i murder then he tried to murder you too
if you would kindly listen madam for half a moment i ll explain it all in a couple of words answered pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin firmly
at five clock this afternoon dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov borrowed ten roubles from me and i know for a fact he had no money
yet at nine clock he came to see me with a bundle of hundred rouble notes in his hand about two or three thousand roubles
why has he killed somebody else madame_hohlakov asked impulsively his hands and face were all covered with blood and he looked like a madman
when i asked him where he had got so much money he answered that he had just received it from you that you had given him a sum of three thousand to go to the gold mines
madame_hohlakov face assumed an expression of intense and painful excitement good god he must have killed his old father_zossima
she cried clasping her hands i have never given him money never oh run run dont say another word
save the old man run to his father_zossima run excuse me madam then you did not give him money
you remember for a fact that you did not give him any money no i didnt i didnt i refused to give it him for he could not appreciate it
he ran out in a fury stamping he rushed at me but i slipped away and let me tell you as i wish to hide nothing from you now that he positively spat at me
can you fancy that but why are we standing ah sit down excuse me i or better run run you must run and save the poor old man from an awful death
but if he has killed him already ah good heavens yes then what are we to do now what do you think we must do now
briefly but fairly clearly pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin told her the history of the affair that part of it at least which he had himself witnessed
meantime she had made pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin sit down and sat down herself facing him he described too his visit to fenya and told her about the pestle
all these details produced an overwhelming effect on the distracted lady who kept uttering shrieks and covering her face with her hands
would you believe it i foresaw all this i have that special faculty whatever i imagine comes to pass and how often i ve looked at that awful man and always thought that man will end by murdering me
if he hasnt murdered me but only his own father_zossima it only because the finger of god preserved me and what more he was ashamed to murder me because in this very place i put the holy ikon from the relics of the holy martyr saint varvara on his neck
and to think how near i was to death at that minute i went close up to him and he stretched out his neck to me
do you know pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin i think you said your name was pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin i dont believe in miracles but that ikon and this unmistakable miracle with me now that shakes me and i ready to believe in anything you like
but i dont know what i saying and only fancy with the ikon on his neck he spat at me
and now it happened that is have you heard about father_zossima he only spat it true he didnt murder me and he dashed away
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin got up and announced that he was going straight to the police captain to tell him all about it and leave him to do what he thought fit
but what shall we do what must we do now what do you think oh he an excellent man excellent
mihail_makarovitch i know him of course he the person to go to how practical you are pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin how well you ve thought of everything
especially as i know the police captain very well too observed pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin who still continued to stand and was obviously anxious to escape as quickly as possible from the impulsive lady who would not let him say good by and go away
and be sure be sure she prattled on to come back and tell me what you see there and what you find out what comes to light how they ll try him and what he condemned to
i should never have thought of it in your place tell me we have no capital punishment have we but be sure to come even if it at three clock at night at four at half past four
tell them to wake me to wake me to shake me if i dont get up but good heavens i shant sleep
but if you would write three lines with your own hand stating that you did not give dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov money it might perhaps be of use
but wait hadnt i better come with you no in case it needed to be sure madame_hohlakov skipped delighted to her bureau
and you know i simply struck amazed at your resourcefulness your good sense in such affairs are you in the service here
i delighted to think that you re in the service here and still speaking she scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper the following lines
i ve never in my life lent to that unhappy man dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov for in spite of all he is unhappy three thousand roubles to day
i ve never given him money never that i swear by all that holy hohlakov here the note she turned quickly to pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin
go save him it a noble deed on your part and she made the sign of the cross three time over him
she ran out to accompany him to the passage how grateful i am to you you cant think how grateful i am to you for having come to me first
how is it i havent met you before i shall feel flattered at seeing you at my house in the future
how delightful it is that you are living here such precision such practical ability they must appreciate you they must understand you
if there anything i can do believe me oh i love young people i in love with young people the younger generation are the one prop of our suffering country
her one hope oh go go but pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin had already run away or she would not have let him go so soon
yet madame_hohlakov had made a rather agreeable impression on him which had somewhat softened his anxiety at being drawn into such an unpleasant affair
she by no means so elderly he thought feeling pleased on the contrary i should have taken her for her daughter
tastes differ as we all know as for madame_hohlakov she was simply enchanted by the young man
such sense such exactness in so young a man in our day and all that with such manners and appearance people say the young people of to day are no good for anything but here an example
so she simply forgot this dreadful affair and it was only as she was getting into bed that suddenly recalling how near death she had been she exclaimed ah it is awful awful
i would not however have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant details if this eccentric meeting of the young official with the by no means elderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the foundation of the whole career of that practical and precise young man
his story is remembered to this day with amazement in our town and i shall perhaps have something to say about it when i have finished my long history of the brothers alyosha_karamazov
etc but she fell at once into a sound sweet sleep chapter ii the alarm our police captain mihail_makarovitch makarov a retired lieutenant colonel was a widower and an excellent man
he had only come to us three years previously but had won general esteem chiefly because he knew how to keep society together
he was never without visitors and could not have got on without them some one or other was always dining with him he never sat down to table without guests
he gave regular dinners too on all sort of occasions sometimes most surprising ones though the fare was not recherché it was abundant
the first room his guests entered was a well fitted billiard room with pictures of english race horses in black frames on the walls an essential decoration as we all know for a bachelor billiard room
the fish pies were excellent and the wine made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality there was card playing every evening at his house if only at one table
but at frequent interval all the society of our town with the mammas and young lady assembled at his house to dance
though mihail_makarovitch was a widower he did not live alone his widowed daughter lived with him with her two unmarried daughters grown up girls who had finished their education
they were of agreeable appearance and lively character and though every one knew they would have no dowry they attracted all the young man of fashion to their grandfather house
mihail_makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his work though he performed his duties no worse than many others
to speak plainly he was a man of rather narrow education his understanding of the limits of his administrative power could not always be relied upon
it was not so much that he failed to grasp certain reforms enacted during the present reign as that he made conspicuous blunders in his interpretation of them
this was not from any special lack of intelligence but from carelessness for he was always in too great a hurry to go into the subject
he had not even formed a definite idea of the fundamental principles of the reforms connected with the emancipation of the serfs and only picked it up so to speak from year to year involuntarily increasing his knowledge by practice
i have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian he used to say of himself and yet he was himself a landowner
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin knew for certain that he would meet some of mihail_makarovitch visitors there that evening but he didnt know which
as it happened at that moment the prosecutor and varvinsky our district doctor a young man who had only just come to us from petersburg after taking a brilliant degree at the academy of medicine were playing whist at the police captain
ippolit_kirillovitch the prosecutor he was really the deputy prosecutor but we always called him the prosecutor was rather a peculiar man of about five and thirty inclined to be consumptive and married to a fat and childless woman
it seemed that all that was wrong with him was that he had a better opinion of himself than his ability warranted
he was vain and irritable though he had a good intellect and even a kind heart and that made him seem constantly uneasy
he had moreover certain higher even artistic leanings towards psychology for instance a special study of the human heart a special knowledge of the criminal and his crime
he cherished a grievance on this ground considering that he had been passed over in the service and being firmly persuaded that in higher spheres he had not been properly appreciated and had enemies
in gloomy moments he even threatened to give up his post and practice as a barrister in criminal cases the unexpected alyosha_karamazov case agitated him profoundly
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov the young investigating lawyer who had only come from petersburg two months before was sitting in the next room with the young lady
people talked about it afterwards and wondered that all the gentlemen should as though intentionally on the evening of the crime have been gathered together at the house of the executive authority
it was a case that might well be talked about all over russia but i am anticipating yet it was perfectly simple and happened quite naturally
ippolit_kirillovitch wife had had toothache for the last two day and he was obliged to go out to escape from her groans
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov had been intending for three day past to drop in that evening at mihail_makarovitch so to speak casually so as slyly to startle the eldest granddaughter olga mihailovna by showing that he knew her secret that he knew it was her birthday and that she was trying to conceal it on purpose so as not to be obliged to give a dance
he anticipated a great deal of merriment many playful jests about her age and her being afraid to reveal it about his knowing her secret and telling everybody and so on
the charming young man was a great adept at such teasing the lady had christened him the naughty man and he seemed to be delighted at the name
he was extremely well bred however of good family education and feeling and though leading a life of pleasure his sallies were always innocent and in good taste
the doctor from the very nature of his being could not spend an evening except at cards he was short and delicate looking
when he was engaged in his official duties he always became extraordinarily grave as though realizing his position and the sanctity of the obligations laid upon him
he had a special gift for mystifying murderers and other criminals of the peasant class during interrogation and if he did not win their respect he certainly succeeded in arousing their wonder
on his white slender little fingers he always wore a number of big glittering rings pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin was simply dumbfounded when he went into the police captain
he saw instantly that every one knew they had positively thrown down their cards all were standing up and talking even nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov had left the young lady and run in looking strenuous and ready for action
pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin was met with the astounding news that old fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov really had been murdered that evening in his own house murdered and robbed
marfa_ignatyevna the wife of old grigory_vassilyevitch who had been knocked senseless near the fence was sleeping soundly in her bed and might well have slept till morning after the draught she had taken
but all of a sudden she waked up no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic scream from smerdyakov who was lying in the next room unconscious
the news had only just reached them in the following manner that scream always preceded his fits and always terrified and upset marfa_ignatyevna
she could never get accustomed to it she jumped up and ran half awake to smerdyakov room but it was dark there and she could only hear the invalid beginning to gasp and struggle
then marfa_ignatyevna herself screamed out and was going to call her husband but suddenly realized that when she had got up he was not beside her in bed
she ran back to the bedstead and began groping with her hands but the bed was really empty then he must have gone out where
she got no answer of course but she caught the sound of groans far away in the garden in the darkness
she ran to the steps and timidly called him she listened the groans were repeated and it was evident they came from the garden
good lord just as it was with lizaveta smerdyastchaya she thought distractedly she went timidly down the steps and saw that the gate into the garden was open
he must be out there poor dear she thought she went up to the gate and all at once she distinctly heard grigory_vassilyevitch calling her by name marfa
marfa in a weak moaning dreadful voice lord preserve us from harm marfa_ignatyevna murmured and ran towards the voice and that was how she found grigory_vassilyevitch
it appeared later that he had crawled away on coming to himself and probably had been a long time getting so far losing consciousness several time
but she found him not by the fence where he had been knocked down but about twenty paces off she noticed at once that he was covered with blood and screamed at the top of her voice
grigory_vassilyevitch was muttering incoherently he has murdered his father_zossima murdered why scream silly run fetch some one
but marfa continued screaming and seeing that her master window was open and that there was a candle alight in the window she ran there and began calling fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
but peeping in at the window she saw a fearful sight her master was lying on his back motionless on the floor
his light colored dressing gown and white shirt were soaked with blood the candle on the table brightly lighted up the blood and the motionless dead face of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
terror stricken marfa rushed away from the window ran out of the garden drew the bolt of the big gate and ran headlong by the back way to the neighbor marya_kondratyevna
both mother and daughter were asleep but they waked up at marfa desperate and persistent screaming and knocking at the shutter
marfa shrieking and screaming incoherently managed to tell them the main fact and to beg for assistance it happened that foma had come back from his wanderings and was staying the night with them
on the way marya_kondratyevna remembered that at about eight clock she heard a dreadful scream from their garden and this was no doubt grigory_vassilyevitch scream parricide
they got him up immediately and all three ran to the scene of the crime uttered when he caught hold of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov leg
some one person screamed out and then was silent marya_kondratyevna explained as she ran running to the place where grigory_vassilyevitch lay the two women with the help of foma carried him to the lodge
they lighted a candle and saw that smerdyakov was no better that he was writhing in convulsions his eye fixed in a squint and that foam was flowing from his lips
they moistened grigory_vassilyevitch forehead with water mixed with vinegar and the water revived him at once he asked immediately is the master murdered
then foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this time that not only the window but also the door into the garden was wide open though fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had for the last week locked himself in every night and did not allow even grigory_vassilyevitch to come in on any pretext
seeing that door open they were afraid to go in to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov for fear anything should happen afterwards and when they returned to grigory_vassilyevitch the old man told them to go straight to the police captain
she arrived only five minutes before pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin so that his story came not as his own surmise and theory but as the direct confirmation by a witness of the theory held by all as to the identity of the criminal a theory he had in the bottom of his heart refused to believe till that moment
marya_kondratyevna ran there and gave the alarm to the whole party at the police captain it was resolved to act with energy
the deputy police inspector of the town was commissioned to take four witnesses to enter fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov house and there to open an inquiry on the spot according to the regular forms which i will not go into here
the district doctor a zealous man new to his work almost insisted on accompanying the police captain the prosecutor and the investigating lawyer
i will note briefly that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was found to be quite dead with his skull battered in but with what
and immediately that weapon was found grigory_vassilyevitch to whom all possible medical assistance was at once given described in a weak and breaking voice how he had been knocked down
they began looking with a lantern by the fence and found the brass pestle dropped in a most conspicuous place on the garden path
most likely with the same weapon with which grigory_vassilyevitch had been attacked there were no signs of disturbance in the room where fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was lying
but by the bed behind the screen they picked up from the floor a big and thick envelope with the inscription a present of three thousand roubles for my angel grushenka if she is willing to come
there were three seals of red sealing wax on the envelope but it had been torn open and was empty the money had been removed
and below had been added by fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov for my little chicken they found also on the floor a piece of narrow pink ribbon with which the envelope had been tied up
one piece of pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin evidence made a great impression on the prosecutor and the investigating magistrate namely his idea that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov would shoot himself before daybreak that he had resolved to do so had spoken of it to pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin had taken the pistol loaded them before him written a letter put it in his pocket etc
when pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin though still unwilling to believe in it threatened to tell some one so as to prevent the suicide mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had answered grinning you ll be too late
so they must make haste to mokroe to find the criminal before he really did shoot himself that clear that clear
that just the way with mad fellows like that i shall kill myself to morrow so i ll make merry till i die
repeated the prosecutor in great excitement the story of how he had bought the wine and provisions excited the prosecutor more than ever
he stole fifteen hundred went at once to have his hair curled and then without even hiding the money carrying it almost in his hand in the same way he went off to the girls
do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called olsufyev gentlemen all were delayed however by the inquiry the search and the formalities etc in the house of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
it all took time and so two hours before starting they sent on ahead to mokroe the officer of the rural police mavriky_mavrikyevitch schmertsov who had arrived in the town the morning before to get his pay
he was instructed to avoid raising the alarm when he reached mokroe but to keep constant watch over the criminal till the arrival of the proper authorities to procure also witnesses for the arrest police constables and so on
mavriky_mavrikyevitch did as he was told preserving his incognito and giving no one but his old acquaintance trifon_borissovitch the slightest hint of his secret business
he had spoken to him just before mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov met the landlord in the balcony looking for him in the dark and noticed at once a change in trifon_borissovitch face and voice
so neither mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov nor any one else knew that he was being watched the box with the pistol had been carried off by trifon_borissovitch and put in a suitable place
only after four clock almost at sunrise all the officials the police captain the prosecutor the investigating lawyer drove up in two carriages each drawn by three horses
the doctor remained at fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov to make a post mortem next day on the body but he was particularly interested in the condition of the servant smerdyakov
such violent and protracted epileptic fits recurring continually for twenty four hours are rarely to be met with and are of interest to science he declared enthusiastically to his companions and as they left they laughingly congratulated him on his find
after these long but i think necessary explanations we will return to that moment of our tale at which we broke off
the prosecutor and the investigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctor saying that smerdyakov could not outlive the night chapter iii
the sufferings of a soul the first ordeal and so mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sat looking wildly at the people round him not understanding what was said to him
suddenly he got up flung up his hands and shouted aloud i not guilty i not guilty of that blood i not guilty of my father_zossima blood
but he had hardly said this before grushenka rushed from behind the curtain and flung herself at the police captain feet
i meant to kill him but i not guilty not i it was my fault mine my wickedness she cried in a heartrending voice bathed in tears stretching out her clasped hands towards them
he did it through me i tortured him and drove him to it i tortured that poor old man that dead too in my wickedness and brought him to this
it my fault mine first mine most my fault yes it your fault you re the chief criminal you fury you harlot
you re the most to blame shouted the police captain threatening her with his hand but he was quickly and resolutely suppressed
the prosecutor positively seized hold of him this is absolutely irregular mihail_makarovitch he cried you are positively hindering the inquiry
you re ruining the case he almost gasped follow the regular course follow the regular course cried nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov fearfully excited too otherwise it absolutely impossible
judge us together grushenka cried frantically still kneeling punish us together i will go with him now if it to death
grusha my life my blood my holy one mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov fell on his knees beside her and held her tight in his arms
he remembered afterwards that he was forcibly dragged away from her by several man and that she was led out and that when he recovered himself he was sitting at the table
dont believe her he cried she not guilty of anything of any blood of anything beside him and behind him stood the man with metal plates
facing him on the other side of the table sat nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov the investigating lawyer he kept persuading him to drink a little water out of a glass that stood on the table
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he remembered it afterwards became suddenly intensely interested in his big rings one with an amethyst and another with a transparent bright yellow stone of great brilliance
and long afterwards he remembered with wonder how those rings had riveted his attention through all those terrible hours of interrogation so that he was utterly unable to tear himself away from them and dismiss them as things that had nothing to do with his position
on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov left side in the place where maximov had been sitting at the beginning of the evening the prosecutor was now seated and on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov right hand where grushenka had been was a rosy cheeked young man in a sort of shabby hunting jacket with ink and paper before him
that will refresh you that will calm you be calm dont be frightened he added extremely politely this was the secretary of the investigating lawyer who had brought him with him
the police captain was now standing by the window at the other end of the room beside pyotr_fomitch_kalganov who was sitting there
drink some water said the investigating lawyer softly for the tenth time i have drunk it gentlemen i have
but come gentlemen crush me punish me decide my fate cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov staring with terribly fixed wide open eye at the investigating lawyer
so you positively declare that you are not guilty of the death of your father_zossima fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov asked the investigating lawyer softly but insistently
i am not guilty i am guilty of the blood of another old man but not of my father_zossima and i weep for it
but it hard to have to answer for that murder with another a terrible murder of which i am not guilty
i killed i killed the old man and knocked him down it a terrible accusation gentlemen a knock down blow but who has killed my father_zossima who has killed him
who can have killed him if i didnt it marvelous extraordinary impossible yes who can have killed him the investigating lawyer was beginning but ippolit_kirillovitch the prosecutor glancing at him addressed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
he is alive he has recovered and in spite of the terrible blows inflicted according to his own and your evidence by you there seems no doubt that he will live so the doctor says at least
you need not worry yourself about the old servant grigory_vassilyevitch alive he alive cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov flinging up his hands
his face beamed lord i thank thee for the miracle thou has wrought for me a sinner and evildoer that an answer to my prayer
i ve been praying all night and he crossed himself three time he was almost breathless so from this grigory_vassilyevitch we have received such important evidence concerning you that
the prosecutor would have continued but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly jumped up from his chair one minute gentlemen for god sake one minute i will run to her
excuse me at this moment it quite impossible nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov almost shrieked he too leapt to his feet mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was seized by the man with the metal plates but he sat down of his own accord
i wanted to see her for one minute only i wanted to tell her that it has been washed away it has gone that blood that was weighing on my heart all night and that i am not a murderer now
gentlemen what a pity gentlemen she is my betrothed he said ecstatically and reverently looking round at them all
oh thank you gentlemen oh in one minute you have given me new life new heart that old man used to carry me in his arms gentlemen
he used to wash me in the tub when i was a baby three years old abandoned by every one he was like a father_zossima to me
allow me gentlemen allow me one minute more interposed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov putting his elbows on the table and covering his face with his hands
and so you the investigating lawyer began let me have a moment to think let me breathe gentlemen all this is horribly upsetting horribly
a man is not a drum gentlemen drink a little more water murmured nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov took his hands from his face and laughed
his whole bearing was changed he was once more the equal of these man with all of whom he was acquainted as though they had all met the day before when nothing had happened at some social gathering
we may note in passing that on his first arrival mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had been made very welcome at the police captain but later during the last month especially mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had hardly called at all and when the police captain met him in the street for instance mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov noticed that he frowned and only bowed out of politeness
his acquaintance with the prosecutor was less intimate though he sometimes paid his wife a nervous and fanciful lady visits of politeness without quite knowing why and she always received him graciously and had for some reason taken an interest in him up to the last
he had not had time to get to know the investigating lawyer though he had met him and talked to him twice each time about the fair sex
his eye were confident he seemed completely transformed in a moment you re a most skillful lawyer i see nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov laughing gayly but i can help you now
oh gentlemen i feel like a new man and dont be offended at my addressing you so simply and directly i rather drunk too i ll tell you that frankly
i believe i ve had the honor and pleasure of meeting you nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov at my kinsman pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov gentlemen gentlemen i dont pretend to be on equal terms with you
i understand of course in what character i am sitting before you oh of course there a horrible suspicion hanging over me if grigory_vassilyevitch has given evidence
but to business gentlemen i am ready and we will make an end of it in one moment for listen listen gentlemen
a horrible suspicion it awful awful i understand that since i know i innocent we can put an end to it in a minute
cant we cant we mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov spoke much and quickly nervously and effusively as though he positively took his listeners to be his best friends
so for the present we will write that you absolutely deny the charge brought against you said nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov impressively and bending down to the secretary he dictated to him in an undertone what to write
write it down you want to write that down well write it i consent i give my full consent gentlemen only do you see
and there is something else at the bottom of my heart of which i am guilty too but that you need not write down he turned suddenly to the secretary that my personal life gentlemen that doesnt concern you the bottom of my heart that to say
stay stay write this of disorderly conduct i am guilty of violence on a poor old man i am guilty but of the murder of my old father_zossima i not guilty
that a wild idea it quite a wild idea i will prove you that and you ll be convinced directly you will laugh gentlemen
you ll laugh yourselves at your suspicion be calm dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said the investigating lawyer evidently trying to allay mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov excitement by his own composure
before we go on with our inquiry i should like if you will consent to answer to hear you confirm the statement that you disliked your father_zossima fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov that you were involved in continual disputes with him
here at least a quarter of an hour ago you exclaimed that you wanted to kill him i didnt kill him you said
but i wanted to kill him did i exclaim that ach that may be so gentlemen yes unhappily i did want to kill him
many time i wanted to unhappily unhappily you wanted to would you consent to explain what motives precisely led you to such a sentiment of hatred for your parent
what is there to explain gentlemen mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov shrugged his shoulders sullenly looking down i have never concealed my feeling
all the town knows about it every one knows in the tavern only lately i declared them in father_zossima cell and the very same day in the evening i beat my father_zossima
i nearly killed him and i swore i come again and kill him before witnesses oh a thousand witnesses i ve been shouting it aloud for the last month any one can tell you that
the fact stares you in the face it speaks for itself it cries aloud but feeling gentlemen feeling are another matter
i know that you are bound by your office i quite understand that but that my affair my private intimate affair yet since i havent concealed my feeling in the past in the tavern for instance i ve talked to every one
you see gentlemen mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov frowned it seems to me that about feeling you ve no right to question me so so i wont make a secret of it now
you see i understand gentlemen that there are terrible facts against me in this business i told every one that i kill him and now all of a sudden he been killed
so it must have been me ha ha i can make allowances for you gentlemen i can quite make allowances i struck all of a heap myself for who can have murdered him if not i_
that what it comes to isnt it if not i who can it be who gentlemen i want to know i insist on knowing
he exclaimed suddenly where was he murdered how was he murdered how and with what tell me he asked quickly looking at the two lawyers
we found him in his study lying on his back on the floor with his head battered in said the prosecutor
that horrible mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov shuddered and putting his elbows on the table hid his face in his right hand
we will continue interposed nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov so what was it that impelled you to this sentiment of hatred you have asserted in public i believe that it was based upon jealousy
well yes jealousy and not only jealousy disputes about money yes about money too there was a dispute about three thousand roubles i think which you claimed as part of your inheritance
three thousand more more cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hotly more than six thousand more than ten perhaps i told every one so shouted it at them
but i made up my mind to let it go at three thousand i was desperately in need of that three thousand
so the bundle of notes for three thousand that i knew he kept under his pillow ready for grushenka i considered as simply stolen from me
yes gentlemen i looked upon it as mine as my own property the prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer and had time to wink at him on the sly
you will allow us to note that point and write it down that you looked upon that money as your own property
i know that another fact that tells against me but i not afraid of facts and i tell them against myself
we will return to that subject later said the lawyer promptly write it down by all means do you hear
do you know gentlemen you take me for a different sort of man from what i am he added suddenly gloomy and dejected
you have to deal with a man of honor a man of the highest honor above all dont lose sight of it a man who done a lot of nasty things but has always been and still is honorable at bottom in his inner being
that i yearned to be honorable that i was so to say a martyr to a sense of honor seeking for it with a lantern with the lantern of diogenes and yet all my life
i dont know how to express it that just what made me wretched all my life i ve been doing filthy things like all of us gentlemen
that is like me alone that was a mistake like me alone me alone gentlemen my head aches his brows contracted with pain
you see gentlemen i couldnt bear the look of him there was something in him ignoble impudent trampling on everything sacred something sneering and irreverent loathsome loathsome
but now that he dead i feel differently how do you mean i dont feel differently but i wish i hadnt hated him so
you feel penitent no not penitent dont write that i not much good myself i not very beautiful so i had no right to consider him repulsive
that what i mean write that down if you like saying this mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov became very mournful he had grown more and more gloomy as the inquiry continued
though grushenka had been removed she had not been taken far away only into the room next but one from the blue room in which the examination was proceeding
it was a little room with one window next beyond the large room in which they had danced and feasted so lavishly
at that moment another unexpected scene followed she was sitting there with no one by her but maximov who was terribly depressed terribly scared and clung to her side as though for security
at their door stood one of the peasants with a metal plate on his breast grushenka was crying and suddenly her grief was too much for her
she jumped up flung up her arms and with a loud wail of sorrow rushed out of the room to him to her mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and so unexpectedly that they had not time to stop her
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hearing her cry trembled jumped up and with a yell rushed impetuously to meet her not knowing what he was doing
but they were not allowed to come together though they saw one another he was seized by the arms he struggled and tried to tear himself away
she was seized too and he saw her stretching out her arms to him crying aloud as they carried her away
when the scene was over he came to himself again sitting in the same place as before opposite the investigating lawyer and crying out to them what do you want with her
it took three or four man to hold him why do you torment her she done nothing nothing the lawyers tried to soothe him
at last mihail_makarovitch who had been absent came hurriedly into the room and said in a loud and excited voice to the prosecutor she been removed she downstairs
about ten minutes passed like this will you allow me to say one word to this unhappy man gentlemen in your presence gentlemen in your presence
listen dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov my dear fellow began the police captain and there was a look of warm almost fatherly feeling for the luckless prisoner on his excited face
by all means mihail_makarovitch answered the investigating lawyer in the present case we have nothing against it
i took your agrafena_alexandrovna downstairs myself and confided her to the care of the landlord daughters and that old fellow maximov is with her all the time
i impressed on her that you have to clear yourself so she mustnt hinder you must not depress you or you may lose your head and say the wrong thing in your evidence
and i soothed her do you hear i soothed and calmed her in fact i talked to her and she understood
she a sensible girl my boy a good hearted girl she would have kissed my old hands begging help for you she sent me herself to tell you not to worry about her
and i must go my dear fellow i must go and tell her that you are calm and comforted about her
i was unfair to her she is a christian soul gentlemen yes i tell you she a gentle soul and not to blame for anything
and so you must be calm do you understand so what am i to tell her dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov will you sit quiet or not
the good natured police captain said a great deal that was irregular but grushenka suffering a fellow creature suffering touched his good natured heart and tears stood in his eye
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jumped up and rushed towards him forgive me gentlemen oh allow me allow me he cried
you ve the heart of an angel an angel mihail_makarovitch i thank you for her i will i will be calm cheerful in fact
tell her in the kindness of your heart that i am cheerful quite cheerful that i shall be laughing in a minute knowing that she has a guardian angel like you
i shall have done with all this directly and as soon as i free i ll be with her she ll see let her wait
gentlemen he said turning to the two lawyers now i ll open my whole soul to you i ll pour out everything we ll finish this off directly finish it off gayly
we shall laugh at it in the end shant we but gentlemen that woman is the queen of my heart oh let me tell you that
that one thing i ll tell you now i see i with honorable man she is my light she is my holy one and if only you knew
did you hear her cry i ll go to death with you and what have i a penniless beggar done for her
how can a clumsy ugly brute like me with my ugly face deserve such love that she is ready to go to exile with me
why such love for me and how she fell down at your feet for my sake just now and yet she proud and has done nothing
how can i help adoring her how can i help crying out and rushing to her as i did just now
gentlemen forgive me but now now i am comforted and he sank back in his chair and covering his face with his hands burst into tears
but they were happy tears he recovered himself instantly the old police captain seemed much pleased and the lawyers also they felt that the examination was passing into a new phase
when the police captain went out mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was positively gay now gentlemen i am at your disposal entirely at your disposal
and if it were not for all these trivial details we should understand one another in a minute i at those details again
i at your disposal gentlemen but i declare that we must have mutual confidence you in me and i in you or there ll be no end to it
to business gentlemen to business and dont rummage in my soul dont tease me with trifles but only ask me about facts and what matters and i will satisfy you at once
i speak in your interests and damn the details so spoke mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the interrogation began again chapter iv the second ordeal
you dont know how you encourage us dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov by your readiness to answer said nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov with an animated air and obvious satisfaction beaming in his very prominent short sighted light gray eye from which he had removed his spectacles a moment before
and you have made a very just remark about the mutual confidence without which it is sometimes positively impossible to get on in cases of such importance if the suspected party really hopes and desires to defend himself and is in a position to do so
we on our side will do everything in our power and you can see for yourself how we are conducting the case
you approve ippolit_kirillovitch he turned to the prosecutor oh undoubtedly replied the prosecutor his tone was somewhat cold compared with nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov impulsiveness
i will note once for all that nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov who had but lately arrived among us had from the first felt marked respect for ippolit_kirillovitch our prosecutor and had become almost his bosom friend
he was almost the only person who put implicit faith in ippolit_kirillovitch extraordinary talents as a psychologist and orator and in the justice of his grievance
on the other hand young nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov was the only person in the whole world whom our unappreciated prosecutor genuinely liked
he had heard of him in petersburg on their way to mokroe they had time to come to an understanding about the present case
and now as they sat at the table the sharp witted junior caught and interpreted every indication on his senior colleague face half a word a glance or a wink
gentlemen only let me tell my own story and dont interrupt me with trivial questions and i ll tell you everything in a moment said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov excitedly
but before we proceed to listen to your communication will you allow me to inquire as to another little fact of great interest to us
i mean the ten roubles you borrowed yesterday at about five clock on the security of your pistol from your friend pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin
excellent thank you i pledged them gentlemen i pledged them for ten roubles what more that all about it as soon as i got back to town i pledged them
you got back to town then you had been out of town yes i went a journey of forty versts into the country
well how would it be if you began your story with a systematic description of all you did yesterday from the morning onwards
allow us for instance to inquire why you were absent from the town and just when you left and when you came back all those facts
you should have asked me like that from the beginning cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov laughing aloud and if you like we wont begin from yesterday but from the morning of the day before then you ll understand
i went the day before yesterday gentlemen to a merchant of the town called mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe security
didnt you know the prosecutor and nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov exchanged glances how why and where i went it was a pressing matter gentlemen it was a sudden necessity
allow me to interrupt you the prosecutor put in politely why were you in such pressing need for just that sum three thousand
oh gentlemen you neednt go into details how when and why and why just so much money and not so much and all that rigmarole
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov said all this with the good natured but impatient familiarity of a man who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full of the best intentions
why it ll run to three volumes and then you ll want an epilogue gentlemen he corrected himself hurriedly dont be vexed with me for my restiveness i beg you again
believe me once more i feel the greatest respect for you and understand the true position of affairs dont think i drunk
it with me you know like the saying when he is sober he is a fool when he is drunk he is a wise man
but i see gentlemen it not the proper thing to make jokes to you till we ve had our explanation i mean
i quite sober now and besides being drunk would be no hindrance ha ha and i ve my own dignity to keep up too
i quite understand the difference for the moment i am after all in the position of a criminal and so far from being on equal terms with you
i cant expect you to pat me on the head for what i did to grigory_vassilyevitch for one cant break old man heads with impunity
and it your business to watch me i suppose you ll put me away for him for six months or a year perhaps in a house of correction
i dont know what the punishment is but it will be without loss of the rights of my rank without loss of my rank wont it
so you see gentlemen i understand the distinction between us but you must see that you could puzzle god himself with such questions
how did you step where did you step when did you step and on what did you step i shall get mixed up if you go on like this and you will put it all down against me
and even if it nonsense i talking now let me finish and you gentlemen being man of honor and refinement will forgive me
and what will that lead to to nothing i ll finish by asking you gentlemen to drop that conventional method of questioning
i mean beginning from some miserable trifle how i got up what i had for breakfast how i spat and where i spat and so distracting the attention of the criminal
suddenly stun him with an overwhelming question whom did you murder whom did you rob ha ha that your regulation method
that where all your cunning comes in you can put peasants off their guard like that but not me i know the tricks
i ve been in the service too ha ha ha you re not angry gentlemen you forgive my impertinence he cried looking at them with a good nature that was almost surprising
it only mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov alyosha_karamazov you know so you can overlook it it would be inexcusable in a sensible man but you can forgive it in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
though the prosecutor did not laugh he kept his eye fixed keenly on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as though anxious not to miss the least syllable the slightest movement the smallest twitch of any feature of his face
ha ha nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov listened and laughed too that how we have treated you from the beginning said nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov still laughing
we havent tried to put you out by asking how you got up in the morning and what you had for breakfast
i saw it and appreciated it and i appreciate still more your present kindness to me an unprecedented kindness worthy of your noble hearts
we three here are gentlemen and let everything be on the footing of mutual confidence between educated well bred people who have the common bond of noble birth and honor
in any case allow me to look upon you as my best friends at this moment of my life at this moment when my honor is assailed
we began indeed with questions of the greatest importance i understand that no offense to you gentlemen is it on the contrary
you ve expressed all that so well dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov answered with dignified approbation and enough of those trivial questions gentlemen all those tricky questions cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov enthusiastically
or there simply no knowing where we shall get to is there i will follow your sensible advice entirely the prosecutor interposed addressing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
i dont withdraw my question however it is now vitally important for us to know exactly why you needed that sum i mean precisely three thousand
why i needed it oh for one thing and another well it was to pay a debt a debt to whom
not because i couldnt or because i shouldnt dare or because it would be damaging for it all a paltry matter and absolutely trifling but i wont because it a matter of principle that my private life and i wont allow any intrusion into my private life
your question has no bearing on the case and whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair
that i absolutely refuse to answer gentlemen that my principle i wanted to pay a debt i wanted to pay a debt of honor but to whom i wont say
allow me to make a note of that said the prosecutor by all means write down that i wont say that i wont
write that i should think it dishonorable to say ech you can write it you ve nothing else to do with your time
allow me to caution you sir and to remind you once more if you are unaware of it the prosecutor began with a peculiar and stern impressiveness that you have a perfect right not to answer the questions put to you now and we on our side have no right to extort an answer from you if you decline to give it for one reason or another
but it is our duty on the other hand in such cases as the present to explain and set before you the degree of injury you will be doing yourself by refusing to give this or that piece of evidence
that is entirely a matter for your personal decision after which i will beg you to continue gentlemen i not angry
i mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov muttered in a rather disconcerted tone well gentlemen you see that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to whom i went then
we will of course not reproduce his account of what is known to the reader already mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightest detail
at the same time he was in a hurry to get it over but as he gave his evidence it was written down and therefore they had continually to pull him up
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov disliked this but submitted got angry though still good humoredly he did it is true exclaim from time to time gentlemen that enough to make an angel out of patience
or gentlemen it no good your irritating me but even though he exclaimed he still preserved for a time his genially expansive mood
so he told them how mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had made a fool of him two day before he had completely realized by now that he had been fooled
they were at once greatly interested and even to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov intense indignation thought it necessary to write the fact down as a secondary confirmation of the circumstance that he had hardly a farthing in his pocket at the time
the sale of his watch for six roubles to obtain money for the journey was something new to the lawyers little by little mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began to grow surly
then after describing his journey to see lyagavy the night spent in the stifling hut and so on he came to his return to the town
here he began without being particularly urged to give a minute account of the agonies of jealousy he endured on grushenka account
they inquired particularly into the circumstance of his having a place of ambush in marya_kondratyevna house at the back of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov garden to keep watch on grushenka and of smerdyakov bringing him information
of his jealousy he spoke warmly and at length and though inwardly ashamed at exposing his most intimate feeling to public ignominy so to speak he evidently overcame his shame in order to tell the truth
the frigid severity with which the investigating lawyer and still more the prosecutor stared intently at him as he told his story disconcerted him at last considerably
that boy nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov to whom i was talking nonsense about women only a few day ago and that sickly prosecutor are not worth my telling this to he reflected mournfully
he was heard with silent attention they laid particular stress on this and noted it down it ignominious
be patient humble hold thy peace he wound up his reflections with that line but he pulled himself together to go on again
when he came to telling of his visit to madame_hohlakov he regained his spirits and even wished to tell a little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to do with the case
at last when he described his despair and told them how when he left madame_hohlakov he thought that he get three thousand if he had to murder some one to do it they stopped him again and noted down that he had meant to murder some one
but the investigating lawyer stopped him and civilly suggested that he should pass on to more essential matters mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov let them write it without protest
at last he reached the point in his story when he learned that grushenka had deceived him and had returned from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as soon as he left her there though she had said that she would stay there till midnight
if i didnt kill fenya then gentlemen it was only because i hadnt time broke from him suddenly at that point in his story
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov waited gloomily and was beginning to tell how he ran into his father_zossima garden when the investigating lawyer suddenly stopped him and opening the big portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him he brought out the brass pestle
that too was carefully written down do you recognize this object he asked showing it to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
oh yes he laughed gloomily of course i recognize it let me have a look at it damn it never mind
you have forgotten to mention it observed the investigating lawyer hang it all i shouldnt have concealed it from you
do you suppose i could have managed without it it simply escaped my memory be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with it
certainly i will be so good gentlemen and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov described how he took the pestle and ran but what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a weapon
what object no object i just picked it up and ran off what for if you had no object
he was feeling more and more ashamed at having told such people the story of his jealousy so sincerely and spontaneously
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov wrath flared up he looked intently at the boy and smiled gloomily and malignantly bother the pestle broke from him suddenly
but have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when you went out since you re afraid of the dark
but still oh to keep off dogs oh because it was dark in case anything turned up ugh damn it all gentlemen
cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov exasperated beyond endurance and turning to the secretary crimson with anger he said quickly with a note of fury in his voice write down at once at once that i snatched up the pestle to go and kill my father_zossima
there positively no talking to you fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov by hitting him on the head with it well now are you satisfied gentlemen
we quite understand that you made that statement just now through exasperation with us and the questions we put to you which you consider trivial though they are in fact essential the prosecutor remarked dryly in reply
are your minds relieved he said glaring defiantly at the lawyers well upon my word gentlemen yes i took the pestle
what does one pick things up for at such moments i dont know what for i snatched it up and ran that all
for to me gentlemen passons or i declare i wont tell you any more he sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand
he had in fact an awful inclination to get up and declare that he wouldnt say another word not if you hang me for it
he sat sideways to them and gazed at the wall struggling against a feeling of nausea you see gentlemen he said at last with difficulty controlling himself you see
i listen to you and am haunted by a dream it a dream i have sometimes you know i often dream it it always the same that some one is hunting me
some one i awfully afraid of that he hunting me in the dark in the night tracking me and i hide somewhere from him behind a door or cupboard hide in a degrading way and the worst of it is he always knows where i am
but he pretends not to know where i am on purpose to prolong my agony to enjoy my terror that just what you re doing now
it just like that is that the sort of thing you dream about inquired the prosecutor yes it is dont you want to write it down said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with a distorted smile
no no need to write it down but still you do have curious dreams it not a question of dreams now gentlemen this is realism this is real life
i a wolf and you re the hunters well hunt him down you are wrong to make such comparisons began nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov with extraordinary softness
no i not wrong not at all mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov flared up again though his outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart
you may not trust a criminal or a man on trial tortured by your questions but an honorable man the honorable impulses of the heart i say that boldly no
he grew more good humored at every word that you must believe you have no right indeed but be silent heart be patient humble hold thy peace
well shall i go on he broke off gloomily if you ll be so kind answered nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov chapter
though mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov spoke sullenly it was evident that he was trying more than ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his story
he told them how he had leapt over the fence into his father_zossima garden how he had gone up to the window told them all that had passed under the window
clearly precisely distinctly he described the feeling that troubled him during those moments in the garden when he longed so terribly to know whether grushenka was with his father_zossima or not
but strange to say both the lawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve looked coldly at him asked few questions
the third ordeal mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov could gather nothing from their faces they re angry and offended he thought well bother them
when he described how he made up his mind at last to make the signal to his father_zossima that grushenka had come so that he should open the window the lawyers paid no attention to the word signal as though they entirely failed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection so much so that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov noticed it
coming at last to the moment when seeing his father_zossima peering out of the window his hatred flared up and he pulled the pestle out of his pocket he suddenly as though of design stopped short
he sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eye were fixed upon him well said the investigating lawyer
you pulled out the weapon and and what happened then then why then i murdered him hit him on the head and cracked his skull
i suppose that your story that it his eye suddenly flashed all his smothered wrath suddenly flamed up with extraordinary violence in his soul
our story repeated nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov well and yours mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov dropped his eye and was a long time silent
whether it was some one tears or my mother prayed to god or a good angel kissed me at that instant i dont know
my story gentlemen well it was like this he began softly but the devil was conquered i rushed from the window and ran to the fence
my father_zossima was alarmed and for the first time he saw me then cried out and sprang back from the window
i ran across the garden to the fence and there grigory_vassilyevitch caught me when i was sitting on the fence
i remember that very well at that point he raised his eye at last and looked at his listeners they seemed to be staring at him with perfectly unruffled attention
a sort of paroxysm of indignation seized on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov soul why you re laughing at me at this moment gentlemen
he broke off suddenly what makes you think that observed nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov you dont believe one word that why i understand of course that i have come to the vital point
the old man lying there now with his skull broken while i after dramatically describing how i wanted to kill him and how i snatched up the pestle i suddenly run away from the window
a romance poetry as though one could believe a fellow on his word ha ha you are scoffers gentlemen and he swung round on his chair so that it creaked
and did you notice asked the prosecutor suddenly as though not observing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov excitement did you notice when you ran away from the window whether the door into the garden was open
no it was not open it was not it was shut and who could open it bah the door
wait a bit he seemed suddenly to bethink himself and almost with a start why did you find the door open
yes it was open why who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov greatly astonished
the door stood open and your father_zossima murderer undoubtedly went in at that door and having accomplished the crime went out again by the same door the prosecutor pronounced deliberately as though chiseling out each word separately
the murder was committed in the room and not through the window that is absolutely certain from the examination that has been made from the position of the body and everything
that is perfectly clear there can be no doubt of that circumstance mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was absolutely dumbfounded but that utterly impossible
i tell you positively definitely the door was shut the whole time i was in the garden and when i ran out of the garden
he cried completely at a loss i i didnt go in i only stood at the window and saw him through the window
that all that all i remember to the last minute and if i didnt remember it would be just the same
i know it for no one knew the signals except smerdyakov and me and the dead man and he wouldnt have opened the door to any one in the world without the signals
signals what signals asked the prosecutor with greedy almost hysterical curiosity he instantly lost all trace of his reserve and dignity
he scented an important fact of which he had known nothing and was already filled with dread that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov might be unwilling to disclose it
he asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity so you didnt know mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov winked at him with a malicious and mocking smile
what if i wont tell you from whom could you find out no one knew about the signals except my father_zossima smerdyakov and me that was all
heaven knew too but it wont tell you but it an interesting fact there no knowing what you might build on it
ha ha take comfort gentlemen i ll reveal it you ve some foolish idea in your hearts you dont know the man you have to deal with
you have to do with a prisoner who gives evidence against himself to his own damage yes for i a man of honor and you are not
the prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur he was trembling with impatience to hear the new fact minutely and diffusely mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov told them everything about the signals invented by fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov for smerdyakov
he told them exactly what every tap on the window meant tapped the signals on the table and when nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov said that he supposed he mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had tapped the signal
grushenka has come when he tapped to his father_zossima he answered precisely that he had tapped that signal that grushenka had come
so now you can build up your tower mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov broke off and again turned away from them contemptuously so no one knew of the signals but your dead father_zossima you and the valet smerdyakov
and no one else nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov inquired once more yes the valet smerdyakov and heaven write down about heaven
that may be of use besides you will need god yourselves and they had already of course begun writing it down
but if smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny all responsibility for the death of your father_zossima was it not he perhaps who knocked the signal agreed upon induced your father_zossima to open to him and then committed the crime
but while they wrote the prosecutor said suddenly as though pitching on a new idea mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov turned upon him a look of profound irony and intense hatred
his silent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink you ve caught the fox again commented mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at last you ve got the beast by the tail
you thought of course that i should jump at that catch at your prompting and shout with all my might aie
ha ha i see through you mr prosecutor it smerdyakov he the murderer confess that what you thought confess and i ll go on
but the prosecutor did not confess he held his tongue and waited you re mistaken i not going to shout
it smerdyakov said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and you dont even suspect him why do you suspect him he is suspected too
from the very beginning almost from the moment when i ran out to you from behind the curtain i ve had the thought of smerdyakov in my mind
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov fixed his eye on the floor joking apart he brought out gloomily listen i ve been sitting here shouting that i innocent and thinking all the time smerdyakov
i cant get smerdyakov out of my head in fact i too thought of smerdyakov just now but only for a second
almost at once i thought no it not smerdyakov it not his doing gentlemen in that case is there anybody else you suspect
i dont know any one it could be whether it the hand of heaven or satan but not smerdyakov mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jerked out with decision
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov inquired cautiously but what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it not he from my conviction my impression
because smerdyakov is a man of the most abject character and a coward he not a coward he the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs
when he talked to me he was always trembling for fear i should kill him though i never raised my hand against him
he has the heart of a chicken he fell at my feet and blubbered he has kissed these very boots literally beseeching me not to frighten him
do you hear not to frighten him what a thing to say why i offered him money he a puling chicken sickly epileptic weak minded a child of eight could thrash him
he has no character worth talking about it not smerdyakov gentlemen he doesnt care for money he wouldnt take my presents
besides what motive had he for murdering the old man why he very likely his son you know his natural son do you know that
we have heard that legend but you are your father_zossima son too you know yet you yourself told every one you meant to murder him
that a thrust and a nasty mean one too i not afraid oh gentlemen isnt it too base of you to say that to my face
it base because i told you that myself i not only wanted to murder him but i might have done it
and what more i went out of my way to tell you of my own accord that i nearly murdered him
but you see i didnt murder him you see my guardian angel saved me that what you ve not taken into account and that why it so base of you
for i didnt kill him i didnt kill him do you hear i did not kill him he was almost choking
he had not been so moved before during the whole interrogation and what has he told you gentlemen smerdyakov i mean
you may ask any question the prosecutor replied with frigid severity any question relating to the facts of the case and we are i repeat bound to answer every inquiry you make
we found the servant smerdyakov concerning whom you inquire lying unconscious in his bed in an epileptic fit of extreme severity that had recurred possibly ten time
he added suddenly after a pause may i ask that question the doctor who was with us told us after seeing him that he may possibly not outlive the night
well if that so the devil must have killed him broke suddenly from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as though until that moment he had been asking himself
was it smerdyakov or not we will come back to this later nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov decided now wouldnt you like to continue your statement
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov asked for a rest his request was courteously granted after resting he went on with his story but he was evidently depressed
he was exhausted mortified and morally shaken to make things worse the prosecutor exasperated him as though intentionally by vexatious interruptions about trifling points
scarcely had mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov described how sitting on the wall he had struck grigory_vassilyevitch on the head with the pestle while the old man had hold of his left leg and how he had then jumped down to look at him when the prosecutor stopped him to ask him to describe exactly how he was sitting on the wall
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was surprised oh i was sitting like this astride one leg on one side of the wall and one on the other
and the pestle the pestle was in my hand not in your pocket do you remember that precisely
would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then and showing us just how you moved your arm and in what direction
was it a violent blow you gave him it must have been a violent one but why do you ask
you re making fun of me arent you asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looking haughtily at the speaker but the latter did not flinch
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov turned abruptly sat astride on his chair and swung his arm this was how i struck him that how i knocked him down
what more do you want thank you may i trouble you now to explain why you jumped down with what object and what you had in view
oh hang it i jumped down to look at the man i hurt i dont know what for though you were so excited and were running away
yes though i was excited and running away you wanted to help him help yes perhaps i did want to help him
i dont remember you dont remember then you didnt quite know what you were doing not at all i remember everything every detail
i jumped down to look at him and wiped his face with my handkerchief we have seen your handkerchief did you hope to restore him to consciousness
i dont know whether i hoped it i simply wanted to make sure whether he was alive or not ah you wanted to be sure
well what then i not a doctor i couldnt decide i ran away thinking i killed him and now he recovered
it never entered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov head to tell them though he remembered it that he had jumped back from pity and standing over the prostrate figure had even uttered some words of regret you ve come to grief old man there no help for it
excellent commented the prosecutor thank you that all i wanted kindly proceed alas well there you must lie
the prosecutor could only draw one conclusion that the man had jumped back at such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object of ascertaining whether the only witness of his crime were dead that he must therefore have been a man of great strength coolness decision and foresight even at such a moment and so on
the prosecutor was satisfied i ve provoked the nervous fellow by trifles and he has said more than he meant to
how came you to run to the servant fedosya markovna with your hands so covered with blood and as it appears your face too
with painful effort mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov went on but this time he was pulled up immediately by nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov why i didnt notice the blood at all at the time answered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
that quite likely it does happen sometimes the prosecutor exchanged glances with nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov i simply didnt notice
you re quite right there prosecutor mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov assented suddenly next came the account of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sudden determination to step aside and make way for their happiness
but he could not make up his mind to open his heart to them as before and tell them about the queen of his soul
and so in response to their reiterated questions he answered briefly and abruptly well i made up my mind to kill myself
he disliked speaking of her before these chilly person who were fastening on him like bugs what had i left to live for
her first rightful lover had come back the man who wronged her but who hurried back to offer his love after five years and atone for the wrong with marriage
that question stared me in the face so i knew it was all over for me and behind me disgrace and that blood grigory_vassilyevitch
so i went to redeem the pistol i had pledged to load them and put a bullet in my brain to morrow
what had i to live for and a grand feast the night before yes a grand feast the night before damn it all gentlemen
i meant to shoot myself not far from here beyond the village and i planned to do it at five clock in the morning
do make haste and finish it and i had a note in my pocket already i wrote it at pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin when i loaded my pistol
here the letter read it it not for you i tell it he added contemptuously he took it from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the table
the lawyers read it with curiosity and as is usual added it to the papers connected with the case and you didnt even think of washing your hands at pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin
suspicion or not i should have galloped here just the same and shot myself at five clock and you wouldnt have been in time to do anything
if it hadnt been for what happened to my father_zossima you would have known nothing about it and wouldnt have come here
you were not afraid then of arousing suspicion what suspicion oh it the devil doing it was the devil murdered father_zossima it was through the devil that you found it out so soon
mr pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin informed us that when you came to him you held in your hands your blood stained hands your money a lot of money a bundle of hundred rouble notes and that his servant boy saw it too
how did you manage to get here so quick it marvelous a dream that true gentlemen i remember it was so
can you inform us nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov began with extreme gentleness where did you get so much money all of a sudden when it appears from the facts from the reckoning of time that you had not been home
now there one little point presents itself the prosecutor brows contracted at the question being asked so plainly but he did not interrupt nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov
no i didnt go home answered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov apparently perfectly composed but looking at the floor allow me then to repeat my question nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov went on as though creeping up to the subject
where were you able to procure such a sum all at once when by your own confession at five clock the same day you i was in want of ten roubles and pledged my pistol with pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin and then went to madame_hohlakov to borrow three thousand which she wouldnt give me and so on and all the rest of it mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov interrupted sharply
yes gentlemen i was in want of it and suddenly thousands turned up eh do you know gentlemen you re both afraid now what if he wont tell us where he got it
that just how it is i not going to tell you gentlemen you ve guessed right you ll never know said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov chipping out each word with extraordinary determination
you must understand mr alyosha_karamazov that it is of vital importance for us to know said nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov softly and suavely
the prosecutor too intervened and again reminded the prisoner that he was at liberty to refuse to answer questions if he thought it to his interest and so on
but in view of the damage he might do himself by his silence especially in a case of such importance as
the lawyers were silent for a moment i understand but still i wont tell you and so on gentlemen and so on
i can see for myself how important it is and that this is the vital point and still i wont say
enough i ve heard that rigmarole before mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov interrupted again what is it to us it not our business but yours
you see gentlemen joking apart mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov lifted his eye and looked firmly at them both i had an inkling from the first that we should come to loggerheads at this point
but at first when i began to give my evidence it was all still far away and misty it was all floating and i was so simple that i began with the supposition of mutual confidence existing between us
now i can see for myself that such confidence is out of the question for in any case we were bound to come to this cursed stumbling block
you are doing yourself harm observed nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov nervously and now we ve come to it it impossible and there an end of it
but i dont blame you you cant believe it all simply on my word i understand that of course he relapsed into gloomy silence
couldnt you without abandoning your resolution to be silent about the chief point could you not at the same time give us some slight hint as to the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you to refuse to answer at a crisis so full of danger to you
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov smiled mournfully almost dreamily i much more good natured than you think gentlemen i ll tell you the reason why and give you that hint though you dont deserve it
the answer to the question where i got the money would expose me to far greater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father_zossima if i had murdered and robbed him
i wont speak of that gentlemen because it would be a stain on my honor that why i cant tell you
i cant for fear of disgrace what gentlemen are you going to write that down yes we ll write it down lisped nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov
you ought not to write that down about disgrace i only told you that in the goodness of my heart
i neednt have told you i made you a present of it so to speak and you pounce upon it at once
oh well write write what you like he concluded with scornful disgust i not afraid of you and i can still hold up my head before you
and cant you tell us the nature of that disgrace nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov hazarded the prosecutor frowned darkly no no est fini dont trouble yourselves
it not worth while soiling one hands i have soiled myself enough through you as it is you re not worth it no one is
enough gentlemen i not going on this was said too peremptorily nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov did not insist further but from ippolit_kirillovitch eye he saw that he had not given up hope
can you not at least tell us what sum you had in your hands when you went into mr pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin
how many roubles exactly i cant tell you that you spoke to mr pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin i believe of having received three thousand from madame_hohlakov
will you be so good then as to tell us how you came here and what you have done since you arrived
perhaps i did enough gentlemen i wont say how much i had oh you might ask the people here about that
but i ll tell you if you like he proceeded to do so but we wont repeat his story he told it dryly and curtly
of the raptures of his love he said nothing but told them that he abandoned his determination to shoot himself owing to new factors in the case
he told the story without going into motives or details and this time the lawyers did not worry him much
we will come back to it during the examination of the witnesses which will of course take place in your presence said nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov in conclusion
it was obvious that there was no essential point of interest to them here we shall verify all that
and now allow me to request you to lay on the table everything in your possession especially all the money you still have about you
my money gentlemen certainly i understand that that is necessary i surprised indeed that you havent inquired about it before
it true i couldnt get away anywhere i sitting here where i can be seen but here my money count it take it
he turned it all out of his pockets even the small change two pieces of twenty copecks he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket
that all i think they counted the money which amounted to eight hundred and thirty six roubles and forty copecks
and is that all asked the investigating lawyer yes you stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles at plotnikovs
you gave pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin ten your driver twenty here you lost two hundred then nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov reckoned it all up mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov helped him readily
they recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov hurriedly added up the total with this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at first
i suppose so snapped mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov how is it they all assert there was much more let them assert it
but you asserted it yourself yes i did too we will compare all this with the evidence of other person not yet examined
dont be anxious about your money it will be properly taken care of and be at your disposal at the conclusion of
what is beginning if it appears or so to speak is proved that you have undisputed right to it well and now
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov suddenly got up and informed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov firmly that it was his duty and obligation to conduct a minute and thorough search of your clothes and everything else
by all means gentlemen i ll turn out all my pockets if you like and he did in fact begin turning out his pockets
it will be necessary to take off your clothes too what undress ugh damn it wont you search me as i am
cant you it utterly impossible dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you must take off your clothes as you like mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov submitted gloomily only please not here but behind the curtains
who will search them behind the curtains of course nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov bent his head in assent his small face wore an expression of peculiar solemnity
chapter vi the prosecutor catches mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov something utterly unexpected and amazing to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov followed he could never even a minute before have conceived that any one could behave like that to him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov alyosha_karamazov
it was nothing to take off his coat but he was asked to undress further or rather not asked but commanded he quite understood that
what was worst of all there was something humiliating in it and on their side something supercilious and scornful from pride and contempt he submitted without a word
several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain to be ready if force is required thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and perhaps for some other reason too
he was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat the trousers the waistcoat and the cap and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny
well must i take off my shirt too he asked sharply but nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov did not answer
they make no bones about it thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov they dont keep up the most elementary politeness i ask you for the second time need i take off my shirt or not
we will tell you what to do nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov said and his voice was positively peremptory or so it seemed to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
he said still more sharply and irritably dont trouble yourself meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers
there turned out to be on the coat especially on the left side at the back a huge patch of blood dry and still stiff
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov moreover in the presence of the peasant witnesses passed his fingers along the collar the cuffs and all the seams of the coat and trousers obviously looking for something money of course
there were bloodstains on the trousers too he didnt even hide from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov his suspicion that he was capable of sewing money up in his clothes
he treats me not as an officer but as a thief mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov muttered to himself they communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness
the secretary for instance who was also behind the curtain fussing about and listening called nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov attention to the cap which they were also fingering
last summer he received the wages of the whole office and pretended to have lost the money when he was drunk
you remember gridyenko the copying clerk observed the secretary and where was it found why in just such pipings in his cap
both the lawyers remembered gridyenko case perfectly and so laid aside mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cap and decided that all his clothes must be more thoroughly examined later
excuse me cried nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov suddenly noticing that the right cuff of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov shirt was turned in and covered with blood excuse me what that blood
the hundred rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the piping yes mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov jerked out
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov told him how he had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after grigory_vassilyevitch and had turned it inside when he was washing his hands at pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin
that is what blood and why is the cuff turned in you must take off your shirt too
that very important as material evidence mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov flushed red and flew into a rage what am i to stay naked
he shouted dont disturb yourself we will arrange something and meanwhile take off your socks you re not joking
is that really necessary mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov eye flashed we are in no mood for joking answered nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov sternly well if i must muttered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and sitting down on the bed he took off his socks
all were clothed while he was naked and strange to say when he was undressed he felt somehow guilty in their presence and was almost ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them and that now they had a perfect right to despise him
when all are undressed one is somehow not ashamed but when one the only one undressed and everybody is looking it degrading he kept repeating to himself again and again
he felt unbearably awkward it like a dream i ve sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions it was a misery to him to take off his socks
they were very dirty and so were his underclothes and now every one could see it and what was worse he disliked his feet
all his life he had thought both his big toes hideous he particularly loathed the coarse flat crooked nail on the right one and now they would all see it
feeling intolerably ashamed made him at once and intentionally rougher he pulled off his shirt himself would you like to look anywhere else if you re not ashamed to
no there no need to at present well am i to stay naked like this he added savagely
yes that cant be helped for the time kindly sit down here for a while you can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed and i_
the report of the search was drawn up and at last nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov went out and the clothes were carried out after him
i ll see to all this all the things were shown to the witnesses ippolit_kirillovitch went out too mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was left alone with the peasants who stood in silence never taking their eye off him
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov wrapped himself up in the quilt he felt cold his bare feet stuck out and he couldnt pull the quilt over so as to cover them
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov seemed to be gone a long time an insufferable time he thinks of me as a puppy thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov gnashing his teeth
that rotten prosecutor has gone too contemptuous no doubt it disgusts him to see me naked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov imagined however that his clothes would be examined and returned to him
but what was his indignation when nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov came back with quite different clothes brought in behind him by a peasant
here are clothes for you he observed airily seeming well satisfied with the success of his mission mr pyotr_fomitch_kalganov has kindly provided these for this unusual emergency as well as a clean shirt
luckily he had them all in his trunk you can keep your own socks and underclothes mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov flew into a passion
i wont have other people clothes he shouted menacingly give me my own it impossible give me my own
damn pyotr_fomitch_kalganov and his clothes too it was a long time before they could persuade him but they succeeded somehow in quieting him down
they impressed upon him that his clothes being stained with blood must be included with the other material evidence and that they had not even the right to let him have them now taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case
he merely observed as he put them on that the clothes were much better than his old ones and that he disliked gaining by the change
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at last understood this he subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself the coat was besides ridiculously tight
they urged upon him again that he was exaggerating that pyotr_fomitch_kalganov was only a little taller so that only the trousers might be a little too long
am i to be dressed up like a fool for your amusement but the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders
be so good as to tell mr pyotr_fomitch_kalganov from me that i didnt ask for his clothes and it not my doing that they ve dressed me up like a clown
damn it all i can hardly button it mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov grumbled he understands that and is sorry i mean not sorry to lend you his clothes but sorry about all this business mumbled nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov
confound his sorrow well where now am i to go on sitting here he was asked to go back to the other room
dressed in another man clothes he felt himself disgraced even in the eye of the peasants and of trifon_borissovitch whose face appeared for some reason in the doorway and vanished immediately
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov went in scowling with anger and trying to avoid looking at any one he come to look at me dressed up thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
he sat down on the same chair as before he had an absurd nightmarish feeling as though he were out of his mind
well what now are you going to flog me that all that left for you he said clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor
he looked too closely at my socks and turned them inside out on purpose to show every one how dirty they were the scoundrel
he would not turn to nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov as though he disdained to speak to him well now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses observed nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov as though in reply to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov question
we ve done what we could in your interest dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov went on but having received from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money found upon you we are at the present moment
yes said the prosecutor thoughtfully as though reflecting on something what is the stone in your ring
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov interrupted suddenly as though awakening from a reverie he pointed to one of the three large rings adorning nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov right hand
ring repeated nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov with surprise yes that one on your middle finger with the little veins in it what stone is that
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov persisted like a peevish child that a smoky topaz said nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov smiling would you like to look at it
i ll take it off no dont take it off cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov furiously suddenly waking up and angry with himself
can you suppose that i would conceal it from you if i had really killed my father_zossima that i would shuffle lie and hide myself
no that not like dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov that he couldnt do and if i were guilty i swear i shouldnt have waited for your coming or for the sunrise as i meant at first but should have killed myself before this without waiting for the dawn
dont take it off there no need damn it gentlemen you ve sullied my heart i know that about myself now
and should i have been like this on this night and at this moment sitting with you could i have talked like this could i have moved like this could i have looked at you and at the world like this if i had really been the murderer of my father_zossima when the very thought of having accidentally killed grigory_vassilyevitch gave me no peace all night not from fear
i couldnt have learnt so much in twenty years as i ve found out in this accursed night oh not simply from fear of your punishment
and you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you who see nothing and believe in nothing blind moles and scoffers and to tell you another nasty thing i ve done another disgrace even if that would save me from your accusation
the man who opened the door to my father_zossima and went in at that door he killed him he robbed him
but i can tell you it was not dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov and that all i can tell you and that enough enough leave me alone
the disgrace of it no better siberia who was he i racking my brains and cant think who exile me punish me but dont bother me any more
i ll say no more call your witnesses mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov uttered his sudden monologue as though he were determined to be absolutely silent for the future
the prosecutor watched him the whole time and only when he had ceased speaking observed as though it were the most ordinary thing with the most frigid and composed air
oh about the open door of which you spoke just now we may as well inform you by the way now of a very interesting piece of evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us that has been given us by grigory_vassilyevitch the old man you wounded
on his recovery he clearly and emphatically stated in reply to our questions that when on coming out to the steps and hearing a noise in the garden he made up his mind to go into it through the little gate which stood open before he noticed you running as you have told us already in the dark from the open window where you saw your father_zossima he grigory_vassilyevitch glanced to the left and while noticing the open window observed at the same time much nearer to him the door standing wide open that door which you have stated to have been shut the whole time you were in the garden
i will not conceal from you that grigory_vassilyevitch himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must have run from that door though of course he did not see you do so with his own eye since he only noticed you first some distance away in the garden running towards the fence
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had leapt up from his chair half way through this speech nonsense he yelled in a sudden frenzy it a barefaced lie
he couldnt have seen the door open because it was shut he lying i consider it my duty to repeat that he is firm in his statement
he does not waver he adheres to it we ve cross examined him several time precisely i have cross examined him several time nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov confirmed warmly
it false false it either an attempt to slander me or the hallucination of a madman mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov still shouted
he simply raving from loss of blood from the wound he must have fancied it when he came to he raving
yes but he noticed the open door not when he came to after his injuries but before that as soon as he went into the garden from the lodge
but it false it false it cant be so he slandering me from spite he couldnt have seen it
i didnt come from the door gasped mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the prosecutor turned to nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov and said to him impressively confront him with it
do you recognize this object nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov laid upon the table a large and thick official envelope on which three seals still remained intact
it it must be that envelope of my father_zossima the envelope that contained the three thousand roubles and if there inscribed on it allow me for my little chicken
the envelope was empty and slit open at one end mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stared at it with open eye yes three thousand he shouted do you see three thousand do you see
of course we see but we didnt find the money in it it was empty and lying on the floor by the bed behind the screen
for some second mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stood as though thunderstruck gentlemen it smerdyakov he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice
it he who murdered him he robbed him no one else knew where the old man hid the envelope it smerdyakov
that clear now but you too knew of the envelope and that it was under the pillow i never knew it
i ve never seen it this is the first time i ve looked at it i only heard of it from smerdyakov he was the only one who knew where the old man kept it hidden i didnt know
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was completely breathless but you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased father_zossima pillow you especially stated that it was under the pillow so you must have known it
we ve got it written down confirmed nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov nonsense it absurd i no idea it was under the pillow and perhaps it wasnt under the pillow at all
it was just a chance guess that it was under the pillow what does smerdyakov say have you asked him where it was
what does smerdyakov say that the chief point and i went out of my way to tell lies against myself i told you without thinking that it was under the pillow and now
you oh you know how one says the wrong thing without meaning it no one knew but smerdyakov only smerdyakov and no one else
he didnt even tell me where it was but it his doing his doing there no doubt about it he murdered him
that as clear as daylight now mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov exclaimed more and more frantically repeating himself incoherently and growing more and more exasperated and excited
you must understand that and arrest him at once he must have killed him while i was running away and
while grigory_vassilyevitch was unconscious that clear now he gave the signal and father_zossima opened to him for no one but he knew the signal and without the signal father_zossima would never have opened the door
but you re again forgetting the circumstance the prosecutor observed still speaking with the same restraint though with a note of triumph that there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open when you were there while you were in the garden
the door the door muttered mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and he stared speechless at the prosecutor he sank back helpless in his chair
all were silent yes the door it a nightmare god is against me he exclaimed staring before him in complete stupefaction
on the one hand we have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out a fact which overwhelms you and us
on the other side your incomprehensible persistent and so to speak obdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the money which was so suddenly seen in your hands when only three hours earlier on your own showing you pledged your pistol for the sake of ten roubles
come you see the prosecutor went on with dignity and you can judge for yourself dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in view of all these facts judge for yourself
and dont accuse us of being frigid cynical scoffing people who are incapable of believing in the generous impulses of your heart
what are we to believe and what can we depend upon try to enter into our position mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was indescribably agitated
he turned pale very well he exclaimed suddenly i will tell you my secret i ll tell you where i got the money
and believe me dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov put in nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov in a voice of almost pathetic delight that every sincere and complete confession on your part at this moment may later on have an immense influence in your favor and may indeed moreover
i ll reveal my shame that i may not have to blame myself or you hereafter but the prosecutor gave him a slight shove under the table and he checked himself in time
received with hisses gentlemen he began still in the same agitation i want to make a full confession that money was my own
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov it is true had not heard him chapter vii mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov great secret the lawyers faces lengthened that was not at all what they expected
how do you mean faltered nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov when at five clock on the same day from your own confession damn five clock on the same day and my own confession
that money was my own my own that is stolen by me not mine i mean but stolen by me and it was fifteen hundred roubles and i had it on me all the time all the time
that nothing to do with it now but where did you get it i took it off my neck gentlemen off this very neck
it was here round my neck sewn up in a rag and i had it round my neck a long time
it a month since i put it round my neck to my shame and disgrace and from whom did you appropriate it
you mean steal it speak out plainly now yes i consider that i practically stole it but if you prefer i appropriated it
i consider i stole it and last night i stole it finally last night but you said that it a month since you obtained it
yes but not from my father_zossima not from my father_zossima dont be uneasy i didnt steal it from my father_zossima but from her
let me tell you without interrupting it hard to do you know you see a month ago i was sent for by katerina_ivanovna formerly my betrothed
do you know her yes of course i know you know her she a noble creature noblest of the noble
but she has hated me ever so long oh ever so long and hated me with good reason good reason
katerina_ivanovna nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov exclaimed with wonder the prosecutor too stared oh dont take her name in vain i a scoundrel to bring her into it
yes i ve seen that she hated me a long while from the very first even that evening at my lodging but enough enough
i need only tell you that she sent for me a month ago gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her sister and another relation in moscow as though she couldnt have sent it off herself
it was just at that fatal moment in my life when i well in fact when i just come to love another her she sitting down below now grushenka
i carried her off here to mokroe then and wasted here in two day half that damned three thousand but the other half i kept on me
well i ve kept that other half that fifteen hundred like a locket round my neck but yesterday i undid it and spent it
you re unworthy even to know of that no need of that at all and i what left of it eight hundred roubles is in your hands now nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov
that the change out of the fifteen hundred i had yesterday excuse me how that why when you were here a month ago you spent three thousand not fifteen hundred everybody knows that
who knows it who counted the money did i let any one count it why you told every one yourself that you spent exactly three thousand
it true i did i told the whole town so and the whole town said so and here at mokroe too every one reckoned it was three thousand
yet i didnt spend three thousand but fifteen hundred and the other fifteen hundred i sewed into a little bag that how it was gentlemen
that where i got that money yesterday this is almost miraculous murmured nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov allow me to inquire observed the prosecutor at last have you informed any one whatever of this circumstance before
i mean that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago i told no one that strange do you mean absolutely no one
absolutely no one no one and nobody what was your reason for this reticence what was your motive for making such a secret of it
to be more precise you have told us at last your secret in your words so disgraceful though in reality that is of course comparatively speaking this action that is the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to some one else and of course only for a time is in my view at least only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful when one takes into consideration your character
many people have already guessed during this last month about the three thousand of katerina_ivanovna that you have spent and i heard the legend myself apart from your confession
mihail_makarovitch for instance had heard it too so that indeed it was scarcely a legend but the gossip of the whole town
there are indications too if i am not mistaken that you confessed this yourself to some one i mean that the money was katerina_ivanovna and so it extremely surprising to me that hitherto
that is up to the present moment you have made such an extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret
even admitting that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable still discreditable is not disgraceful it not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a secret
you cried out just now that siberia would be better than confessing it the prosecutor ceased speaking he was provoked
he did not conceal his vexation which was almost anger and gave vent to all his accumulated spleen disconnectedly and incoherently without choosing words
it not the fifteen hundred that the disgrace but that i put it apart from the rest of the three thousand said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov firmly
what is there disgraceful to your thinking in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had discreditably if you prefer disgracefully appropriated
why smiled the prosecutor irritably your taking the three thousand is more important than what you did with it
and by the way why did you do that why did you set apart that half for what purpose for what object did you do it
i put it aside because i was vile that is because i was calculating and to be calculating in such a case is vile and that vileness has been going on a whole month
can you explain that to us oh gentlemen the purpose is the whole point cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
it incomprehensible i wonder at you but i ll make it clearer perhaps it really is incomprehensible you see attend to what i say
i appropriate three thousand entrusted to my honor i spend it on a spree say i spend it all and next morning i go to her and say katya i ve done wrong
i ve squandered your three thousand well is that right no it not right it dishonest and cowardly i a beast with no more self control than a beast that so isnt it
but still i not a thief not a downright thief you ll admit i squandered it but i didnt steal it now a second rather more favorable alternative follow me carefully or i may get confused again
my head going round and so for the second alternative i spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand that is only half
next day i go and take that half to her katya take this fifteen hundred from me i a low beast and an untrustworthy scoundrel for i ve wasted half the money and i shall waste this too so keep me from temptation
i should be a beast and a scoundrel and whatever you like but not a thief not altogether a thief or i should not have brought back what was left but have kept that too
she would see at once that since i brought back half i should pay back what i spent that i should never give up trying to that i should work to get it and pay it back
so in that case i should be a scoundrel but not a thief you may say what you like not a thief
well what of that alternative i admit that there is a certain distinction said the prosecutor with a cold smile
every man may be a scoundrel and perhaps every man is a scoundrel but not every one can be a thief it takes an arch scoundrel to be that
oh of course i dont know how to make these fine distinctions but a thief is lower than a scoundrel that my conviction
listen i carry the money about me a whole month i may make up my mind to give it back to morrow and i a scoundrel no longer but i cannot make up my mind you see though i making up my mind every day and every day spurring myself on to do it and yet for a whole month i cant bring myself to it you see
but it strange that you see such a vital difference yes i see a vital difference is that right to your thinking is that right
and let us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions and if you will be so kind get back to the point
and the point is that you have still not told us altogether we ve asked you why in the first place you halved the money squandering one half and hiding the other
certainly that not right that i can quite understand and that i dont dispute answered the prosecutor with reserve for what purpose exactly did you hide it
what did you mean to do with that fifteen hundred i insist upon that question dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov yes of course
cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov striking himself on the forehead forgive me i worrying you and am not explaining the chief point or you understand in a minute for it just the motive of it
that the disgrace you see it was all to do with the old man my dead father_zossima he was always pestering agrafena_alexandrovna and i was jealous
so i kept thinking every day suppose she were to make up her mind all of a sudden suppose she were to leave off tormenting me and were suddenly to say to me i love you not him take me to the other end of the world
i thought then that she was hesitating between me and him and i only forty copecks how could i take her away what could i do
why i be lost you see i didnt know her then i didnt understand her i thought she wanted money and that she wouldnt forgive my poverty
and so i fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand sewed it up calculating on it sewed it up before i was drunk and after i had sewn it up i went off to get drunk on the rest
i should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have squandered it all chuckled nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov for after all what does it amount to
yes that was base do you understand now both the lawyers laughed aloud why that i stole it that what it amounts to
oh god you horrify me by not understanding every day that i had that fifteen hundred sewn up round my neck
every day and every hour i said to myself you re a thief you re a thief yes that why i ve been so savage all this month
that why i fought in the tavern that why i attacked my father_zossima it was because i felt i was a thief
i couldnt make up my mind i didnt dare even to tell alyosha_karamazov my brother about that fifteen hundred i felt i was such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket
but do you know while i carried it i said to myself at the same time every hour no dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you may yet not be a thief
and only yesterday i made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck on my way from fenya to pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin
why because i might go next day and pay back that fifteen hundred to katya i hadnt been able till that moment to bring myself to it
and it was only when i tore it off that i became a downright thief a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life
because with that i destroyed too my dream of going to katya and saying i a scoundrel but not a thief
why do you understand now do you understand what was it made you decide to do it yesterday nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov interrupted
why it absurd to ask because i had condemned myself to die at five clock this morning here at dawn
i thought it made no difference whether i died a thief or a man of honor but i see it not so
what has tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that i killed the old servant and that i was in danger of siberia just when my love was being rewarded and heaven was open to me again
oh that did torture me but not in the same way not so much as the damned consciousness that i had torn that damned money off my breast at last and spent it and had become a downright thief
it turns out that it does make a difference believe me gentlemen oh gentlemen i tell you again with a bleeding heart i have learnt a great deal this night
i have learnt that it not only impossible to live a scoundrel but impossible to die a scoundrel no gentlemen one must die honest
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was pale his face had a haggard and exhausted look in spite of his being intensely excited i am beginning to understand you dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov the prosecutor said slowly in a soft and almost compassionate tone
but all this if you ll excuse my saying so is a matter of nerves in my opinion your overwrought nerves that what it is
and why for instance should you not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month by going and returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you
and why could you not have explained things to her and in view of your position which you describe as being so awful why could you not have had recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one mind that is after honorably confessing your errors to her why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for your expenses which with her generous heart she would certainly not have refused you in your distress especially if it had been with some guarantee or even on the security you offered to the merchant mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and to madame_hohlakov
i suppose you still regard that security as of value mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly crimsoned surely you dont think me such an out and out scoundrel as that
you cant be speaking in earnest he said with indignation looking the prosecutor straight in the face and seeming unable to believe his ears
i assure you i in earnest why do you imagine i not serious it was the prosecutor turn to be surprised
oh how base that would have been gentlemen do you know you are torturing me let me tell you everything so be it
i ll confess all my infernal wickedness but to put you to shame and you ll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions can sink
yes gentlemen i too have had that thought in my mind all this current month so that i was on the point of deciding to go to katya i was mean enough for that
but to go to her to tell her of my treachery and for that very treachery to carry it out for the expenses of that treachery to beg for money from her katya to beg do you hear to beg and go straight from her to run away with the other the rival who hated and insulted her to think of it
you must know that i already had that plan myself that plan you spoke of just now prosecutor you must be mad prosecutor
i am not but i did speak in haste without thinking of that feminine jealousy if there could be jealousy in this case as you assert
mad yes perhaps there is something of the kind said the prosecutor smiling but that would have been so infamous
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov brought his fist down on the table fiercely that would have been filthy beyond everything yes do you know that she might have given me that money yes and she would have given it too
she have been certain to give it to be revenged on me she have given it to satisfy her vengeance to show her contempt for me for her is an infernal nature too and she a woman of great wrath
i have taken the money too oh i should have taken it i should have taken it and then for the rest of my life
forgive me gentlemen i making such an outcry because i ve had that thought in my mind so lately only the day before yesterday that night when i was having all that bother with lyagavy and afterwards yesterday all day yesterday i remember till that happened
oh god till what happened put in nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov inquisitively but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov did not hear it i have made you an awful confession mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov said gloomily in conclusion
you must appreciate it and what more you must respect it for if not if that leaves your soul untouched then you ve simply no respect for me gentlemen i tell you that and i shall die of shame at having confessed it to man like you
oh i shall shoot myself yes i see i see already that you dont believe me what you want to write that down too
yes what you said just now said nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov looking at him in surprise that is that up to the last hour you were still contemplating going to katerina_ivanovna to beg that sum from her
i assure you that a very important piece of evidence for us dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i mean for the whole case and particularly for you particularly important for you
he cried in dismay have mercy gentlemen mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov flung up his hands dont write that anyway have some shame
here i ve torn my heart asunder before you and you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves
dont worry yourself so dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov observed the prosecutor everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards and what you dont agree to we ll alter as you like
oh my god in despair he hid his face in his hands but now i ll ask you one little question for the second time
has no one absolutely no one heard from you of that money you sewed up that i must tell you is almost impossible to believe
very well this matter is bound to be explained and there plenty of time for it but meantime consider we have perhaps a dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad and even shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you spent here
no one no one i told you so before or you ve not understood anything let me alone three thousand not fifteen hundred
and now too when you got hold of the money you had yesterday you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you
you ve got not dozens but hundreds of witnesses two hundred witnesses two hundred have heard it thousands have heard it cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
well you see all bear witness to it and the word all means something it means nothing i talked rot and every one began repeating it
but what need had you to talk rot as you call it the devil knows from bravado perhaps at having wasted so much money
to try and forget that money i had sewn up perhaps yes that was why damn it how often will you ask me that question
well i told a fib and that was the end of it once i said it i didnt care to correct it
what does a man tell lies for sometimes that very difficult to decide dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov what makes a man tell lies observed the prosecutor impressively
tell me though was that amulet as you call it on your neck a big thing no not big how big for instance
if you fold a hundred rouble note in half that would be the size you better show us the remains of it
you must have them somewhere damnation what nonsense i dont know where they are but excuse me where and when did you take it off your neck
when i was going from fenya to pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin on the way i tore it off my neck and took out the money
according to your own evidence you didnt go home in the dark what should i want a light for
i did it with my fingers in one minute without scissors in the street in the market place i think it was
why scissors it was an old rag it was torn in a minute where did you put it afterwards i dropped it there
where was it exactly in the market place in the market place the devil knows whereabouts what do you want to know for
that extremely important dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov it would be material evidence in your favor how is it you dont understand that
who helped you to sew it up a month ago no one helped me i did it myself can you sew
a soldier has to know how to sew no knowledge was needed to do that where did you get the material that is the rag in which you sewed the money
are you laughing at me not at all and we are in no mood for laughing dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i dont know where i got the rag from somewhere i suppose
i should have thought you couldnt have forgotten it upon my word i dont remember i might have torn a bit off my linen
that very interesting we might find in your lodgings to morrow the shirt or whatever it is from which you tore the rag
what sort of rag was it cloth or linen goodness only knows what it was wait a bit i believe i didnt tear it off anything
it was a bit of calico i believe i sewed it up in a cap of my landlady in your landlady cap
yes i took it from her how did you get it you see i remember once taking a cap for a rag perhaps to wipe my pen on
i took it without asking because it was a worthless rag i tore it up and i took the notes and sewed them up in it
i believe it was in that very rag i sewed them an old piece of calico washed a thousand time
and you remember that for certain now i dont know whether for certain i think it was in the cap but hang it what does it matter
in that case your landlady will remember that the thing was lost no she wont she didnt miss it it was an old rag i tell you an old rag not worth a farthing
and where did you get the needle and thread i ll stop now i wont say any more enough of it said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov losing his temper at last
it strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw the pieces in the market place give orders for the market place to be swept to morrow and perhaps you ll find it said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sneering
enough gentlemen enough he decided in an exhausted voice i see you dont believe me not for a moment
it my fault not yours i ought not to have been so ready why why did i degrade myself by confessing my secret to you
it a joke to you i see that from your eye you led me on to it prosecutor sing a hymn of triumph if you can
damn you you torturers he bent his head and hid his face in his hands the lawyers were silent a minute later he raised his head and looked at them almost vacantly
his face now expressed complete hopeless despair and he sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was happening
in the meantime they had to finish what they were about they had immediately to begin examining the witnesses it was by now eight clock in the morning
the lights had been extinguished long ago mihail_makarovitch and pyotr_fomitch_kalganov who had been continually in and out of the room
all the while the interrogation had been going on had now both gone out again the lawyers too looked very tired
it was a wretched morning the whole sky was overcast and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov gazed blankly out of the window
may i look out of the window he asked nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov suddenly oh as much as you like the latter replied
he could see the muddy road just below the house and farther away in the rain and mist a row of poor black dismal huts looking even blacker and poorer in the rain
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov got up and went to the window the rain lashed against its little greenish panes mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov thought of phoebus the golden haired and how he had meant to shoot himself at his first ray
perhaps it would be even better on a morning like this he thought with a smile and suddenly flinging his hand downwards he turned to his torturers
gentlemen he cried i see that i am lost but she tell me about her i beseech you surely she need not be ruined with me
she innocent you know she was out of her mind when she cried last night it all my fault she done nothing nothing
i ve been grieving over her all night as i sat with you cant you wont you tell me what you are going to do with her now
you can set your mind quite at rest on that score dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov the prosecutor answered at once with evident alacrity
we have so far no grounds for interfering with the lady in whom you are so interested i trust that it may be the same in the later development of the case
on the contrary we ll do everything that lies in our power in that matter set your mind completely at rest gentlemen i thank you
i knew that you were honest straight forward people in spite of everything you ve taken a load off my heart well what are we to do now
i ready well we ought to make haste we must pass to examining the witnesses without delay that must be done in your presence and therefore
they decided that if tea were ready downstairs mihail_makarovitch had no doubt gone down to get some they would have a glass and then go on and on putting off their proper breakfast until a more favorable opportunity
shouldnt we have some tea first interposed nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov i think we ve deserved it tea really was ready below and was soon brought up
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at first refused the glass that nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov politely offered him but afterwards he asked for it himself and drank it greedily
it might have been supposed from his herculean strength that one night of carousing even accompanied by the most violent emotions could have had little effect on him
but he felt that he could hardly hold his head up and from time to time all the objects about him seemed heaving and dancing before his eye
he looked surprisingly exhausted a little more and i shall begin raving he said to himself chapter viii the evidence of the witnesses
and so we will not dwell on how nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov impressed on every witness called that he must give his evidence in accordance with truth and conscience and that he would afterwards have to repeat his evidence on oath how every witness was called upon to sign the protocol of his evidence and so on
we will only note that the point principally insisted upon in the examination was the question of the three thousand roubles that is was the sum spent here at mokroe by mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov on the first occasion a month before three thousand or fifteen hundred
the babe the examination of the witnesses began but we will not continue our story in such detail as before and again had he spent three thousand or fifteen hundred yesterday
there was not one in his favor and some witnesses introduced new almost crushing facts in contradiction of his mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov story
alas all the evidence given by every one turned out to be against mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the first witness examined was trifon_borissovitch
he had on the contrary an air of stern and severe indignation with the accused which gave him an appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity
he was not in the least abashed as he stood before the lawyers he spoke little and with reserve waited to be questioned answered precisely and deliberately
firmly and unhesitatingly he bore witness that the sum spent a month before could not have been less than three thousand that all the peasants about here would testify that they had heard the sum of three thousand mentioned by dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov himself
what a lot of money he flung away on the gypsy girls alone he wasted a thousand i daresay on them alone
i dont believe i gave them five hundred was mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov gloomy comment on this it a pity i didnt count the money at the time but i was drunk
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was sitting sideways with his back to the curtains he listened gloomily with a melancholy and exhausted air as though he would say oh say what you like
it makes no difference now more than a thousand went on them dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov retorted trifon_borissovitch firmly you flung it about at random and they picked it up
they were a rascally thievish lot horse stealers they ve been driven away from here or maybe they bear witness themselves how much they got from you
i didnt you didnt let me that true enough but by the look of it i should say it was far more than fifteen hundred
i saw the sum in your hands myself count it fifteen hundred indeed we ve seen money too we can judge of amounts
as for the sum spent yesterday he asserted that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had told him as soon as he arrived that he had brought three thousand with him
come now is that so trifon_borissovitch replied mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov surely i didnt declare so positively that i brought three thousand
and in the hall when you were treating the chorus you shouted straight out that you would leave your sixth thousand here
you did say so dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you said it before andrey andrey himself is still here send for him that is with what you spent before we must understand
stepan and semyon heard it and pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov fomitch pyotr_fomitch_kalganov too was standing beside you at the time maybe he remember it
they were delighted with this new mode of reckoning three and three made six three thousand then and three now made six that was clear
the evidence as to the sixth thousand made an extraordinary impression on the two lawyers they questioned all the peasants suggested by trifon_borissovitch stepan and semyon the driver andrey and pyotr_fomitch_kalganov
they noted down with particular care andrey account of the conversation he had had with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov on the road where says he am i dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov going to heaven or to hell and shall i be forgiven in the next world or not
the psychological ippolit_kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile and ended by recommending that these remarks as to where dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov would go should be included in the case
pyotr_fomitch_kalganov when called came in reluctantly frowning and ill humored and he spoke to the lawyers as though he had never met them before in his life though they were acquaintances whom he had been meeting every day for a long time past
the peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed trifon_borissovitch evidence he began by saying that he knew nothing about it and didnt want to
but it appeared that he had heard of the sixth thousand and he admitted that he had been standing close by at the moment
as far as he could see he didnt know how much money mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had in his hands he affirmed that the poles had cheated at cards
in reply to reiterated questions he stated that after the poles had been turned out mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov position with agrafena_alexandrovna had certainly improved and that she had said that she loved him
he spoke of agrafena_alexandrovna with reserve and respect as though she had been a lady of the best society and did not once allow himself to call her grushenka
in spite of the young man obvious repugnance at giving evidence ippolit_kirillovitch examined him at great length and only from him learnt all the details of what made up mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov romance so to say on that night
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov did not once pull pyotr_fomitch_kalganov up at last they let the young man go and he left the room with unconcealed indignation
though they had gone to bed in their room they had not slept all night and on the arrival of the police officers they hastily dressed and got ready realizing that they would certainly be sent for
the little pole turned out to be a retired official of the twelfth class who had served in siberia as a veterinary surgeon
the poles too were examined they gave their evidence with dignity though not without some uneasiness his name was mussyalovitch pan_vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificated dentist
although nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov asked them questions on entering the room they both addressed their answers to mihail_makarovitch who was standing on one side taking him in their ignorance for the most important person and in command and addressed him at every word as pan colonel
only after several reproofs from mihail_makarovitch himself they grasped that they had to address their answers to nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov only
of his relations with grushenka past and present pan mussyalovitch spoke proudly and warmly so that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was roused at once and declared that he would not allow the scoundrel to speak like that in his presence
pan mussyalovitch at once called attention to the word scoundrel and begged that it should be put down in the protocol
it turned out that they could speak russian quite correctly except for their accent in some words mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov fumed with rage
he a scoundrel a scoundrel you can put that down and put down too that in spite of the protocol i still declare that he a scoundrel
after sternly reprimanding mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he cut short all further inquiry into the romantic aspect of the case and hastened to pass to what was essential
one piece of evidence given by the poles roused special interest in the lawyers that was how in that very room mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had tried to buy off pan mussyalovitch and had offered him three thousand roubles to resign his claims seven hundred roubles down and the remaining two thousand three hundred to be paid next day in the town
he cried though nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov did insert this in the protocol he showed the most praiseworthy tact and management
he had sworn at the time that he had not the whole sum with him at mokroe but that his money was in the town
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov observed hotly that he had not said that he would be sure to pay him the remainder next day in the town
but pan_vrublevsky confirmed the statement and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov after thinking for a moment admitted frowning that it must have been as the poles stated that he had been excited at the time and might indeed have said so
it seemed to establish for the prosecution and they did in fact base this deduction on it that half or a part of the three thousand that had come into mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in the town or even perhaps somewhere here in mokroe
this would explain the circumstance so baffling for the prosecution that only eight hundred roubles were to be found in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hands
this circumstance had been the one piece of evidence which insignificant as it was had hitherto told to some extent in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov favor
the prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence now this one piece of evidence in his favor had broken down
in answer to the prosecutor inquiry where he would have got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles since he himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov confidently replied that he had meant to offer the little chap not money but a formal deed of conveyance of his rights to the village of tchermashnya those rights which he had already offered to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and madame_hohlakov
and you imagine he would have accepted such a deed as a substitute for two thousand three hundred roubles in cash
the prosecutor positively smiled at the innocence of this subterfuge he certainly would have accepted it mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov declared warmly
he would have put his lawyers poles and jews on to the job and might have got not three thousand but the whole property out of the old man
why look here he might have grabbed not two thousand but four or six for it the evidence of pan mussyalovitch was of course entered in the protocol in the fullest detail
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov was too well pleased with them as it was and did not want to worry them with trifles moreover it was nothing but a foolish drunken quarrel over cards
then they let the poles go the incident of the cheating at cards was hardly touched upon there had been drinking and disorder enough that night
so the two hundred roubles remained in the pockets of the poles then old maximov was summoned he came in timidly approached with little steps looking very disheveled and depressed
he had all this time taken refuge below with grushenka sitting dumbly beside her and now and then he begin blubbering over her and wiping his eye with a blue check handkerchief as mihail_makarovitch described afterwards
the old man at once confessed that he had done wrong that he had borrowed ten roubles in my poverty from dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and that he was ready to pay it back
to nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov direct question had he noticed how much money dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov held in his hand as he must have been able to see the sum better than any one when he took the note from him maximov in the most positive manner declared that there was twenty thousand
so that she herself began trying to pacify and comfort him have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before then
inquired nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov with a smile to be sure i have not twenty but seven when my wife mortgaged my little property
she only let me look at it from a distance boasting of it to me it was a very thick bundle all rainbow colored notes
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov was obviously apprehensive of the effect her appearance might have on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and he muttered a few words of admonition to him but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov bowed his head in silence giving him to understand that he would not make a scene
and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov were all rainbow colored he was not kept long at last it was grushenka turn mihail_makarovitch himself led grushenka in
she entered with a stern and gloomy face that looked almost composed and sat down quietly on the chair offered her by nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov
she was very pale she seemed to be cold and wrapped herself closely in her magnificent black shawl she was suffering from a slight feverish chill the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night
her grave air her direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favorable impression on every one nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov was even a little bit fascinated
he admitted himself when talking about it afterwards that only then had he seen how handsome the woman was for though he had seen her several time before he had always looked upon her as something of a provincial hetaira
but this was received with positive indignation by the lady who immediately called him a naughty man to his great satisfaction
she has the manners of the best society he said enthusiastically gossiping about her in a circle of lady as she entered the room grushenka only glanced for an instant at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov who looked at her uneasily
after the first inevitable inquiries and warnings nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov asked her hesitating a little but preserving the most courteous manner on what terms she was with the retired lieutenant dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov
but her face reassured him at once to this grushenka firmly and quietly replied he was an acquaintance he came to see me as an acquaintance during the last month
to further inquisitive questions she answered plainly and with complete frankness that though at time she had thought him attractive she had not loved him but had won his heart as well as his old father_zossima in my nasty spite that she had seen that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was very jealous of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and every one else but that had only amused her
she had never meant to go to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov she had simply been laughing at him i had no thoughts for either of them all this last month
but i think she said in conclusion that there no need for you to inquire about that nor for me to answer you for that my own affair
he again dismissed the romantic aspect of the case and passed to the serious one that is to the question of most importance concerning the three thousand roubles
grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first carousal at mokroe and though she had not counted the money herself she had heard that it was three thousand from dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov own lips
did he tell you that alone or before some one else or did you only hear him speak of it to others in your presence
i was expecting another man who had wronged me nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov immediately acted upon this hint the prosecutor inquired immediately
to which grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other people and had heard him say so when they were alone
did he say it to you alone once or several time inquired the prosecutor and learned that he had told grushenka so several time
further examination elicited that grushenka knew too where that money had come from and that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had got it from katerina_ivanovna
and did you never once hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand but less and that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had saved half that sum for his own use
ippolit_kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence no i never heard that answered grushenka it was explained further that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had on the contrary often told her that he hadnt a farthing
did he never say before you casually or in a moment of irritation nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov put in suddenly that he intended to make an attempt on his father_zossima life
he was always expecting to get some from his father_zossima said grushenka in conclusion ach he did say so sighed grushenka
once or several time he mentioned it several time always in anger and did you believe he would do it
no i never believed it she answered firmly i had faith in his noble heart gentlemen allow me cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly allow me to say one word to agrafena_alexandrovna in your presence
you can speak nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov assented agrafena_alexandrovna mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov got up from his chair have faith in god and in me
i am not guilty of my father_zossima murder having uttered these words mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sat down again on his chair grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon
thanks be to thee lord she said in a voice thrilled with emotion and still standing she turned to nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov and added as he has spoken now believe it
i know him he ll say anything as a joke or from obstinacy but he ll never deceive you against his conscience he telling the whole truth you may believe it
as to the money spent the previous day she declared that she did not know what sum it was but had heard him tell several people that he had three thousand with him
and to the question where he got the money she said that he had told her that he had stolen it from katerina_ivanovna and that she had replied to that that he hadnt stolen it and that he must pay the money back next day
on the prosecutor asking her emphatically whether the money he said he had stolen from katerina_ivanovna was what he had spent yesterday or what he had squandered here a month ago she declared that he meant the money spent a month ago and that that was how she understood him
grushenka was at last released and nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov informed her impulsively that she might at once return to the town and
that if he could be of any assistance to her with horses for example or if she would care for an escort he would be
i thank you sincerely said grushenka bowing to him i going with this old gentleman i am driving him back to town with me and meanwhile if you ll allow me i ll wait below to hear what you decide about dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
thanks agrafena_alexandrovna you ve given me fresh courage mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov responded in a quivering voice she went out mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was calm and even looked more cheerful but only for a moment
he felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness his eye were closing with fatigue the examination of the witnesses was at last over
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov got up moved from his chair to the corner by the curtain lay down on a large chest covered with a rug and instantly fell asleep
they proceeded to a final revision of the protocol he had a strange dream utterly out of keeping with the place and the time
he was driving somewhere in the steppes where he had been stationed long ago and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses through snow and sleet
he was cold it was early in november and the snow was falling in big wet flakes melting as soon as it touched the earth
and the peasant drove him smartly he had a fair long beard he was not an old man somewhere about fifty and he had on a gray peasant smock
not far off was a village he could see the black huts and half the huts were burnt down there were only the charred beams sticking up
and as they drove in there were peasant women drawn up along the road a lot of women a whole row all thin and wan with their faces a sort of brownish color especially one at the edge a tall bony woman who looked forty but might have been only twenty with a long thin face
and in her arms was a little baby crying and her breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in them
and the child cried and cried and held out its little bare arms with its little fists blue from cold
why are they crying why are they crying mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov asked as they dashed gayly by it the babe answered the driver the babe weeping
and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was struck by his saying in his peasant way the babe and he liked the peasant calling it a babe
there seemed more pity in it but why is it weeping mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov persisted stupidly why are its little arms bare
why dont they wrap it up the babe cold its little clothes are frozen and dont warm it but why is it
why foolish mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov still persisted why they re poor people burnt out they ve no bread they re begging because they ve been burnt out
no no mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as it were still did not understand tell me why it is those poor mothers stand there why are people poor
why is the babe poor why is the steppe barren why dont they hug each other and kiss why dont they sing songs of joy
and he felt that though his questions were unreasonable and senseless yet he wanted to ask just that and he had to ask it just in that way
and he felt that a passion of pity such as he had never known before was rising in his heart that he wanted to cry that he wanted to do something for them all so that the babe should weep no more so that the dark faced dried up mother should not weep that no one should shed tears again from that moment and he wanted to do it at once at once regardless of all obstacles with all the recklessness of the karamazovs
why are they so dark from black misery why dont they feed the babe and i coming with you
i wont leave you now for the rest of my life i coming with you he heard close beside him grushenka tender voice thrilling with emotion
and his heart glowed and he struggled forward towards the light and he longed to live to live to go on and on towards the new beckoning light and to hasten hasten now at once
he exclaimed opening his eye and sitting up on the chest as though he had revived from a swoon smiling brightly
what where nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov was standing over him suggesting that he should hear the protocol read aloud and sign it
he was suddenly struck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head which hadnt been there when he had leant back exhausted on the chest
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov guessed that he had been asleep an hour or more but he did not hear nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov who put that pillow under my head
he cried with a sort of ecstatic gratitude and tears in his voice as though some great kindness had been shown him
he never found out who this kind man was perhaps one of the peasant witnesses or nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov little secretary had compassionately thought to put a pillow under his head but his whole soul was quivering with tears
i ve had a good dream gentlemen he said in a strange voice with a new light as of joy in his face
who was so kind he went to the table and said that he would sign whatever they liked chapter ix
when the protocol had been signed nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov turned solemnly to the prisoner and read him the committal setting forth that in such a year on such a day in such a place the investigating lawyer of such
and such a district court having examined so and so to wit mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov accused of this and of that all the charge were carefully written out and having considered that the accused not pleading guilty to the charge made against him had brought forward nothing in his defense while the witnesses so and so and so and so and the circumstances such and such testify against him acting in accordance with such and such articles of the statute book and so on has ruled that in order to preclude so and
so mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov from all means of evading pursuit and judgment he be detained in such and such a prison which he hereby notifies to the accused and communicates a copy of this same committal to the deputy prosecutor and so on and so on
in brief mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was informed that he was from that moment a prisoner and that he would be driven at once to the town and there shut up in a very unpleasant place
they carry mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov away mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov listened attentively and only shrugged his shoulders well gentlemen i dont blame you i ready
nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov informed him gently that he would be escorted at once by the rural police officer mavriky_mavrikyevitch who happened to be on the spot
stay mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov interrupted suddenly and impelled by uncontrollable feeling he pronounced addressing all in the room gentlemen we re all cruel we re all monsters we all make man weep and mothers and babes at the breast but of all let it be settled here now of all i am the lowest reptile
i understand that there nothing else for you to do i ve sworn to amend and every day i ve done the same filthy things
i understand now that such man as i need a blow a blow of destiny to catch them as with a noose and bind them by a force from without
i accept the torture of accusation and my public shame i want to suffer and by suffering i shall be purified
never never should i have risen of myself but the thunderbolt has fallen perhaps i shall be purified gentlemen but listen for the last time i am not guilty of my father_zossima blood
i accept my punishment not because i killed him but because i meant to kill him and perhaps i really might have killed him
still i mean to fight it out with you i warn you of that i ll fight it out with you to the end and then god will decide
good by gentlemen dont be vexed with me for having shouted at you during the examination oh i was still such a fool then
in another minute i shall be a prisoner but now for the last time as a free man dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov offers you his hand
his voice quivered and he stretched out his hand but nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov who happened to stand nearest to him with a sudden almost nervous movement hid his hands behind his back
saying good by to you i say it to all man mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov instantly noticed this and started he let his outstretched hand fall at once
we will continue it in the town and i for my part of course am ready to wish you all success in your defense
as a matter of fact dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i ve always been disposed to regard you as so to speak more unfortunate than guilty
all of us here if i may make bold to speak for all we are all ready to recognize that you are at bottom a young man of honor but alas one who has been carried away by certain passions to a somewhat excessive degree
the preliminary inquiry is not yet over nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov faltered somewhat embarrassed nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov little figure was positively majestic by the time he had finished speaking
it struck mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that in another minute this boy would take his arm lead him to another corner and renew their conversation about girls
but many quite irrelevant and inappropriate thoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner when he is being led out to execution
gentlemen you are good you are humane may i see her to say good by for the last time asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
certainly but considering in fact now it impossible except in the presence of oh well if it must be so it must
grushenka was brought in but the farewell was brief and of few words and did not at all satisfy nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov
grushenka made a deep bow to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i have told you i am yours and i will be yours
i will follow you for ever wherever they may send you farewell you are guiltless though you ve been your own undoing
her lips quivered tears flowed from her eye forgive me grusha for my love for ruining you too with my love
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov would have said something more but he broke off and went out he was at once surrounded by man who kept a constant watch on him
at the bottom of the steps to which he had driven up with such a dash the day before with andrey three horses two carts stood in readiness
mavriky_mavrikyevitch a sturdy thick set man with a wrinkled face was annoyed about something some sudden irregularity he was shouting angrily
when i stood him drinks in the tavern the man had quite a different face thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as he got in
he asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness at the gates there was a crowd of people peasants women and drivers
trifon_borissovitch came down the steps too all stared at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov forgive me at parting good people mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov shouted suddenly from the cart
forgive us too he heard two or three voices good by to you too trifon_borissovitch but trifon_borissovitch did not even turn round
it appeared that everything was not yet ready in the second cart in which two constables were to accompany mavriky_mavrikyevitch
the peasant who had been ordered to drive the second cart was pulling on his smock stoutly maintaining that it was not his turn to go but akim
he was perhaps too busy he too was shouting and fussing about something but akim was not to be seen they ran to look for him
the peasant persisted and besought them to wait you see what our peasants are mavriky_mavrikyevitch they ve no shame exclaimed trifon_borissovitch
akim gave you twenty five copecks the day before yesterday you ve drunk it all and now you cry out i simply surprised at your good nature with our low peasants mavriky_mavrikyevitch that all i can say
but what do we want a second cart for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov put in let start with the one mavriky_mavrikyevitch
i wont be unruly i wont run away from you old fellow what do we want an escort for i ll trouble you sir to learn how to speak to me if you ve never been taught
i not old fellow to you and you can keep your advice for another time mavriky_mavrikyevitch snapped out savagely as though glad to vent his wrath
the rain had ceased but the dull sky was still overcast with clouds and a keen wind was blowing straight in his face
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was reduced to silence he flushed all over a moment later he felt suddenly very cold i ve taken a chill thought mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov twitching his shoulders
at last mavriky_mavrikyevitch too got into the cart sat down heavily and as though without noticing it squeezed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov into the corner
it is true that he was out of humor and greatly disliked the task that had been laid upon him
good by trifon_borissovitch mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov shouted again and felt himself that he had not called out this time from good nature but involuntarily from resentment
but trifon_borissovitch stood proudly with both hands behind his back and staring straight at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with a stern and angry face he made no reply
good by dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov good by he heard all at once the voice of pyotr_fomitch_kalganov who had suddenly darted out running up to the cart he held out his hand to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
he had no cap on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had time to seize and press his hand good by dear fellow i shant forget your generosity he cried warmly
pyotr_fomitch_kalganov ran back sat down in a corner bent his head hid his face in his hands and burst out crying
for a long while he sat like that crying as though he were a little boy instead of a young man of twenty
but the cart moved and their hands parted the bell began ringing and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was driven off oh he believed almost without doubt in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov guilt
what are these people what can man be after this he exclaimed incoherently in bitter despondency almost despair at that moment he had no desire to live
is it worth it is it worth it exclaimed the boy in his grief part iv book the boys chapter i kolya_krassotkin
there had been a hard frost eleven degrees réaumur without snow but a little dry snow had fallen on the frozen ground during the night and a keen dry wind was lifting and blowing it along the dreary streets of our town especially about the market place
it was the beginning of november it was a dull morning but the snow had ceased not far from the market place close to plotnikov shop there stood a small house very clean both without and within
it belonged to madame kolya_krassotkin the widow of a former provincial secretary who had been dead for fourteen years his widow still a nice looking woman of thirty two was living in her neat little house on her private means
she was about eighteen at the time of her husband death she had been married only a year and had just borne him a son
from the day of his death she had devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her precious treasure her boy kolya_krassotkin
she lived in respectable seclusion she was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition though she had loved him passionately those fourteen years he had caused her far more suffering than happiness
she had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day afraid he would fall ill would catch cold do something naughty climb on a chair and fall off it and so on and so on
when kolya_krassotkin began going to school the mother devoted herself to studying all the sciences with him so as to help him and go through his lessons with him
she hastened to make the acquaintance of the teachers and their wives even made up to kolya_krassotkin schoolfellows and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving kolya_krassotkin from being teased laughed at or beaten by them
she went so far that the boys actually began to mock at him on her account and taunt him with being a mother darling
he was a resolute boy tremendously strong as was rumored in his class and soon proved to be the fact he was agile strong willed and of an audacious and enterprising temper
he was good at lessons and there was a rumor in the school that he could beat the teacher dardanelov at arithmetic and universal history
but the boy could take his own part though he looked down upon every one he was a good comrade and not supercilious
he accepted his schoolfellows respect as his due but was friendly with them above all he knew where to draw the line
he could restrain himself on occasion and in his relations with the teachers he never overstepped that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breach of discipline
but he was as fond of mischief on every possible occasion as the smallest boy in the school and not so much for the sake of mischief as for creating a sensation inventing something something effective and conspicuous
he knew how to make even his mother give way to him he was almost despotic in his control of her
he was extremely vain she gave way to him oh she had given way to him for years the one thought unendurable to her was that her boy had no great love for her
she was always fancying that kolya_krassotkin was unfeeling to her and at time dissolving into hysterical tears she used to reproach him with his coldness
the boy disliked this and the more demonstrations of feeling were demanded of him the more he seemed intentionally to avoid them
yet it was not intentional on his part but instinctive it was his character his mother was mistaken he was very fond of her
he only disliked sheepish sentimentality as he expressed it in his schoolboy language there was a bookcase in the house containing a few book that had been his father_zossima
his mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes at seeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book instead of going to play
kolya_krassotkin was fond of reading and had read several of them by himself and in that way kolya_krassotkin read some things unsuitable for his age
though the boy as a rule knew where to draw the line in his mischief he had of late begun to play pranks that caused his mother serious alarm
it happened that july during the summer holidays that the mother and son went to another district forty five miles away to spend a week with a distant relation whose husband was an official at the railway station the very station the nearest one to our town from which a month later ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov set off for moscow
there kolya_krassotkin began by carefully investigating every detail connected with the railways knowing that he could impress his schoolfellows when he got home with his newly acquired knowledge
it is true there was nothing vicious in what he did but a wild mad recklessness but there happened to be some other boys in the place with whom he soon made friends
some of them were living at the station others in the neighborhood there were six or seven of them all between twelve and fifteen and two of them came from our town
the boys played together and on the fourth or fifth day of kolya_krassotkin stay at the station a mad bet was made by the foolish boys
kolya_krassotkin who was almost the youngest of the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence was moved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he would lie down between the rails at night when the eleven clock train was due and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over him at full speed
it is true they made a preliminary investigation from which it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between the rails that the train could pass over without touching but to lie there was no joke
kolya_krassotkin maintained stoutly that he would at first they laughed at him called him a little liar a braggart but that only egged him on
what piqued him most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses at him too superciliously and were at first disposed to treat him as a small boy not fit to associate with them and that was an unendurable insult
and so it was resolved to go in the evening half a mile from the station so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the station
the boys assembled it was a pitch dark night without a moon at the time fixed kolya_krassotkin lay down between the rails
the five others who had taken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment their hearts beating with suspense which was followed by alarm and remorse
at last they heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station two red lights gleamed out of the darkness the monster roared as it approached
run run away from the rails the boys cried to kolya_krassotkin from the bushes breathless with terror but it was too late the train darted up and flew past
the boys rushed to kolya_krassotkin he lay without moving they began pulling at him lifting him up he suddenly got up and walked away without a word
then he explained that he had lain there as though he were insensible to frighten them but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness as he confessed long after to his mother
in this way his reputation as a desperate character was established for ever he returned home to the station as white as a sheet
next day he had a slight attack of nervous fever but he was in high spirits and well pleased with himself
the incident did not become known at once but when they came back to the town it penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of the master
but then kolya_krassotkin mother hastened to entreat the master on her boy behalf and in the end dardanelov a respected and influential teacher exerted himself in his favor and the affair was ignored
dardanelov was a middle aged bachelor who had been passionately in love with madame kolya_krassotkin for many years past and had once already about a year previously ventured trembling with fear and the delicacy of his sentiments to offer her most respectfully his hand in marriage
but she refused him resolutely feeling that to accept him would be an act of treachery to her son though dardanelov had to judge from certain mysterious symptoms reason for believing that he was not an object of aversion to the charming but too chaste and tender hearted widow
kolya_krassotkin mad prank seemed to have broken the ice and dardanelov was rewarded for his intercession by a suggestion of hope
the suggestion it is true was a faint one but then dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and delicacy that it was enough for the time being to make him perfectly happy
he was fond of the boy though he would have felt it beneath him to try and win him over and was severe and strict with him in class
he learned his lessons perfectly he was second in his class was reserved with dardanelov and the whole class firmly believed that kolya_krassotkin was so good at universal history that he could beat even dardanelov
kolya_krassotkin did indeed ask him the question who founded troy to which dardanelov had made a very vague reply referring to the movements and migrations of races to the remoteness of the period to the mythical legends
but the question who had founded troy that is what individuals he could not answer and even for some reason regarded the question as idle and frivolous
kolya_krassotkin too kept him at a respectful distance but the boys remained convinced that dardanelov did not know who founded troy
in the end all the boys became interested in the question who it was that had founded troy but kolya_krassotkin would not tell his secret and his reputation for knowledge remained unshaken
kolya_krassotkin had read of the founders of troy in smaragdov whose history was among the book in his father_zossima bookcase after the incident on the railway a certain change came over kolya_krassotkin attitude to his mother
she had such terrible attacks of hysterics lasting with interval for several day that kolya_krassotkin seriously alarmed at last promised on his honor that such pranks should never be repeated
he swore on his knees before the holy image and swore by the memory of his father_zossima at madame kolya_krassotkin instance and the manly kolya_krassotkin burst into tears like a boy of six
when anna fyodorovna madame kolya_krassotkin heard of her son exploit she almost went out of her mind with horror and all that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other arms sobbing
next day kolya_krassotkin woke up as unfeeling as before but he had become more silent more modest sterner and more thoughtful
six weeks later it is true he got into another scrape which even brought his name to the ears of our justice of the peace but it was a scrape of quite another kind amusing foolish and he did not as it turned out take the leading part in it but was only implicated in it
but of this later his mother still fretted and trembled but the more uneasy she became the greater were the hopes of dardanelov
it must be noted that kolya_krassotkin understood and divined what was in dardanelov heart and of course despised him profoundly for his feeling he had in the past been so tactless as to show this contempt before his mother hinting vaguely that he knew what dardanelov was after
but from the time of the railway incident his behavior in this respect also was changed he did not allow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more respectfully of dardanelov before his mother which the sensitive woman at once appreciated with boundless gratitude
but at the slightest mention of dardanelov by a visitor in kolya_krassotkin presence she would flush as pink as a rose
at such moments kolya_krassotkin would either stare out of the window scowling or would investigate the state of his boots or would shout angrily for perezvon the big shaggy mangy dog which he had picked up a month before brought home and kept for some reason secretly indoors not showing him to any of his schoolfellows
he bullied him frightfully teaching him all sort of tricks so that the poor dog howled for him whenever he was absent at school and when he came in whined with delight rushed about as if he were crazy begged lay down on the ground pretending to be dead and so on in fact showed all the tricks he had taught him not at the word of command but simply from the zeal of his excited and grateful heart
i have forgotten by the way to mention that kolya_krassotkin was the boy stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as the son of captain snegiryov
ilusha had been defending his father_zossima when the schoolboys jeered at him shouting the nickname wisp of tow chapter ii
child and so on that frosty snowy and windy day in november kolya_krassotkin was sitting at home it was sunday and there was no school
it had just struck eleven and he particularly wanted to go out on very urgent business but he was left alone in charge of the house for it so happened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a sudden and singular event
madame kolya_krassotkin had let two little rooms separated from the rest of the house by a passage to a doctor wife with her two small child
her husband the doctor had taken his departure twelve months before going first to orenburg and then to tashkend and for the last six months she had not heard a word from him
had it not been for her friendship with madame kolya_krassotkin which was some consolation to the forsaken lady she would certainly have completely dissolved away in tears
and now to add to her misfortunes katerina_ivanovna her only servant was suddenly moved the evening before to announce to her mistress amazement that she proposed to bring a child into the world before morning
this lady was the same age as anna fyodorovna and a great friend of her it seemed almost miraculous to every one that no one had noticed the probability of it before
the astounded doctor wife decided to move katerina_ivanovna while there was still time to an establishment in the town kept by a midwife for such emergencies
by the morning all madame kolya_krassotkin friendly sympathy and energy were called upon to render assistance and appeal to some one for help in the case
so both the lady were absent from home the krassotkins servant agafya_ivanovna had gone out to the market and kolya_krassotkin was thus left for a time to protect and look after the kids that is the son and daughter of the doctor wife who were left alone
kolya_krassotkin was not afraid of taking care of the house besides he had perezvon who had been told to lie flat without moving under the bench in the hall
every time kolya_krassotkin walking to and fro through the rooms came into the hall the dog shook his head and gave two loud and insinuating taps on the floor with his tail but alas
as she set great store by her servant she promptly carried out this plan and remained there looking after her the whistle did not sound to release him
kolya_krassotkin looked sternly at the luckless dog who relapsed again into obedient rigidity the one thing that troubled kolya_krassotkin was the kids
he looked of course with the utmost scorn on katerina_ivanovna unexpected adventure but he was very fond of the bereaved kiddies and had already taken them a picture book
nastya the elder a girl of eight could read and kostya the boy aged seven was very fond of being read to by her
he could have made them stand side by side and played soldiers with them or sent them hiding all over the house
he had done so more than once before and was not above doing it so much so that a report once spread at school that kolya_krassotkin played horses with the little lodgers at home prancing with his head on one side like a trace horse
but kolya_krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust pointing out that to play horses with boys of one own age boys of thirteen would certainly be disgraceful at this date but that he did it for the sake of the kids because he liked them and no one had a right to call him to account for his feeling
kolya_krassotkin could of course have provided more diverting entertainment for them the two kids adored him but on this occasion he was in no mood for games
he had very important business of his own before him something almost mysterious meanwhile time was passing and agafya_ivanovna with whom he could have left the child would not come back from market
he had several time already crossed the passage opened the door of the lodgers room and looked anxiously at the kids who were sitting over the book as he had bidden them
every time he opened the door they grinned at him hoping he would come in and would do something delightful and amusing
at last it struck eleven and he made up his mind once for all that if that damned agafya_ivanovna did not come back within ten minutes he should go out without waiting for her making the kids promise of course to be brave when he was away not to be naughty not to cry from fright
with this idea he put on his wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar slung his satchel round his shoulder and regardless of his mother constantly reiterated entreaty that he would always put on goloshes in such cold weather he looked at them contemptuously as he crossed the hall and went out with only his boots on
but kolya_krassotkin was bothered and did not go in perezvon seeing him in his outdoor clothes began tapping nervously yet vigorously on the floor with his tail
but kolya_krassotkin seeing his dog passionate excitement decided that it was a breach of discipline kept him for another minute under the bench and only when he had opened the door into the passage whistled for him
twitching all over he even uttered a plaintive whine the dog leapt up like a mad creature and rushed bounding before him rapturously
kolya_krassotkin opened the door to peep at the kids they were both sitting as before at the table not reading but warmly disputing about something
the child often argued together about various exciting problems of life and nastya being the elder always got the best of it
if kostya did not agree with her he almost always appealed to kolya_krassotkin and his verdict was regarded as infallible by both of them
this time the kids discussion rather interested kolya_krassotkin and he stood still in the passage to listen the child saw he was listening and that made them dispute with even greater energy
i shall never never believe nastya prattled that the old women find babies among the cabbages in the kitchen garden it winter now and there are no cabbages
and so the old woman couldnt have taken katerina_ivanovna a daughter kolya_krassotkin whistled to himself or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere but only to those who are married
kostya stared at nastya and listened pondering profoundly nastya how silly you are he said at last firmly and calmly
how can katerina_ivanovna have a baby when she isnt married nastya was exasperated you know nothing about it she snapped irritably
perhaps she has a husband only he is in prison so now she got a baby but is her husband in prison the matter of fact kostya inquired gravely
she hasnt a husband you are right there but she wants to be married and so she been thinking of getting married and thinking and thinking of it till now
or i tell you what nastya interrupted impulsively completely rejecting and forgetting her first hypothesis she got it that is not a husband but a baby
well perhaps so kostya agreed entirely vanquished but you didnt say so before so how could i tell
come kiddies said kolya_krassotkin stepping into the room you re terrible people i see and perezvon with you grinned kostya and began snapping his fingers and calling perezvon
i am in a difficulty kids kolya_krassotkin began solemnly and you must help me agafya_ivanovna must have broken her leg since she has not turned up till now that certain
i must go out will you let me go the child looked anxiously at one another their smiling faces showed signs of uneasiness but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected of them
you wont be naughty while i am gone you wont climb on the cupboard and break your legs you wont be frightened alone and cry
a look of profound despondency came into the child faces and i could show you something as a reward a little copper cannon which can be fired with real gunpowder
the child faces instantly brightened show us the cannon said kostya beaming all over kolya_krassotkin put his hand in his satchel and pulling out a little bronze cannon stood it on the table
ah you are bound to ask that look it on wheels he rolled the toy on along the table
and it can be fired off too it can be loaded with shot and fired off and it could kill any one
it can kill any one you ve only got to aim at anybody and kolya_krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put where the shot should be rolled in showing a tiny hole like a touch hole and told them that it kicked when it was fired
the child listened with intense interest what particularly struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked and have you got any powder
nastya inquired yes show us the powder too she drawled with a smile of entreaty kolya_krassotkin dived again into his satchel and pulled out a small flask containing a little real gunpowder
he had some shot too in a screw of paper he even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palm of his hand
one has to be careful there no fire about or it would blow up and kill us all kolya_krassotkin warned them sensationally
the child gazed at the powder with an awe stricken alarm that only intensified their enjoyment but kostya liked the shot better
and does the shot burn he inquired no it doesnt give me a little shot he asked in an imploring voice
i ll give you a little shot here take it but dont show it to your mother till i come back or she ll be sure to think it gunpowder and will die of fright and give you a thrashing
mother never does whip us nastya observed at once i know i only said it to finish the sentence
and dont you ever deceive your mother except just this once until i come back and so kiddies can i go out
you wont be frightened and cry when i gone we sha all cry drawled kostya on the verge of tears already
we shall cry we shall be sure to cry nastya chimed in with timid haste oh child child how fraught with peril are your years
there no help for it chickens i shall have to stay with you i dont know how long and time is passing time is passing oogh
tell perezvon to pretend to be dead kostya begged there no help for it we must have recourse to perezvon
ici perezvon and kolya_krassotkin began giving orders to the dog who performed all his tricks he was a rough haired dog of medium size with a coat of a sort of lilac gray color
he whined and jumped stood and walked on his hind legs lay on his back with his paws in the air rigid as though he were dead
while this last performance was going on the door opened and agafya_ivanovna madame kolya_krassotkin servant a stout woman of forty marked with small pox appeared in the doorway
he was blind in his right eye and his left ear was torn she had come back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her hand
though kolya_krassotkin had been so anxious for her return he did not cut short the performance and after keeping perezvon dead for the usual time at last he whistled to him
holding up the bag of provisions in her left hand she stood still to watch the dog the dog jumped up and began bounding about in his joy at having done his duty
only think a dog agafya_ivanovna observed sententiously why are you late female asked kolya_krassotkin sternly female indeed
what is it to you if i late if i late you may be sure i have good reason muttered agafya_ivanovna busying herself about the stove without a trace of anger or displeasure in her voice
go on with you you brat brat yes a brat she seemed quite pleased in fact to enjoy a skirmish with her merry young master
listen you frivolous young woman kolya_krassotkin began getting up from the sofa can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and something else besides that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence
i am going out and what am i going to swear for laughed agafya_ivanovna i shall look after them without that
no you must swear on your eternal salvation else i shant go well dont then what does it matter to me
kids kolya_krassotkin turned to the child this woman will stay with you till i come back or till your mother comes for she ought to have been back long ago
it cold out stay at home she will give you some lunch too you ll give them something agafya_ivanovna wont you that i can do
and you granny he added gravely in an undertone as he passed agafya_ivanovna i hope you ll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your old woman nonsense about katerina_ivanovna
good by chickens i go with my heart at rest ici perezvon get along with you retorted agafya_ivanovna really angry this time
ridiculous boy you want a whipping for saying such things that what you want chapter iii the schoolboy but kolya_krassotkin did not hear her
as he went out at the gate he looked round him shrugged up his shoulders and saying it is freezing went straight along the street and turned off to the right towards the market place
when he reached the last house but one before the market place he stopped at the gate pulled a whistle out of his pocket and whistled with all his might as though giving a signal
he had not to wait more than a minute before a rosy cheeked boy of about eleven wearing a warm neat and even stylish coat darted out to meet him
at last he could go out this was smurov a boy in the preparatory class two classes below kolya_krassotkin son of a well to do official
apparently he was forbidden by his parents to associate with kolya_krassotkin who was well known to be a desperately naughty boy so smurov was obviously slipping out on the sly
he was if the reader has not forgotten one of the group of boys who two months before had thrown stones at ilusha
he was the one who told alyosha_karamazov about ilusha i ve been waiting for you for the last hour kolya_krassotkin said smurov stolidly and the boys strode towards the market place
i am late answered kolya_krassotkin i was detained by circumstances you wont be thrashed for coming with me come i say i never thrashed
and you ve got perezvon with you yes you re taking him too yes ah if it were only zhutchka that impossible
zhutchka non existent zhutchka is lost in the mists of obscurity ah couldnt we do this smurov suddenly stood still you see ilusha says that zhutchka was a shaggy grayish smoky looking dog like perezvon
couldnt you tell him this is zhutchka and he might believe you boy shun a lie that one thing even with a good object that another
above all i hope you ve not told them anything about my coming heaven forbid i know what i am about
you know his father_zossima the captain the wisp of tow told us that he was going to bring him a real mastiff pup with a black nose to day
but you wont comfort him with perezvon said smurov with a sigh he thinks that would comfort ilusha but i doubt it
and how is ilusha ah he is bad very bad i believe he in consumption he is quite conscious but his breathing
his breathing gone wrong the other day he asked to have his boots on to be led round the room he tried to walk but he couldnt stand
ah i told you before father_zossima he said that those boots were no good i could never walk properly in them
he fancied it was his boots that made him stagger but it was simply weakness really he wont live another week
herzenstube is looking after him now they are rich again they ve got heaps of money they are rogues who are rogues
doctors and the whole crew of quacks collectively and also of course individually i dont believe in medicine it a useless institution
i mean to go into all that but what that sentimentality you ve got up there the whole class seems to be there every day
not the whole class it only ten of our fellows who go to see him every day there nothing in that
his brother going to be tried to morrow or next day for such a crime and yet he has so much time to spend on sentimentality with boys
what i dont understand in all this is the part that alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov is taking in it there no sentimentality about it
you are going yourself now to make it up with ilusha make it up with him what an absurd expression
but i allow no one to analyze my actions and how pleased ilusha will be to see you he has no idea that you are coming
why was it why was it you wouldnt come all this time smurov cried with sudden warmth my dear boy that my business not yours
i am going of myself because i choose to but you ve all been hauled there by alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov there a difference you know
and how do you know i may not be going to make it up at all it a stupid expression
it not alyosha_karamazov at all it not his doing our fellows began going there of themselves of course they went with alyosha_karamazov at first
and there been nothing of that sort no silliness first one went and then another his father_zossima was awfully pleased to see us
you know he will simply go out of his mind if ilusha dies he sees that ilusha dying and he seems so glad we ve made it up with ilusha
ilusha asked after you that was all he just asks and says no more his father_zossima will go out of his mind or hang himself
he behaved like a madman before you know he is a very decent man we made a mistake then it all the fault of that murderer who beat him then
alyosha_karamazov a riddle to me all the same i might have made his acquaintance long ago but i like to have a proper pride in some cases
besides i have a theory about him which i must work out and verify kolya_krassotkin subsided into dignified silence smurov too was silent
smurov of course worshiped kolya_krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on a level with him now he was tremendously interested at kolya_krassotkin saying that he was going of himself to see ilusha
he felt that there must be some mystery in kolya_krassotkin suddenly taking it into his head to go to him that day
they crossed the market place in which at that hour were many loaded wagons from the country and a great number of live fowls
the market women were selling rolls cottons and threads etc in their booths these sunday markets were naďvely called fairs in the town and there were many such fairs in the year
perezvon ran about in the wildest spirits sniffing about first one side then the other when he met other dogs they zealously smelt each other over according to the rules of canine etiquette
i like to watch such realistic scenes smurov said kolya_krassotkin suddenly have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they meet
it seems to be a law of their nature yes it a funny habit no it not funny you are wrong there
if dogs could reason and criticize us they be sure to find just as much that would be funny to them if not far more in the social relations of man their master far more indeed
there nothing funny in nature however funny it may seem to man with his prejudices i repeat that because i am convinced that there is far more foolishness among us
that when all are equal and all have property in common there are no marriage and every one has any religion and laws he likes best and all the rest of it
that mr_rakitin idea a remarkable idea i am a socialist smurov and what is a socialist asked smurov you are not old enough to understand that yet
have you noticed smurov that in the middle of winter we dont feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do now in the beginning of winter when there is a sudden frost of twelve degrees especially when there is not much snow
it cold though yes twelve degrees of frost father_zossima looked at the thermometer just now it because people are not used to it
everything is habit with man everything even in their social and political relations habit is the great motive power what a funny looking peasant
kolya_krassotkin pointed to a tall peasant with a good natured countenance in a long sheepskin coat who was standing by his wagon clapping together his hands in their shapeless leather gloves to warm them
his long fair beard was all white with frost that peasant beard frozen kolya_krassotkin cried in a loud provocative voice as he passed him
lots of people beards are frozen the peasant replied calmly and sententiously dont provoke him observed smurov it all right he wont be cross he a nice fellow
good by matvey good by is your name matvey yes didnt you know no i didnt it was a guess
you dont say so you are a schoolboy i suppose yes you get whipped i expect nothing to speak of sometimes
does it hurt well yes it does ech what a life the peasant heaved a sigh from the bottom of his heart
good by matvey good by you are a nice chap that you are the boys went on that was a nice peasant kolya_krassotkin observed to smurov
i like talking to the peasants and am always glad to do them justice why did you tell a lie pretending we are thrashed asked smurov
i had to say that to please him how do you mean you know smurov i dont like being asked the same thing twice
i like people to understand at the first word some things cant be explained according to a peasant notions schoolboys are whipped and must be whipped
what would a schoolboy be if he were not whipped and if i were to tell him we are not he be disappointed
but you dont understand that one has to know how to talk to the peasants only dont tease them please or you ll get into another scrape as you did about that goose
so you re afraid dont laugh kolya_krassotkin of course i afraid my father_zossima would be awfully cross i am strictly forbidden to go out with you
dont be uneasy nothing will happen this time hallo natasha he shouted to a market woman in one of the booths
call me natasha what next my name is marya_kondratyevna the middle aged market woman shouted at him i am so glad it marya_kondratyevna
good by ah you young rascal a brat like you to carry on so i in a hurry i cant stay now
you shall tell me next sunday kolya_krassotkin waved his hand at her as though she had attacked him and not he her
i ve nothing to tell you next sunday you set upon me you impudent young monkey i didnt say anything bawled marya_kondratyevna
you want a whipping that what you want you saucy jackanapes there was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her
he was a young man not a native of the town with dark curly hair and a long pale face marked with smallpox
suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops close by he wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap and looked like a merchant clerk
he was in a state of stupid excitement and brandished his fist at kolya_krassotkin i know you he cried angrily i know you
kolya_krassotkin stared at him he could not recall when he could have had a row with the man but he had been in so many rows in the street that he could hardly remember them all
do you he asked sarcastically i know you i know you the man repeated idiotically so much the better for you
well it time i was going good by you are at your saucy pranks again cried the man you are at your saucy pranks again
i know you are at it again it not your business brother if i am at my saucy pranks again said kolya_krassotkin standing still and scanning him
not my business no it not your business whose then whose then whose then it trifon_borissovitch nikititch business not yours
what trifon_borissovitch nikititch asked the youth staring with loutish amazement at kolya_krassotkin but still as angry as ever kolya_krassotkin scanned him gravely
have you been to the church_of_christ of the ascension he suddenly asked him with stern emphasis what church_of_christ of ascension
what for no i havent said the young man somewhat taken aback do you know sabaneyev kolya_krassotkin went on even more emphatically and even more severely
well then you can go to the devil said kolya_krassotkin cutting short the conversation and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not even know sabaneyev
what sabaneyev no i dont know him stop heigh what sabaneyev the young man recovered from his momentary stupefaction and was as excited as before
what did he say he turned to the market women with a silly stare the women laughed you can never tell what he after said one of them
what sabaneyev is it he talking about the young man repeated still furious and brandishing his right arm
it must be a sabaneyev who worked for the kuzmitchovs that who it must be one of the women suggested the young man stared at her wildly
for the kuzmitchovs repeated another woman but his name wasnt trifon_borissovitch his name mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov not trifon_borissovitch but the boy said trifon_borissovitch nikititch so it cant be the same
his name is not trifon_borissovitch and not sabaneyev it tchizhov put in suddenly a third woman who had hitherto been silent listening gravely
alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivanitch is his name tchizhov alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivanitch not a doubt about it it tchizhov a fourth woman emphatically confirmed the statement
the bewildered youth gazed from one to another but what did he ask for what did he ask for good people
he cried almost in desperation do you know sabaneyev says he and who the devil to know who is sabaneyev
you re a senseless fellow i tell you it not sabaneyev but tchizhov alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivanitch tchizhov that who it is one of the women shouted at him impressively
what tchizhov who is he tell me if you know that tall sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer
and what your tchizhov to do with me good people eh how can i tell what he to do with you
put in another you ought to know yourself what you want with him if you make such a clamor about him
he spoke to you he did not speak to us you stupid dont you really know him know whom tchizhov
the devil take tchizhov and you with him i ll give him a hiding that i will he was laughing at me
will give tchizhov a hiding more likely he will give you one you are a fool that what you are not tchizhov not tchizhov you spiteful mischievous woman
i ll give the boy a hiding catch him catch him he was laughing at me the woman guffawed but kolya_krassotkin was by now a long way off marching along with a triumphant air
smurov walked beside him looking round at the shouting group far behind he too was in high spirits though he was still afraid of getting into some scrape in kolya_krassotkin company
what sabaneyev did you mean he asked kolya_krassotkin foreseeing what his answer would be how do i know
now there ll be a hubbub among them all day i like to stir up fools in every class of society there another blockhead that peasant there
you know they say there no one stupider than a stupid frenchman but a stupid russian shows it in his face just as much
cant you see it all over his face that he is a fool that peasant eh let him alone kolya_krassotkin let go on
a sturdy looking peasant with a round simple face and grizzled beard who was walking by raised his head and looked at the boy
nothing could stop me now i am once off hey good morning peasant he seemed not quite sober good morning if you are not laughing at me he said deliberately in reply
and if i am laughed kolya_krassotkin well a joke a joke laugh away i dont mind there no harm in a joke
i beg your pardon brother it was a joke well god forgive you do you forgive me too i quite forgive you
go along i say you seem a clever peasant cleverer than you the peasant answered unexpectedly with the same gravity
i doubt it said kolya_krassotkin somewhat taken aback it true though perhaps it is it is brother good by peasant
good by there are all sort of peasants kolya_krassotkin observed to smurov after a brief silence how could i tell i had hit on a clever one
the boys made haste and they walked as far as captain snegiryov lodging a considerable distance quickly and almost in silence
twenty paces from the house kolya_krassotkin stopped and told smurov to go on ahead and ask alyosha_karamazov to come out to him
i am always ready to recognize intelligence in the peasantry in the distance the cathedral clock struck half past eleven
one must sniff round a bit first he observed to smurov why ask him to come out smurov protested
you go in they will be awfully glad to see you what the sense of making friends in the frost out here
i know why i want to see him out here in the frost kolya_krassotkin cut him short in the despotic tone he was fond of adopting with small boys and smurov ran to do his bidding
chapter iv the lost dog kolya_krassotkin leaned against the fence with an air of dignity waiting for alyosha_karamazov to appear yes he had long wanted to meet him
he had heard a great deal about him from the boys but hitherto he had always maintained an appearance of disdainful indifference when he was mentioned and he had even criticized what he heard about alyosha_karamazov
but secretly he had a great longing to make his acquaintance there was something sympathetic and attractive in all he was told about alyosha_karamazov
so the present moment was important to begin with he had to show himself at his best to show his independence or he ll think of me as thirteen and take me for a boy like the rest of them
and what are these boys to him i shall ask him when i get to know him it a pity i am so short though
tuzikov is younger than i am yet he is half a head taller but i have a clever face i am not good looking
i know i hideous but i ve a clever face i mustnt talk too freely if i fall into his arms all at once he may think tfoo
how horrible if he should think such were the thoughts that excited kolya_krassotkin while he was doing his utmost to assume the most independent air
what distressed him most was his being so short he did not mind so much his hideous face as being so short
on the wall in a corner at home he had the year before made a pencil mark to show his height and every two months since he anxiously measured himself against it to see how much he had gained
his face was in reality by no means hideous on the contrary it was rather attractive with a fair pale skin freckled
but alas he grew very slowly and this sometimes reduced him almost to despair his small lively gray eye had a fearless look and often glowed with feeling
he had rather high cheekbones small very red but not very thick lips his nose was small and unmistakably turned up
i ve a regular pug nose a regular pug nose kolya_krassotkin used to mutter to himself when he looked in the looking glass and he always left it with indignation
but perhaps i havent got a clever face he sometimes thought doubtful even of that but it must not be supposed that his mind was preoccupied with his face and his height
on the contrary however bitter the moments before the looking glass were to him he quickly forgot them and forgot them for a long time abandoning himself entirely to ideas and to real life as he formulated it to himself
alyosha_karamazov came out quickly and hastened up to kolya_krassotkin before he reached him kolya_krassotkin could see that he looked delighted
can he be so glad to see me kolya_krassotkin wondered feeling pleased we may note here in passing that alyosha_karamazov appearance had undergone a complete change since we saw him last
he had abandoned his cassock and was wearing now a well cut coat a soft round hat and his hair had been cropped short
all this was very becoming to him and he looked quite handsome his charming face always had a good humored expression but there was a gentleness and serenity in his good humor
to kolya_krassotkin surprise alyosha_karamazov came out to him just as he was without an overcoat he had evidently come in haste
he held out his hand to kolya_krassotkin at once here you are at last how anxious we ve been to see you
there were reason which you shall know directly anyway i am glad to make your acquaintance i ve long been hoping for an opportunity and have heard a great deal about you kolya_krassotkin muttered a little breathless
we should have met anyway i ve heard a great deal about you too but you ve been a long time coming here
tell me how are things going ilusha is very ill he is certainly dying how awful you must admit that medicine is a fraud alyosha_karamazov cried kolya_krassotkin warmly
one can see that you used to be very very dear to him before the incident with the knife
ilusha has mentioned you often very often even in his sleep in delirium you know then there another reason tell me is that your dog
yes perezvon not zhutchka alyosha_karamazov looked at kolya_krassotkin with eye full of pity is she lost for ever i know you would all like it to be zhutchka
that what i came for that what i asked you to come out here for to explain the whole episode to you before we go in he began with animation
i ve heard all about it kolya_krassotkin smiled mysteriously listen alyosha_karamazov i ll tell you all about it you see alyosha_karamazov ilusha came into the preparatory class last spring
well you know what our preparatory class is a lot of small boys they began teasing ilusha at once i am two classes higher up and of course i only look on at them from a distance
i saw the boy was weak and small but he wouldnt give in to them he fought with them i saw he was proud and his eye were full of fire
the worst of it was he was horribly dressed at the time his breeches were too small for him and there were holes in his boots
i like child like that and they teased him all the more they worried him about it they jeered at him
that i cant stand i stood up for him at once and gave it to them hot i beat them but they adore me do you know alyosha_karamazov
kolya_krassotkin boasted impulsively but i am always fond of child i ve two chickens in my hands at home now that what detained me to day
i tell you that the boy was proud but in the end he became slavishly devoted to me he did my slightest bidding obeyed me as though i were god tried to copy me
so they left off beating ilusha and i took him under my protection i saw the boy was proud in the interval between the classes he used to run to me at once and i go about with him
on sundays too they always laugh when an older boy makes friends with a younger one like that but that a prejudice
if it my fancy that enough i am teaching him developing him why shouldnt i develop him if i like him
i see you want to influence the younger generation to develop them to be of use to them and i assure you this trait in your character which i knew by hearsay attracted me more than anything
i noticed that there was a sort of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy and you know i have a positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality and i have had it from a baby
here you alyosha_karamazov have taken up with all these nestlings let us get to the point though there were contradictions in him too
he was proud but he was slavishly devoted to me and yet all at once his eye would flash and he refuse to agree with me
i used sometimes to propound certain ideas i could see that it was not so much that he disagreed with the ideas but that he was simply rebelling against me because i was cool in responding to his endearments
he argue fly into a rage and so in order to train him properly the tenderer he was the colder i became
my object was to form his character to lick him into shape to make a man of him and besides no doubt you understand me at a word
suddenly i noticed for three day in succession he was downcast and dejected not because of my coldness but for something else something more important
i have pumped him and found out that he had somehow got to know smerdyakov who was footman to your late father_zossima it was before his death of course and he taught the little fool a silly trick that is a brutal nasty trick
he told him to take a piece of bread to stick a pin in it and throw it to one of those hungry dogs who snap up anything without biting it and then to watch and see what would happen
so they prepared a piece of bread like that and threw it to zhutchka that shaggy dog there been such a fuss about
i did it on purpose that was my idea i wondered what the tragedy was the people of the house it belonged to never fed it at all though it barked all day
so it rushed at the bread swallowed it and began to squeal it turned round and round and ran away squealing as it ran out of sight
do you like that stupid barking alyosha_karamazov i cant stand it that was ilusha own account of it he confessed it to me and cried bitterly
he hugged me shaking all over he kept on repeating he ran away squealing the sight of that haunted him
he was tormented by remorse i could see that i took it seriously i determined to give him a lesson for other things as well
so i must confess i wasnt quite straightforward and pretended to be more indignant perhaps than i was you ve done a nasty thing i said you are a scoundrel
i wont tell of it of course but i shall have nothing more to do with you for a time i ll think it over and let you know through
smurov that the boy who just come with me he always ready to do anything for me whether i will have anything to do with you in the future or whether i give you up for good as a scoundrel
he was tremendously upset i must own i felt i gone too far as i spoke but there was no help for it
i did what i thought best at the time a day or two after i sent smurov to tell him that i would not speak to him again
secretly i only meant to send him to coventry for a few day and then if i saw signs of repentance to hold out my hand to him again
that what we call it when two schoolfellows refuse to have anything more to do with one another that was my intention
but what do you think happened he heard smurov message his eye flashed tell kolya_krassotkin from me he cried that i will throw bread with pins to all the dogs all all of them
so he going in for a little temper we must smoke it out of him and i began to treat him with contempt whenever i met him i turned away or smiled sarcastically
and just then that affair with his father_zossima happened you remember you must realize that he was fearfully worked up by what had happened already
the boys seeing i given him up set on him and taunted him shouting wisp of tow wisp of tow and he had soon regular skirmishes with them which i am very sorry for
they seem to have given him one very bad beating one day he flew at them all as they were coming out of school
and i swear i dont remember that i laughed it was quite the other way i felt awfully sorry for him in another minute i would have run up to take his part
i dont know what he fancied but he pulled out a penknife rushed at me and struck at my thigh here in my right leg
i stood a few yards off looking on but he suddenly met my eye i didnt move i dont mind owning i am plucky sometimes alyosha_karamazov
i simply looked at him contemptuously as though to say this is how you repay all my kindness do it again if you like i at your service
but he didnt stab me again he broke down he was frightened at what he had done he threw away the knife burst out crying and ran away
i did not sneak on him of course and i made them all keep quiet so it shouldnt come to the ears of the master
and then i heard that the same day he been throwing stones and had bitten your finger but you understand now what a state he was in
well it cant be helped it was stupid of me not to come and forgive him that is to make it up with him when he was taken ill
i didnt even tell my mother till it had healed up and the wound was a mere scratch i am sorry for it now
but i had a special reason so now i ve told you all about it but i afraid it was stupid of me
oh what a pity exclaimed alyosha_karamazov with feeling that i didnt know before what terms you were on with him or i have come to you long ago to beg you to go to him with me
would you believe it when he was feverish he talked about you in delirium i didnt know how much you were to him
and you ve really not succeeded in finding that dog his father_zossima and the boys have been hunting all over the town for it
would you believe it since he been ill i ve three time heard him repeat with tears it because i killed zhutchka father_zossima that i am ill now
god is punishing me for it he cant get that idea out of his head and if the dog were found and proved to be alive one might almost fancy the joy would cure him
we have all rested our hopes on you tell me what made you hope that i should be the one to find him
there was a report that you were looking for the dog and that you would bring it when you found it
kolya_krassotkin asked with great curiosity why did you reckon on me rather than any one else smurov said something of the sort
the boys brought him a live hare he just looked at it with a faint smile and asked them to set it free in the fields
his father_zossima has just this moment come back bringing him a mastiff pup hoping to comfort him with that but i think it only makes it worse
we ve all been trying to persuade ilusha that the dog is alive that it been seen and so we did tell me alyosha_karamazov what sort of man is the father_zossima
i know him but what do you make of him a mountebank a buffoon oh no there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow crushed
buffoonery in them is a form of resentful irony against those to whom they darent speak the truth from having been for years humiliated and intimidated by them
his whole life now is centered in ilusha and if ilusha dies he will either go mad with grief or kill himself
believe me kolya_krassotkin that sort of buffoonery is sometimes tragic in the extreme i feel almost certain of that when i look at him now
i understand you alyosha_karamazov i see you understand human nature kolya_krassotkin added with feeling and as soon as i saw you with a dog i thought it was zhutchka you were bringing
wait a bit alyosha_karamazov perhaps we shall find it yet but this is perezvon i ll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse ilusha more than the mastiff pup
wait a bit alyosha_karamazov you will know something in a minute but i say i am keeping you here kolya_krassotkin cried suddenly
you ve no overcoat on in this bitter cold you see what an egoist i am oh we are all egoists alyosha_karamazov
dont trouble it is cold but i dont often catch cold let us go in though and by the way what is your name
i know you are called kolya_krassotkin but what else nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov nikolay ivanovitch kolya_krassotkin or as they say in official documents kolya_krassotkin son
kolya_krassotkin laughed for some reason but added suddenly of course i hate my name nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov why so it so trivial so ordinary
i ll confess one weakness of mine alyosha_karamazov just to you since it our first meeting so that you may understand my character at once
i hate being asked my age more than that and in fact there a libelous story going about me that last week i played robbers with the preparatory boys
it a fact that i did play with them but it a perfect libel to say i did it for my own amusement
i have reason for believing that you ve heard the story but i wasnt playing for my own amusement it was for the sake of the child because they couldnt think of anything to do by themselves
you are thirteen asked alyosha_karamazov no fourteen that is i shall be fourteen very soon in a fortnight but they ve always got some silly tale
this is an awful town for gossip i can tell you but what if you had been playing for your own amusement what the harm
come i say for my own amusement you dont play horses do you but you must look at it like this said alyosha_karamazov smiling
grown up people go to the theater and there the adventures of all sort of heroes are represented sometimes there are robbers and battles too and isnt that just the same thing in a different form of course
and young people games of soldiers or robbers in their playtime are also art in its first stage you know they spring from the growing artistic instincts of the young
and sometimes these games are much better than performances in the theater the only difference is that people go there to look at the actors while in these games the young people are the actors themselves
but that only natural you think so is that your idea kolya_krassotkin looked at him intently oh you know that rather an interesting view
when i go home i ll think it over i ll admit i thought i might learn something from you i ve come to learn of you alyosha_karamazov kolya_krassotkin concluded in a voice full of spontaneous feeling
what struck him most was that he treated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him just as if he were quite grown up
and i of you said alyosha_karamazov smiling and pressing his hand kolya_krassotkin was much pleased with alyosha_karamazov i ll show you something directly alyosha_karamazov it a theatrical performance too he said laughing nervously
that why i ve come let us go first to the people of the house on the left all the boys leave their coats in there because the room is small and hot
oh i only coming in for a minute i ll keep on my overcoat perezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead
i ll go in first and explore then i ll whistle to him when i think fit and you ll see he ll dash in like mad
ici perezvon lie down and be dead you see how he dead only smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment
i ll arrange it all and you ll see something chapter by ilusha bedside the room inhabited by the family of the retired captain
several boys were sitting with ilusha and though all of them like smurov were prepared to deny that it was alyosha_karamazov who had brought them and reconciled them with ilusha it was really the fact
all the art he had used had been to take them one by one to ilusha without sheepish sentimentality appearing to do so casually and without design
snegiryov is already familiar to the reader it was close and crowded at that moment with a number of visitors it was a great consolation to ilusha in his suffering
he was greatly touched by seeing the almost tender affection and sympathy shown him by these boys who had been his enemies
kolya_krassotkin was the only one missing and his absence was a heavy load on ilusha heart perhaps the bitterest of all his bitter memories was his stabbing kolya_krassotkin who had been his one friend and protector
but when smurov hinted to kolya_krassotkin that alyosha_karamazov wanted to come and see him about something the latter cut him short bidding smurov
at once that he knew best what to do that he wanted no one advice and that if he went to see ilusha he would choose his own time for he had his own reason
clever little smurov who was the first to make it up with ilusha thought it was so tell alyosha_karamazov that was a fortnight before this sunday
that was why alyosha_karamazov had not been to see him as he had meant to but though he waited he sent smurov to him twice again
both time kolya_krassotkin met him with a curt impatient refusal sending alyosha_karamazov a message not to bother him any more that if he came himself he kolya_krassotkin would not go to ilusha at all
up to the very last day smurov did not know that kolya_krassotkin meant to go to ilusha that morning and only the evening before as he parted from smurov kolya_krassotkin abruptly told him to wait at home for him next morning for he would go with him to the snegiryovs but warned him on no account to say he was coming as he wanted to drop in casually
smurov fancy that kolya_krassotkin would bring back the lost dog was based on the words kolya_krassotkin had dropped that they must be asses not to find the dog if it was alive
smurov obeyed when smurov waiting for an opportunity timidly hinted at his guess about the dog kolya_krassotkin flew into a violent rage
i not such an ass as to go hunting about the town for other people dogs when i ve got a dog of my own
and how can you imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing a pin sheepish sentimentality that what it is
for the last fortnight ilusha had not left his little bed under the ikons in the corner he had not been to school since the day he met alyosha_karamazov and bit his finger
he was taken ill the same day though for a month afterwards he was sometimes able to get up and walk about the room and passage
but latterly he had become so weak that he could not move without help from his father_zossima his father_zossima was terribly concerned about him
and often especially after leading him round the room on his arm and putting him back to bed he would run to a dark corner in the passage and leaning his head against the wall he would break into paroxysms of violent weeping stifling his sobs that they might not be heard by ilusha
returning to the room he would usually begin doing something to amuse and comfort his precious boy he would tell him stories funny anecdotes or would mimic comic people he had happened to meet even imitate the howls and cries of animals
he even gave up drinking and was almost crazy with terror that his boy would die but ilusha could not bear to see his father_zossima fooling and playing the buffoon
though the boy tried not to show how he disliked it he saw with an aching heart that his father_zossima was an object of contempt and he was continually haunted by the memory of the wisp of tow and that terrible day
nina ilusha gentle crippled sister did not like her father_zossima buffoonery either varvara had been gone for some time past to petersburg to study at the university
it was the only way she could be amused all the rest of the time she was grumbling and complaining that now every one had forgotten her that no one treated her with respect that she was slighted and so on
but the half imbecile mother was greatly diverted and laughed heartily when her husband began capering about or performing something but during the last few day she had completely changed
she began looking constantly at ilusha bed in the corner and seemed lost in thought she was more silent quieter and if she cried she cried quietly so as not to be heard
the boys visits at first only angered her but later on their merry shouts and stories began to divert her and at last she liked them so much that if the boys had given up coming she would have felt dreary without them
the captain noticed the change in her with mournful perplexity when the child told some story or played a game she laughed and clapped her hands
as for the captain the presence in his room of the child who came to cheer up ilusha filled his heart from the first with ecstatic joy
she called some of them to her and kissed them she was particularly fond of smurov he even hoped that ilusha would now get over his depression and that that would hasten his recovery
in spite of his alarm about ilusha he had not till lately felt one minute doubt of his boy ultimate recovery
he met his little visitors with homage waited upon them hand and foot he was ready to be their horse and even began letting them ride on his back but ilusha did not like the game and it was given up
he began buying little things for them gingerbread and nuts gave them tea and cut them sandwiches it must be noted that all this time he had plenty of money
and afterwards katerina_ivanovna learning more about their circumstances and ilusha illness visited them herself made the acquaintance of the family and succeeded in fascinating the half imbecile mother
since then she had been lavish in helping them and the captain terror stricken at the thought that his boy might be dying forgot his pride and humbly accepted her assistance
all this time doctor herzenstube who was called in by katerina_ivanovna came punctually every other day but little was gained by his visits and he dosed the invalid mercilessly
but on that sunday morning a new doctor was expected who had come from moscow where he had a great reputation
katerina_ivanovna had sent for him from moscow at great expense not expressly for ilusha but for another object of which more will be said in its place hereafter
but as he had come she had asked him to see ilusha as well and the captain had been told to expect him
he hadnt the slightest idea that kolya_krassotkin was coming though he had long wished for a visit from the boy for whom ilusha was fretting
at the moment when kolya_krassotkin opened the door and came into the room the captain and all the boys were round ilusha bed looking at a tiny mastiff pup which had only been born the day before though the captain had bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse ilusha who was still fretting over the lost and probably dead zhutchka
ilusha who had heard three day before that he was to be presented with a puppy not an ordinary puppy but a pedigree mastiff a very important point of course tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he was pleased
but his father_zossima and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy only served to recall to his little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he had killed
he had taken the two hundred roubles from katerina_ivanovna just as alyosha_karamazov had predicted he would the puppy lay beside him feebly moving and he smiling sadly stroked it with his thin pale wasted hand
clearly he liked the puppy but it wasnt zhutchka if he could have had zhutchka and the puppy too then he would have been completely happy
kolya_krassotkin entrance made a general sensation the boys moved away and stood on each side of the bed so that he could get a full view of ilusha
kolya_krassotkin cried one of the boys suddenly he was the first to see him come in the captain ran eagerly to meet kolya_krassotkin
please come in you are welcome he said hurriedly ilusha mr kolya_krassotkin has come to see you
he turned first to the captain wife sitting in her arm chair who was very ill humored at the moment and was grumbling that the boys stood between her and ilusha bed and did not let her see the new puppy
with the greatest courtesy he made her a bow scraping his foot and turning to nina he made her as the only other lady present a similar bow
but kolya_krassotkin shaking hands with him hurriedly instantly showed his complete knowledge of the manners of good society this polite behavior made an extremely favorable impression on the deranged lady
there you can see at once he is a young man that has been well brought up she commented aloud throwing up her hands but as for our other visitors they come in one on the top of another
how do you mean mamma one on the top of another how is that muttered the captain affectionately though a little anxious on her account
that how they ride in they get on each other shoulders in the passage and prance in like that on a respectable family
strange sort of visitors but who come in like that mamma why that boy came in riding on that one back and this one on that one
kolya_krassotkin was already by ilusha bedside the sick boy turned visibly paler he raised himself in the bed and looked intently at kolya_krassotkin
he had never imagined that he would see such a wasted yellow face such enormous feverishly glowing eye and such thin little hands
kolya_krassotkin had not seen his little friend for two months and he was overwhelmed at the sight of him he saw with grieved surprise ilusha rapid hard breathing and dry lips
he stepped close to him held out his hand and almost overwhelmed he said well old man how are you
but his voice failed him he couldnt achieve an appearance of ease his face suddenly twitched and the corners of his mouth quivered
ilusha smiled a pitiful little smile still unable to utter a word something moved kolya_krassotkin to raise his hand and pass it over ilusha hair
never mind he murmured softly to him to cheer him up or perhaps not knowing why he said it
for a minute they were silent again hallo so you ve got a new puppy kolya_krassotkin said suddenly in a most callous voice
a black nose that means he ll be fierce a good house dog kolya_krassotkin observed gravely and stolidly as if the only thing he cared about was the puppy and its black nose
but in reality he still had to do his utmost to control his feeling not to burst out crying like a child and do what he would he could not control it
ye es answered ilusha in a long whisper gasping for breath when it grows up you ll have to keep it on the chain i sure
he ll be a huge dog cried one of the boys of course he will a mastiff large like this as big as a calf shouted several voices
i got one like that on purpose one of the fiercest breed and his parents are huge and very fierce they stand as high as this from the floor
as big as a calf as a real calf chimed in the captain sit down here on ilusha bed or here on the bench
you are welcome we ve been hoping to see you a long time you were so kind as to come with alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
though he had perhaps prepared a free and easy opening for the conversation on his way now he completely lost the thread of it
kolya_krassotkin sat on the edge of the bed at ilusha feet no i came with perezvon i ve got a dog now called perezvon
a slavonic name he out there if i whistle he ll run in i ve brought a dog too he said addressing ilusha all at once
do you remember zhutchka old man he suddenly fired the question at him ilusha little face quivered he looked with an agonized expression at kolya_krassotkin
alyosha_karamazov standing at the door frowned and signed to kolya_krassotkin not to speak of zhutchka but he did not or would not notice
where is zhutchka ilusha asked in a broken voice oh well my boy your zhutchka lost and done for
ilusha did not speak but he fixed an intent gaze once more on kolya_krassotkin alyosha_karamazov catching kolya_krassotkin eye signed to him vigorously again but he turned away his eye pretending not to have noticed
it must have run away and died somewhere it must have died after a meal like that kolya_krassotkin pronounced pitilessly though he seemed a little breathless
but i ve got a dog perezvon a slavonic name i ve brought him to show you i dont want him said ilusha suddenly
no no you really must see him it will amuse you i brought him on purpose he the same sort of shaggy dog
you allow me to call in my dog madam he suddenly addressed madame snegiryov with inexplicable excitement in his manner
i dont want him i dont want him cried ilusha with a mournful break in his voice there was a reproachful light in his eye
you better the captain started up from the chest by the wall on which he had just sat down you better another time he muttered but kolya_krassotkin could not be restrained
he hurriedly shouted to smurov open the door and as soon as it was open he blew his whistle perezvon dashed headlong into the room
jump perezvon beg beg shouted kolya_krassotkin jumping up and the dog stood erect on its hind legs by ilusha bedside
what followed was a surprise to every one ilusha started lurched violently forward bent over perezvon and gazed at him faint with suspense
it zhutchka he cried suddenly in a voice breaking with joy and suffering and who did you think it was
kolya_krassotkin shouted with all his might in a ringing happy voice and bending down he seized the dog and lifted him up to ilusha
look old man you see blind of one eye and the left ear is torn just the marks you described to me
it was by that i found him i found him directly he did not belong to any one he explained turning quickly to the captain to his wife to alyosha_karamazov and then again to ilusha
he used to live in the fedotovs back yard though he made his home there they did not feed him he was a stray dog that had run away from the village
i found him you see old man he couldnt have swallowed what you gave him if he had he must have died he must have
so he must have spat it out since he is alive you did not see him do it but the pin pricked his tongue that is why he squealed
he ran away squealing and you thought he swallowed it he might well squeal because the skin of dogs mouths is so tender tenderer than in man much tenderer
kolya_krassotkin cried impetuously his face glowing and radiant with delight ilusha could not speak white as a sheet he gazed open mouthed at kolya_krassotkin with his great eye almost starting out of his head
and if kolya_krassotkin who had no suspicion of it had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such a moment might have on the sick child health nothing would have induced him to play such a trick on him
but alyosha_karamazov was perhaps the only person in the room who realized it as for the captain he behaved like a small child
zhutchka it zhutchka he cried in a blissful voice ilusha this is zhutchka your zhutchka mamma this is zhutchka
he was almost weeping and i never guessed cried smurov regretfully bravo kolya_krassotkin i said he find the dog and here he found him
here he found him another boy repeated gleefully kolya_krassotkin a brick cried a third voice he a brick he a brick
cried the other boys and they began clapping wait wait kolya_krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all
i ll tell you how it happened that the whole point i found him i took him home and hid him at once
i kept him locked up at home and did not show him to any one till to day only smurov has known for the last fortnight but i assured him this dog was called perezvon
and he did not guess and meanwhile i taught the dog all sort of tricks you should only see all the things he can do
i trained him so as to bring you a well trained dog in good condition old man so as to be able to say to you see old man what a fine dog your zhutchka is now
havent you a bit of meat he ll show you a trick that will make you die with laughing a piece of meat havent you got any
the captain ran across the passage to the landlady where their cooking was done not to lose precious time kolya_krassotkin in desperate haste shouted to perezvon dead
and the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back with its four paws in the air the boys laughed
ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile but the person most delighted with the dog performance was mamma she laughed at the dog and began snapping her fingers and calling it perezvon perezvon
he wont move for all the shouting in the world but if i call to him he ll jump up in a minute
nothing will make him get up nothing kolya_krassotkin cried triumphantly proud of his success ici perezvon the dog leapt up and bounded about whining with delight
the captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef is it hot kolya_krassotkin inquired hurriedly with a business like air taking the meat
dogs dont like hot things no it all right look everybody look ilusha look old man why arent you looking
the new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose
the luckless dog had to stand without moving with the meat on his nose as long as his master chose to keep him without a movement perhaps for half an hour
he does not look at him now i ve brought him but he kept perezvon only for a brief moment
paid for cried kolya_krassotkin and the meat passed in a flash from the dog nose to his mouth the audience of course expressed enthusiasm and surprise
can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the dog exclaimed alyosha_karamazov with an involuntary note of reproach in his voice
simply for that answered kolya_krassotkin with perfect simplicity i wanted to show him in all his glory perezvon
perezvon called ilusha suddenly snapping his thin fingers and beckoning to the dog what is it let him jump up on the bed
ici perezvon kolya_krassotkin slapped the bed and perezvon darted up by ilusha the boy threw both arms round his head and perezvon instantly licked his cheek
ilusha crept close to him stretched himself out in bed and hid his face in the dog shaggy coat dear dear kept exclaiming the captain
kolya_krassotkin sat down again on the edge of the bed ilusha i can show you another trick i ve brought you a little cannon
you remember i told you about it before and you said how much you like to see it well here i ve brought it to you
another time he would have waited till the sensation made by perezvon had passed off now he hurried on regardless of all consideration
and kolya_krassotkin hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon he hurried because he was happy himself
you are all happy now he felt so here something to make you happier he was perfectly enchanted himself
i ve been coveting this thing for a long while it for you old man it for you it belonged to morozov it was no use to him he had it from his brother
i swopped a book from father_zossima book case for it a kinsman of mahomet or salutary folly a scandalous book published in moscow a hundred years ago before they had any censorship
and morozov has a taste for such things he was grateful to me too kolya_krassotkin held the cannon in his hand so that all could see and admire it
the sensation was even greater when kolya_krassotkin announced that he had gunpowder too and that it could be fired off at once if it wont alarm the lady
ilusha raised himself and with his right arm still round the dog he gazed enchanted at the toy mamma immediately asked to look at the toy closer and her request was granted
she was much pleased with the little bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her lap
she readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired without any idea of what she had been asked kolya_krassotkin showed the powder and the shot
the captain as a military man undertook to load it putting in a minute quantity of powder he asked that the shot might be put off till another time
the cannon was put on the floor aiming towards an empty part of the room three grains of powder were thrust into the touch hole and a match was put to it
a magnificent explosion followed mamma was startled but at once laughed with delight the boys gazed in speechless triumph but the captain looking at ilusha was more enchanted than any of them
kolya_krassotkin picked up the cannon and immediately presented it to ilusha together with the powder and the shot i got it for you for you
i ve been keeping it for you a long time he repeated once more in his delight oh give it to me
no give me the cannon mamma began begging like a little child her face showed a piteous fear that she would not get it
mamma mamma he ran to her the cannon yours of course but let ilusha have it because it a present to him but it just as good as yours
kolya_krassotkin was disconcerted the captain fidgeted uneasily ilusha will always let you play with it it shall belong to both of you both of you
no i dont want it to belong to both of us i want it to be mine altogether not ilusha persisted mamma on the point of tears
he turned to kolya_krassotkin with an imploring face as though he were afraid he might be offended at his giving his present to some one else
of course you may kolya_krassotkin assented heartily and taking the cannon from ilusha he handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow
take it mother here keep it ilusha cried kolya_krassotkin may i give it to my mother she was so touched that she cried
ilusha darling he the one who loves his mamma she said tenderly and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her lap again
mamma let me kiss your hand the captain darted up to her at once and did so and i never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy said the grateful lady pointing to kolya_krassotkin
and i ll bring you as much powder as you like ilusha we make the powder ourselves now borovikov found out how it made twenty four parts of saltpeter ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal
it all pounded together mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through a tammy sieve that how it done smurov told me about your powder only father_zossima says it not real gunpowder responded ilusha
not real kolya_krassotkin flushed it burns i dont know of course no i didnt mean that put in the captain with a guilty face
i only said that real powder is not made like that but that nothing it can be made so
i dont know you know best we lighted some in a pomatum pot it burned splendidly it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash
but that was only the paste and if you rub it through but of course you know best i dont know
and bulkin father_zossima thrashed him on account of our powder did you hear he turned to ilusha yes answered ilusha
he listened to kolya_krassotkin with immense interest and enjoyment we had prepared a whole bottle of it and he used to keep it under his bed
his father_zossima saw it he said it might explode and thrashed him on the spot he was going to make a complaint against me to the master
he is not allowed to go about with me now no one is allowed to go about with me now smurov is not allowed to either i ve got a bad name with every one
they say i a desperate character kolya_krassotkin smiled scornfully it all began from what happened on the railway ah we ve heard of that exploit of yours too cried the captain
how could you lie still on the line is it possible you werent the least afraid lying there under the train
werent you frightened the captain was abject in his flattery of kolya_krassotkin not particularly answered kolya_krassotkin carelessly what blasted my reputation more than anything here was that cursed goose he said turning again to ilusha
but though he assumed an unconcerned air as he talked he still could not control himself and was continually missing the note he tried to keep up
ah i heard about the goose ilusha laughed beaming all over they told me but i didnt understand did they really take you to the court
the most stupid trivial affair they made a mountain of a molehill as they always do kolya_krassotkin began carelessly i was walking through the market place here one day just when they driven in the geese
all at once a fellow who is an errand boy at plotnikov now looked at me and said what are you looking at the geese for
i stopped and looked at them i looked at him he was a stupid moon faced fellow of twenty i am always on the side of the peasantry you know
i like talking to the peasants we ve dropped behind the peasants that an axiom i believe you are laughing alyosha_karamazov no heaven forbid i am listening said alyosha_karamazov with a most good natured air and the sensitive kolya_krassotkin was immediately reassured
i believe in the people and am always glad to give them their due but i am not for spoiling them that is a sine qua non
my theory alyosha_karamazov is clear and simple he hurried on again looking pleased but i was telling you about the goose
so i turned to the fool and answered i am wondering what the goose thinks about he looked at me quite stupidly and what does the goose think about
the oats are dropping out of the sack and the goose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them up do you see
he asked do you see that cart full of oats i said i see that quite well he said
well said i if that cart were to move on a little would it break the goose neck or not
it be sure to break it and he grinned all over his face highly delighted come on then said i let try
and it did not take us long to arrange he stood at the bridle without being noticed and i stood on one side to direct the goose
and the owner wasnt looking he was talking to some one so i had nothing to do the goose thrust its head in after the oats of itself under the cart just under the wheel
let he said i winked at the lad he tugged at the bridle and crack the goose neck was broken in half
and as luck would have it all the peasants saw us at that moment and they kicked up a shindy at once
you did that on purpose no not on purpose yes you did on purpose well they shouted take him to the justice of the peace
they took me too you were there too they said you helped you re known all over the market and for some reason i really am known all over the market kolya_krassotkin added conceitedly
we all went off to the justice they brought the goose too the fellow was crying in a great funk simply blubbering like a woman
and the farmer kept shouting that you could kill any number of geese like that well of course there were witnesses
the justice of the peace settled it in a minute that the farmer was to be paid a rouble for the goose and the fellow to have the goose
and he was warned not to play such pranks again and the fellow kept blubbering like a woman it wasnt me he said it was he egged me on and he pointed to me
i answered with the utmost composure that i hadnt egged him on that i simply stated the general proposition had spoken hypothetically
i ll complain to your master of you so that for the future you maynt waste your time on such general propositions instead of sitting at your book and learning your lessons
he didnt complain to the master that was a joke but the matter was noised abroad and came to the ears of the master
the justice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself at once for having smiled their ears are long you know
the classical master kolbasnikov was particularly shocked about it but dardanelov got me off again but kolbasnikov is savage with every one now like a green ass
did you know ilusha he is just married got a dowry of a thousand roubles and his bride a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree
the third class fellows wrote an epigram on it astounding news has reached the class kolbasnikov has been an ass and so on awfully funny i ll bring it to you later on
i say nothing against dardanelov he is a learned man there no doubt about it i respect man like that and it not because he stood up for me
but you took him down about the founders of troy smurov put in suddenly unmistakably proud of kolya_krassotkin at such a moment
he was particularly pleased with the story of the goose did you really take him down the captain inquired in a flattering way
on the question who founded troy we heard of it ilusha told me about it at the time he knows everything father_zossima he knows more than any of us
put in ilusha he only pretends to be like that but really he is top in every subject ilusha looked at kolya_krassotkin with infinite happiness
oh that all nonsense about troy a trivial matter i consider this an unimportant question said kolya_krassotkin with haughty humility
he felt that he was greatly excited and that he had talked about the goose for instance with too little reserve while alyosha_karamazov had looked serious and had not said a word all the time
and the vain boy began by degrees to have a rankling fear that alyosha_karamazov was silent because he despised him and thought he was showing off before him
he had by now completely recovered his dignity though he was still a little uneasy if he dared to think anything like that kolya_krassotkin would
and i know who founded troy a boy who had not spoken before said suddenly to the surprise of every one
i regard the question as quite a trivial one he rapped out again proudly he was silent and seemed to be shy
he was a pretty boy of about eleven called kartashov he was sitting near the door kolya_krassotkin looked at him with dignified amazement
the fact was that the identity of the founders of troy had become a secret for the whole school a secret which could only be discovered by reading smaragdov and no one had smaragdov but kolya_krassotkin
one day when kolya_krassotkin back was turned kartashov hastily opened smaragdov which lay among kolya_krassotkin book and immediately lighted on the passage relating to the foundation of troy
this was a good time ago but he felt uneasy and could not bring himself to announce publicly that he too knew who had founded troy afraid of what might happen and of kolya_krassotkin somehow putting him to shame over it
but now he couldnt resist saying it for weeks he had been longing to well who did found it asked kolya_krassotkin turning to him with haughty superciliousness
he saw from his face that he really did know and at once made up his mind how to take it
troy was founded by teucer dardanus ilius and tros the boy rapped out at once and in the same instant he blushed blushed so that it was painful to look at him
but the boys stared at him stared at him for a whole minute and then all the staring eye turned at once and were fastened upon kolya_krassotkin who was still scanning the audacious boy with disdainful composure
there was so to speak a discordant note in the general harmony in what sense did they found it
he deigned to comment at last and what is meant by founding a city or a state what do they do
did they go and each lay a brick do you suppose there was laughter the offending boy turned from pink to crimson
before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a nationality you must first understand what you mean by it he admonished him in stern incisive tones
he was silent and on the point of tears kolya_krassotkin held him so for a minute but i attach no consequence to these old wives tales
and i dont think much of universal history in general he added carelessly addressing the company generally universal history
the captain inquired looking almost scared yes universal history it the study of the successive follies of mankind and nothing more
he was showing off and he stole a glance at alyosha_karamazov his was the only opinion he was afraid of there
the only subjects i respect are mathematics and natural science said kolya_krassotkin but alyosha_karamazov was still silent and still serious as before
if alyosha_karamazov had said a word it would have stopped him but alyosha_karamazov was silent and it might be the silence of contempt and that finally irritated kolya_krassotkin
the classical languages too they are simply madness nothing more you seem to disagree with me again alyosha_karamazov i dont agree said alyosha_karamazov with a faint smile
the study of the classics if you ask my opinion is simply a police measure that simply why it has been introduced into our schools
by degrees kolya_krassotkin began to get breathless again latin and greek were introduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect
it was dull before so what could they do to make things duller it was senseless enough before so what could they do to make it more senseless
so they thought of greek and latin that my opinion i hope i shall never change it kolya_krassotkin finished abruptly
his cheeks were flushed that true assented smurov suddenly in a ringing tone of conviction he had listened attentively
and yet he is first in latin himself cried one of the group of boys suddenly yes father_zossima he says that
and yet he is first in latin echoed ilusha what of it kolya_krassotkin thought fit to defend himself though the praise was very sweet to him
i am fagging away at latin because i have to because i promised my mother to pass my examination and i think that whatever you do it worth doing it well
but in my soul i have a profound contempt for the classics and all that fraud you dont agree alyosha_karamazov
well all the classical author have been translated into all languages so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced latin but solely as a police measure to stupefy the intelligence
why fraud alyosha_karamazov smiled again so what can one call it but a fraud why who taught you all this
cried alyosha_karamazov surprised at last in the first place i am capable of thinking for myself without being taught
besides what i said just now about the classics being translated our teacher kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class
the doctor has come cried nina who had been silent till then a carriage belonging to madame_hohlakov drove up to the gate
the captain who had been expecting the doctor all the morning rushed headlong out to meet him mamma pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air
alyosha_karamazov went up to ilusha and began setting his pillows straight nina from her invalid chair anxiously watched him putting the bed tidy
the boys hurriedly took leave some of them promised to come again in the evening kolya_krassotkin called perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed
i wont go away i wont go away kolya_krassotkin said hastily to ilusha i ll wait in the passage and come back when the doctor gone i ll come back with perezvon
but by now the doctor had entered an important looking person with long dark whiskers and a shiny shaven chin wearing a bearskin coat
as he crossed the threshold he stopped taken aback he probably fancied he had come to the wrong place
how is this where am i he muttered not removing his coat nor his peaked sealskin cap the crowd the poverty of the room the washing hanging on a line in the corner puzzled him
the captain bent double was bowing low before him it here sir here sir he muttered cringingly it here you ve come right you were coming to us
the doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threw off his coat displaying to all eye the grand decoration at his neck
sne gi ryov the doctor said loudly and pompously mr snegiryov is that you that me sir ah the captain caught the fur coat in the air and the doctor took off his cap
where is the patient he asked emphatically chapter vi precocity what do you think the doctor will say to him
kolya_krassotkin asked quickly what a repulsive mug though hasnt he i cant endure medicine ilusha is dying i think that certain answered alyosha_karamazov mournfully
they are rogues medicine a fraud i am glad to have made your acquaintance though alyosha_karamazov i wanted to know you for a long time
i am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances kolya_krassotkin had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more demonstrative but he felt ill at ease
alyosha_karamazov noticed this smiled and pressed his hand i ve long learned to respect you as a rare person kolya_krassotkin muttered again faltering and uncertain
i have heard you are a mystic and have been in the monastery i know you are a mystic but that hasnt put me off
contact with real life will cure you it always so with characters like yours what do you mean by mystic
cure me of what alyosha_karamazov was rather astonished oh god and all the rest of it what dont you believe in god
i admit that he is needed for the order of the universe and all that and that if there were no god he would have to be invented added kolya_krassotkin beginning to blush
he suddenly fancied that alyosha_karamazov might think he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was grown up
oh i ve nothing against god of course god is only a hypothesis but i havent the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to him kolya_krassotkin thought indignantly
and all of a sudden he felt horribly annoyed i must confess i cant endure entering on such discussions he said with a final air
it possible for one who doesnt believe in god to love mankind dont you think so voltaire didnt believe in god and loved mankind
voltaire believed in god though not very much i think and i dont think he loved mankind very much either said alyosha_karamazov quietly gently and quite naturally as though he were talking to some one of his own age or even older
i am at it again he thought to himself kolya_krassotkin was particularly struck by alyosha_karamazov apparent diffidence about his opinion of voltaire
he seemed to be leaving the question for him little kolya_krassotkin to settle have you read voltaire alyosha_karamazov finished
no not to say read but i ve read candide in the russian translation in an absurd grotesque old translation
at it again again and did you understand it oh yes everything that is why do you suppose i shouldnt understand it
there a lot of nastiness in it of course of course i can understand that it a philosophical novel and written to advocate an idea
kolya_krassotkin was getting mixed by now i am a socialist alyosha_karamazov i am an incurable socialist he announced suddenly apropos of nothing
a socialist laughed alyosha_karamazov but when have you had time to become one why i thought you were only thirteen
in the first place i am not thirteen but fourteen fourteen in a fortnight he flushed angrily and in the second place i am at a complete loss to understand what my age has to do with it
kolya_krassotkin winced the question is what are my convictions not what is my age isnt it when you are older you ll understand for yourself the influence of age on convictions
i fancied too that you were not expressing your own ideas alyosha_karamazov answered serenely and modestly but kolya_krassotkin interrupted him hotly come you want obedience and mysticism
you must admit that the christian religion for instance has only been of use to the rich and the powerful to keep the lower classes in slavery
that so isnt it ah i know where you read that and i am sure some one told you so cried alyosha_karamazov
i say what makes you think i read it and certainly no one told me so i can think for myself
he was a most humane person and if he were alive to day he would be found in the ranks of the revolutionists and would perhaps play a conspicuous part
i am not opposed to church_of_christ if you like there no doubt about that oh where where did you get that from
what fool have you made friends with exclaimed alyosha_karamazov come the truth will out it has so chanced that i have often talked to mr_rakitin of course but
old byelinsky said that too so they say byelinsky i dont remember he hasnt written that anywhere if he didnt write it they say he said it
i heard that from a but never mind and have you read byelinsky well no i havent read all of him
but i read the passage about tatyana why she didnt go off with onyegin didnt go off with onyegin surely you dont understand that already
why you seem to take me for little smurov said kolya_krassotkin with a grin of irritation but please dont suppose i am such a revolutionist
i often disagree with mr_rakitin though i mention tatyana i am not at all for the emancipation of women i acknowledge that women are a subject race and must obey
kolya_krassotkin for some reason smiled and on that question at least i am quite of one mind with that pseudo great man
les femmes tricottent as napoleon said i think too that to leave one own country and fly to america is mean worse than mean silly
why go to america when one may be of great service to humanity here now especially there a perfect mass of fruitful activity open to us
that what i answered what do you mean answered whom has some one suggested your going to america already
i must own they ve been at me to go but i declined that between ourselves of course alyosha_karamazov do you hear not a word to any one
i am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of the secret police and take lessons at the chain bridge
i say this only to you long will you remember the house at the chain bridge do you remember it splendid
what if he should find out that i ve only that one number of the bell in father_zossima bookcase and havent read any more of it
why are you laughing you dont suppose i am fibbing do you kolya_krassotkin thought with a shudder oh no i am not laughing and dont suppose for a moment that you are lying
no indeed i cant suppose so for all this alas is perfectly true but tell me have you read pushkin onyegin for instance
you spoke just now of tatyana no i havent read it yet but i want to read it i have no prejudices alyosha_karamazov i want to hear both sides
what makes you ask oh nothing tell me alyosha_karamazov have you an awful contempt for me kolya_krassotkin rapped out suddenly and drew himself up before alyosha_karamazov as though he were on drill
be so kind as to tell me without beating about the bush i have a contempt for you alyosha_karamazov looked at him wondering
i am only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by all this crude nonsense before you have begun life
what for dont be anxious about my nature kolya_krassotkin interrupted not without complacency but it true that i am stupidly sensitive crudely sensitive
you smiled just now and i fancied you seemed to oh my smile meant something quite different i ll tell you why i smiled
not long ago i read the criticism made by a german who had lived in russia on our students and schoolboys of to day
show a russian schoolboy he writes a map of the stars which he knows nothing about and he will give you back the map next day with corrections on it
no knowledge and unbounded conceit that what the german meant to say about the russian schoolboy yes that perfectly right kolya_krassotkin laughed suddenly exactly so
conceit may be that comes from youth that will be corrected if need be but on the other hand there is an independent spirit almost from childhood boldness of thought and conviction and not the spirit of these sausage makers groveling before authority
bravo the german but he did not see the good side what do you think but the german was right all the same
bravo the german but germans want strangling all the same though they are so good at science and learning they must be strangled
i am awfully childish sometimes and when i am pleased about anything i cant restrain myself and am ready to talk any stuff
strangled what for smiled alyosha_karamazov well perhaps i am talking nonsense i agree but i say we are chattering away here about nothing and that doctor has been a long time in there
but perhaps he examining the mamma and that poor crippled nina i liked that nina you know she whispered to me suddenly as i was coming away why didnt you come before
and in such a voice so reproachfully i think she is awfully nice and pathetic yes yes well you ll be coming often you will see what she is like
it would do you a great deal of good to know people like that to learn to value a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people alyosha_karamazov observed warmly
that would have more effect on you than anything oh how i regret and blame myself for not having come sooner
kolya_krassotkin exclaimed with bitter feeling yes it a great pity you saw for yourself how delighted the poor child was to see you
what kept me from coming was my conceit my egoistic vanity and the beastly wilfullness which i never can get rid of though i ve been struggling with it all my life
and how he fretted for you to come dont tell me you make it worse but it serves me right i see that now
no you have a charming nature though it been distorted and i quite understand why you have had such an influence on this generous morbidly sensitive boy alyosha_karamazov answered warmly
i am a beast in lots of ways alyosha_karamazov and you say that to me cried kolya_krassotkin and would you believe it
i thought i ve thought several time since i ve been here that you despised me if only you knew how i prize your opinion
would you believe it just now when you were telling your story i thought as i watched you that you must be very sensitive
but are you really so sensitive at your age you thought so what an eye you ve got i say
that was just when i was fancying you had a great contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off and for a moment i quite hated you for it and began talking like a fool
then i fancied just now here when i said that if there were no god he would have to be invented that i was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge especially as i got that phrase out of a book
i bet that was when i was talking about the goose but i swear i wasnt showing off out of vanity though i really dont know why
yes i believe it was because i was so pleased though it perfectly disgraceful for any one to be gushing
because i was so pleased directly they are pleased i know that but i am convinced now that you dont despise me it was all my imagination
i sometimes fancy all sort of things that every one is laughing at me the whole world and then i feel ready to overturn the whole order of things
oh alyosha_karamazov i am profoundly unhappy and you worry every one about you smiled alyosha_karamazov yes i worry every one about me especially my mother
alyosha_karamazov tell me am i very ridiculous now dont think about that dont think of it at all cried alyosha_karamazov
and what does ridiculous mean isnt every one constantly being or seeming ridiculous besides nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid of being ridiculous and that makes them unhappy
all i am surprised at is that you should be feeling that so early though i ve observed it for some time past and not only in you
the devil has taken the form of that vanity and entered into the whole generation it simply the devil added alyosha_karamazov without a trace of the smile that kolya_krassotkin staring at him expected to see
nowadays the very child have begun to suffer from it it almost a sort of insanity you are like every one else said alyosha_karamazov in conclusion that is like very many others
only you must not be like everybody else that all even if every one is like that yes even if every one is like that
you really are not like every one else here you are not ashamed to confess to something bad and even ridiculous
you be the only one not like it and who will admit so much in these day no one and people have even ceased to feel the impulse to self criticism
dont be like every one else even if you are the only one splendid i was not mistaken in you you know how to console one
oh how i have longed to know you alyosha_karamazov i ve long been eager for this meeting can you really have thought about me too
yes i heard of you and had thought of you too and if it partly vanity that makes you ask it doesnt matter
do you know alyosha_karamazov our talk has been like a declaration of love said kolya_krassotkin in a bashful and melting voice
you said just now that you thought of me too that not ridiculous is it not at all ridiculous and if it were it wouldnt matter because it been a good thing
alyosha_karamazov smiled brightly but do you know alyosha_karamazov you must admit that you are a little ashamed yourself now
i see it by your eye kolya_krassotkin smiled with a sort of sly happiness why ashamed well why are you blushing
it was you made me blush laughed alyosha_karamazov and he really did blush oh well i am a little goodness knows why i dont know
he muttered almost embarrassed oh how i love you and admire you at this moment just because you are rather ashamed
because you are just like me cried kolya_krassotkin in positive ecstasy his cheeks glowed his eye beamed you know kolya_krassotkin you will be very unhappy in your life something made alyosha_karamazov say suddenly
i know i know how you know it all beforehand kolya_krassotkin agreed at once but you will bless life on the whole all the same
just so hurrah you are a prophet oh we shall get on together alyosha_karamazov do you know what delights me most is that you treat me quite like an equal
do you know all this last month i ve been saying to myself either we shall be friends at once for ever or we shall part enemies to the grave
but we are not equals no we are not you are better but we shall get on and saying that of course you loved me alyosha_karamazov laughed gayly
i did i loved you awfully i ve been loving and dreaming of you and how do you know it all beforehand
ah here the doctor goodness what will he tell us look at his face chapter vii ilusha the doctor came out of the room again muffled in his fur coat and with his cap on his head
his face looked almost angry and disgusted as though he were afraid of getting dirty he cast a cursory glance round the passage looking sternly at alyosha_karamazov and kolya_krassotkin as he did so
alyosha_karamazov waved from the door to the coachman and the carriage that had brought the doctor drove up the captain darted out after the doctor and bowing apologetically stopped him to get the last word
the poor fellow looked utterly crushed there was a scared look in his eye your excellency your excellency is it possible
yet he still gazed imploringly at the doctor as though a word from him might still change the poor boy fate
he began but could not go on and clasped his hands in despair i cant help it i am not god
the doctor answered offhand though with the customary impressiveness doctor your excellency and will it be soon soon
you must be prepared for anything said the doctor in emphatic and incisive tones and dropping his eye he was about to step out to the coach
your excellency for church_of_christ sake the terror stricken captain stopped him again your excellency but can nothing absolutely nothing save him now
it not in my hands now said the doctor impatiently but m he stopped suddenly if you could for instance send
your patient at once without delay the words at once without delay the doctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captain start to syracuse the change to the new be ne ficial climatic conditions might possibly effect
to syracuse cried the captain unable to grasp what was said syracuse is in sicily kolya_krassotkin jerked out suddenly in explanation
the doctor looked at him sicily your excellency faltered the captain but you ve seen he spread out his hands indicating his surroundings mamma and my family
no sicily is not the place for the family the family should go to caucasus in the early spring
your daughter must go to the caucasus and your wife after a course of the waters in the caucasus for her rheumatism must be sent straight to paris to the mental specialist lepelletier i could give you a note to him and then there might be a change
doctor doctor but you see the captain flung wide his hands again despairingly indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage
well that not my business grinned the doctor i have only told you the answer of medical science to your question as to possible treatment
as for the rest to my regret dont be afraid apothecary my dog wont bite you kolya_krassotkin rapped out loudly noticing the doctor rather uneasy glance at perezvon who was standing in the doorway
there was a wrathful note in kolya_krassotkin voice he used the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose and as he explained afterwards used it to insult him
what that the doctor flung up his head staring with surprise at kolya_krassotkin who this he addressed alyosha_karamazov as though asking him to explain
it perezvon master dont worry about me kolya_krassotkin said incisively again perezvon repeated the doctor perplexed he hears the bell but where it is he cannot tell
good by we shall meet in syracuse who this who this the doctor flew into a terrible rage
he is a schoolboy doctor he is a mischievous boy take no notice of him said alyosha_karamazov frowning and speaking quickly
kolya_krassotkin hold your tongue he cried to kolya_krassotkin take no notice of him doctor he repeated rather impatiently
he wants a thrashing a good thrashing the doctor stamped in a perfect fury and you know apothecary my perezvon might bite said kolya_krassotkin turning pale with quivering voice and flashing eye
ici perezvon kolya_krassotkin if you say another word i ll have nothing more to do with you alyosha_karamazov cried peremptorily
there is only one man in the world who can command nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov kolya_krassotkin this is the man kolya_krassotkin pointed to alyosha_karamazov
i obey him good by he stepped forward opened the door and quickly went into the inner room perezvon flew after him
the doctor stood still for five second in amazement looking at alyosha_karamazov then with a curse he went out quickly to the carriage repeating aloud this is this is
i dont know what it is the captain darted forward to help him into the carriage alyosha_karamazov followed kolya_krassotkin into the room
he was already by ilusha bedside the sick boy was holding his hand and calling for his father_zossima a minute later the captain too came back
ilusha faltered in violent excitement but apparently unable to go on he flung his wasted arms round his father_zossima and kolya_krassotkin uniting them in one embrace and hugging them as tightly as he could
father_zossima father come we the captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs and kolya_krassotkin lips and chin twitched
ilusha darling the doctor said you would be all right we shall be happy the doctor
father_zossima father how sorry i am for you ilusha moaned bitterly the captain began ah father_zossima i know what the new doctor said to you about me
i saw cried ilusha and again he hugged them both with all his strength hiding his face on his father_zossima shoulder
father_zossima dont cry and when i die get a good boy another one choose one of them all a good one call him ilusha and love him instead of me
but dont ever forget me father_zossima ilusha went on come to my grave and father_zossima bury me by our big stone where we used to go for our walk and come to me there with kolya_krassotkin in the evening and perezvon
hush old man you ll get well kolya_krassotkin cried suddenly in a voice that sounded angry i shall expect you
father_zossima father his voice broke they were all three silent still embracing nina was crying quietly in her chair and at last seeing them all crying mamma too burst into tears
ilusha ilusha she exclaimed kolya_krassotkin suddenly released himself from ilusha embrace good by old man mother expects me back to dinner he said quickly
but after dinner i ll come back to you for the whole day for the whole evening and i ll tell you all sort of things all sort of things
and i ll bring perezvon but now i will take him with me because he will begin to howl when i am away and bother you
what a pity i did not tell her she will be dreadfully anxious good by and he ran out into the passage
he didnt want to cry but in the passage he burst into tears alyosha_karamazov found him crying kolya_krassotkin you must be sure to keep your word and come or he will be terribly disappointed alyosha_karamazov said emphatically
i will oh how i curse myself for not having come before muttered kolya_krassotkin crying and no longer ashamed of it
at that moment the captain flew out of the room and at once closed the door behind him his face looked frenzied his lips were trembling
he stood before the two and flung up his arms i dont want a good boy i dont want another boy
he muttered in a wild whisper clenching his teeth if i forget thee jerusalem may my tongue he broke off with a sob and sank on his knees before the wooden bench
pressing his fists against his head he began sobbing with absurd whimpering cries doing his utmost that his cries should not be heard in the room
kolya_krassotkin ran out into the street good by alyosha_karamazov will you come yourself he cried sharply and angrily to alyosha_karamazov
i will certainly come in the evening what was that he said about jerusalem what did he mean by that
if i forget thee jerusalem that is if i forget all that is most precious to me if i let anything take its place then may
it from the bible i understand that enough mind you come ici perezvon he cried with positive ferocity to the dog and with rapid strides he went home
at grushenka alyosha_karamazov went towards the cathedral square to the widow morozov house to see grushenka who had sent fenya to him early in the morning with an urgent message begging him to come
during the two months that had passed since mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov arrest alyosha_karamazov had called frequently at the widow morozov house both from his own inclination and to take messages for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
book xi ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov chapter i questioning fenya alyosha_karamazov learned that her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day three day after mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov arrest grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks
she was very much changed thinner and a little sallow though she had for the past fortnight been well enough to go out
but to alyosha_karamazov her face was even more attractive than before and he liked to meet her eye when he went in to her
there were signs of a spiritual transformation in her and a steadfast fine and humble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her
there was a small vertical line between her brows which gave her charming face a look of concentrated thought almost austere at the first glance
for one whole week she was unconscious a look of firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her face there was scarcely a trace of her former frivolity
it seemed strange to alyosha_karamazov too that in spite of the calamity that had overtaken the poor girl betrothed to a man who had been arrested for a terrible crime almost at the instant of their betrothal in spite of her illness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov grushenka had not yet lost her youthful cheerfulness
there was a soft light in the once proud eye though at time they gleamed with the old vindictive fire when she was visited by one disturbing thought stronger than ever in her heart
the object of that uneasiness was the same as ever katerina_ivanovna of whom grushenka had even raved when she lay in delirium
alyosha_karamazov knew that she was fearfully jealous of her yet katerina_ivanovna had not once visited mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in his prison though she might have done it whenever she liked
all this made a difficult problem for alyosha_karamazov for he was the only person to whom grushenka opened her heart and from whom she was continually asking advice
she had returned from seeing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov half an hour before and from the rapid movement with which she leapt up from her chair to meet him
sometimes he was unable to say anything full of anxiety he entered her lodging she was at home he saw that she had been expecting him with great impatience
a pack of cards dealt for a game of fools lay on the table a bed had been made up on the leather sofa on the other side and maximov lay half reclining on it
when the homeless old man returned with grushenka from mokroe two months before he had simply stayed on and was still staying with her
he arrived with her in rain and sleet sat down on the sofa drenched and scared and gazed mutely at her with a timid appealing smile
grushenka who was in terrible grief and in the first stage of fever almost forgot his existence in all she had to do the first half hour after her arrival
he wore a dressing gown and a cotton nightcap and was evidently ill and weak though he was smiling blissfully suddenly she chanced to look at him intently
he laughed a pitiful helpless little laugh she called fenya and told her to give him something to eat all that day he sat in the same place almost without stirring
when it got dark and the shutters were closed fenya asked her mistress is the gentleman going to stay the night mistress
questioning him more in detail grushenka learned from him that he had literally nowhere to go and that mr pyotr_fomitch_kalganov my benefactor told me straight that he wouldnt receive me again and gave me five roubles
yes make him a bed on the sofa answered grushenka well god bless you you better stay then grushenka decided in her grief smiling compassionately at him
her smile wrung the old man heart and his lips twitched with grateful tears and so the destitute wanderer had stayed with her ever since
fenya and her grandmother the cook did not turn him out but went on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa
grushenka had grown used to him and coming back from seeing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov whom she had begun to visit in prison before she was really well she would sit down and begin talking to maximushka about trifling matters to keep her from thinking of her sorrow
the old man turned out to be a good story teller on occasions so that at last he became necessary to her
he did not leave the house even when she was ill grushenka saw scarcely any one else beside alyosha_karamazov who did not come every day and never stayed long
her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time at his last gasp as they said in the town and he did in fact die a week after mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov trial
three weeks before his death feeling the end approaching he made his sons their wives and child come upstairs to him at last and bade them not leave him again
from that moment he gave strict orders to his servants not to admit grushenka and to tell her if she came the master wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him
but grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him you ve come at last she cried flinging down the cards and joyfully greeting alyosha_karamazov and maximushka been scaring me that perhaps you wouldnt come
ah how i need you sit down to the table what will you have coffee yes please said alyosha_karamazov sitting down at the table
i am very hungry that right fenya fenya coffee cried grushenka it been made a long time ready for you
and bring some little pies and mind they are hot do you know we ve had a storm over those pies to day
i took them to the prison for him and would you believe it he threw them back to me he would not eat them
so i said to him i shall leave them with the warder if you dont eat them before evening it will be that your venomous spite is enough for you
he flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it with that i went away we quarreled again would you believe it
whenever i go we quarrel grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation maximov feeling nervous at once smiled and looked on the floor
what did you quarrel about this time asked alyosha_karamazov i didnt expect it in the least only fancy he is jealous of the pole
why are you keeping him he said so you ve begun keeping him he is jealous jealous of me all the time jealous eating and sleeping
he even took it into his head to be jealous of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov last week but he knew about the pole before
yes but there it is he has known about him from the very beginning but to day he suddenly got up and began scolding about him
i am ashamed to repeat what he said silly fellow mr_rakitin went in as i came out perhaps mr_rakitin is egging him on
what do you think she added carelessly he loves you that what it is he loves you so much
and now he is particularly worried i should think he might be with the trial to morrow and i went to him to say something about to morrow for i dread to think what going to happen then
you say that he is worried but how worried i am and he talks about the pole he too silly he is not jealous of maximushka yet anyway
my wife was dreadfully jealous over me too maximov put in his word jealous of you grushenka laughed in spite of herself
of whom could she have been jealous of the servant girls hold your tongue maximushka i am in no laughing mood now i feel angry
dont ogle the pies i shant give you any they are not good for you and i wont give you any vodka either
i have to look after him too just as though i kept an almshouse she laughed i dont deserve your kindness
i am a worthless creature said maximov with tears in his voice you would do better to spend your kindness on people of more use than me
ech every one is of use maximushka and how can we tell who of most use if only that pole didnt exist alyosha_karamazov
he taken it into his head to fall ill too to day i ve been to see him also and i shall send him some pies too on purpose
i hadnt sent him any but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov accused me of it so now i shall send some ah here fenya with a letter
pan mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles
in the letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum with a promise to repay it within three months signed by pan_vrublevsky as well
yes it from the poles begging again grushenka had received many such letters accompanied by such receipts from her former lover during the fortnight of her convalescence
the first letter grushenka got from them was a long one written on large notepaper and with a big family crest on the seal
it was so obscure and rhetorical that grushenka put it down before she had read half unable to make head or tail of it
but she knew that the two poles had been to ask after her health during her illness she could not attend to letters then
the first letter was followed next day by another in which pan mussyalovitch begged her for a loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period
a whole series of letters had followed one every day all as pompous and rhetorical but the loan asked for gradually diminishing dropped to a hundred roubles then to twenty five to ten and finally grushenka received a letter in which both the poles begged her for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both
grushenka left that letter too unanswered then grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them and at dusk she went round herself to their lodging
she found the two poles in great poverty almost destitution without food or fuel without cigarettes in debt to their landlady
the two hundred roubles they had carried off from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at mokroe had soon disappeared but grushenka was surprised at their meeting her with arrogant dignity and self assertion with the greatest punctilio and pompous speeches
grushenka simply laughed and gave her former admirer ten roubles then laughing she told mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov of it and he was not in the least jealous
but ever since the poles had attached themselves to grushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she had always sent them small sum
like a fool i went round to him just for a minute on the way to see mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov for he is ill too my pole grushenka began again with nervous haste
and now that day mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had taken it into his head to be fearfully jealous i was laughing telling mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov about it
fancy i said my pole had the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar he thought i would be touched and marry him
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov leapt up swearing so there i ll send them the pies fenya is it that little girl they ve sent here give her three roubles and pack a dozen pies up in a paper and tell her to take them
and you alyosha_karamazov be sure to tell mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that i did send them the pies i wouldnt tell him for anything said alyosha_karamazov smiling
ech you think he is unhappy about it why he jealous on purpose he doesnt care said grushenka bitterly on purpose queried alyosha_karamazov
i tell you you are silly alyosha_karamazov you know nothing about it with all your cleverness i am not offended that he is jealous of a girl like me
i would be offended if he were not jealous i am like that i am not offended at jealousy i have a fierce heart too
i can be jealous myself only what offends me is that he doesnt love me at all i tell you he is jealous now on purpose
he began talking to me just now of that woman of katerina_ivanovna saying she was this and that how she had ordered a doctor from moscow for him to try and save him how she had ordered the best counsel the most learned one too
am i blind dont i see so he loves her if he ll praise her to my face more shame to him
he treated me badly himself so he attacked me to make out i am in fault first and to throw it all on me
you were with your pole before me so i cant be blamed for katerina_ivanovna that what it amounts to he wants to throw the whole blame on me
he attacked me on purpose on purpose i tell you but i ll grushenka could not finish saying what she would do
well whether he loves her or not i ll soon find out for myself said grushenka with a menacing note in her voice taking the handkerchief from her eye
she hid her eye in her handkerchief and sobbed violently he doesnt love katerina_ivanovna said alyosha_karamazov firmly her face was distorted
alyosha_karamazov saw sorrowfully that from being mild and serene it had become sullen and spiteful enough of this foolishness she said suddenly it not for that i sent for you
alyosha_karamazov darling to morrow what will happen to morrow that what worries me and it only me it worries i look at every one and no one is thinking of it
no one cares about it are you thinking about it even to morrow he ll be tried you know tell me how will he be tried
you know it the valet the valet killed him good heavens can they condemn him in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him
they havent troubled the valet at all have they he been severely cross examined observed alyosha_karamazov thoughtfully but every one came to the conclusion it was not he
now he is lying very ill he has been ill ever since that attack really ill added alyosha_karamazov oh dear couldnt you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the whole thing by yourself
he been brought from petersburg for three thousand roubles they say we gave these three thousand together ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov katerina_ivanovna and i but she paid two thousand for the doctor from moscow herself
the counsel fetyukovitch would have charged more but the case has become known all over russia it talked of in all the papers and journals
fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory of the thing because the case has become so notorious i saw him yesterday
well did you talk to him grushenka put in eagerly he listened and said nothing he told me that he had already formed his opinion
but he promised to give my words consideration consideration ah they are swindlers they ll ruin him and why did she send for the doctor
they want to prove that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mad and committed the murder when he didnt know what he was doing alyosha_karamazov smiled gently but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov wont agree to that
as an expert yes but that would be the truth if he had killed him cried grushenka he was mad then perfectly mad and that was my fault wretch that i am
but of course he didnt do it he didnt do it and they are all against him the whole town even fenya evidence went to prove he had done it
and the people at the shop and that official and at the tavern too before people had heard him say so
they are all all against him all crying out against him yes there a fearful accumulation of evidence alyosha_karamazov observed grimly
and grigory_vassilyevitch grigory_vassilyevitch sticks to his story that the door was open persists that he saw it there no shaking him i went and talked to him myself
and as for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov being mad he certainly seems like it now grushenka began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air
he rude about it too yes that perhaps the strongest evidence against him said alyosha_karamazov do you know alyosha_karamazov i ve been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time
i go to him every day and simply wonder at him tell me now what do you suppose he always talking about
he talks and talks and i can make nothing of it i fancied he was talking of something intellectual that i couldnt understand in my foolishness
only he suddenly began talking to me about a babe that is about some child why is the babe poor he said
it for that babe i am going to siberia now i am not a murderer but i must go to siberia
what that meant what babe i couldnt tell for the life of me only i cried when he said it because he said it so nicely
he cried himself and i cried too he suddenly kissed me and made the sign of the cross over me what did it mean alyosha_karamazov tell me
what is this babe it must be mr_rakitin who been going to see him lately smiled alyosha_karamazov though that not mr_rakitin doing
i didnt see mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov yesterday i ll see him to day no it not mr_rakitin it his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov upsetting him
it his going to see him that what it is grushenka began and suddenly broke off alyosha_karamazov gazed at her in amazement
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov going has he been to see him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov told me himself that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov hasnt been once there there
what a girl i am blurting things out exclaimed grushenka confused and suddenly blushing stay alyosha_karamazov hush since i ve said so much i ll tell the whole truth he been to see him twice the first directly he arrived
he galloped here from moscow at once of course before i was taken ill and the second time was a week ago
he told mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov not to tell you about it under any circumstances and not to tell any one in fact he came secretly
alyosha_karamazov sat plunged in thought considering something the news evidently impressed him ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov doesnt talk to me of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov case he said slowly
and whenever i go to see him he seems vexed at my coming so i ve not been to him for the last three weeks
he said very little to me these last two months m if he was there a week ago there certainly has been a change in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov this week
there has been a change grushenka assented quickly they have a secret they have a secret mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov told me himself there was a secret and such a secret that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cant rest
before then he was cheerful and indeed he is cheerful now but when he shakes his head like that you know and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his right temple with his right hand i know there is something on his mind worrying him
i know he was cheerful before though indeed he is cheerful to day but you said he was worried yes he is worried and yet cheerful
and you know alyosha_karamazov i am constantly wondering at him with this awful thing hanging over him he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself
he keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again and did he really tell you not to tell me about ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
did he say dont tell him yes he told me dont tell him it you that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov most afraid of because it a secret he said himself it was a secret
alyosha_karamazov darling go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness
set my mind at rest that i may know the worst that in store for me that why i sent for you
you think it something to do with you if it were he wouldnt have told you there was a secret
i dont know perhaps he wants to tell me but doesnt dare to he warns me there is a secret he tells me but he wont tell me what it is
what do you think yourself what do i think it the end for me that what i think they all three have been plotting my end for katerina_ivanovna in it
it all katerina_ivanovna it all comes from her she is this and that and that means that i am not he tells me that beforehand warns me
he is planning to throw me over that the whole secret they ve planned it together the three of them mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov katerina_ivanovna and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
a week ago he suddenly told me that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was in love with katerina_ivanovna because he often goes to see her
alyosha_karamazov i ve been wanting to ask you a long time did he tell me the truth or not tell me on your conscience tell me the worst
i wont tell you a lie ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is not in love with katerina_ivanovna i think oh that what i thought
he is lying to me shameless deceiver that what it is and he was jealous of me just now so as to put the blame on me afterwards
he is stupid he cant disguise what he is doing he is so open you know but i ll give it to him i ll give it to him
you believe i did it he said he said that to me to me he reproached me with that god forgive him
you wait i ll make it hot for katerina_ivanovna at the trial i ll just say a word then i ll tell everything then
and again she cried bitterly this i can tell you for certain grushenka alyosha_karamazov said getting up first that he loves you loves you more than any one in the world and you only believe me
the second thing is that i dont want to worm his secret out of him but if he ll tell me of himself to day i shall tell him straight out that i have promised to tell you
only i fancy katerina_ivanovna has nothing to do with it and that the secret is about something else
i know i do know then i ll come to you to day and tell you that certain it isnt likely it about katerina_ivanovna it seems to me
he saw that she put little faith in his consolation but she was better for having had her sorrow out for having spoken of it
good by for now alyosha_karamazov shook hands with her grushenka was still crying he was sorry to leave her in such a state of mind but he was in haste
the first of these things was at the house of madame_hohlakov and he hurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not be too late for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
madame_hohlakov had been slightly ailing for the last three weeks her foot had for some reason swollen up and though she was not in bed she lay all day
he had a great many things to do still chapter ii the injured foot half reclining on the couch in her boudoir in a fascinating but decorous déshabillé
alyosha_karamazov had once noted with innocent amusement that in spite of her illness madame_hohlakov had begun to be rather dressy top knots ribbons loose wrappers had made their appearance and he had an inkling of the reason though he dismissed such ideas from his mind as frivolous
alyosha_karamazov had not called for four day and he was in haste to go straight to lise as it was with her
he had to speak for lise had sent a maid to him the previous day specially asking him to come to her about something very important a request which for certain reason had interest for alyosha_karamazov
but while the maid went to take his name in to lise madame_hohlakov heard of his arrival from some one and immediately sent to beg him to come to her just for one minute
alyosha_karamazov reflected that it was better to accede to the mamma request or else she would be sending down to lise room every minute that he was there
during the last two months the young official pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin had become a regular visitor at the house madame_hohlakov was lying on a couch
she was particularly smartly dressed and was evidently in a state of extreme nervous excitement she greeted alyosha_karamazov with cries of rapture
it ages ages perfect ages since i ve seen you it a whole week only think of it ah but you were here only four day ago on wednesday
you have come to see lise i sure you meant to slip into her room on tiptoe without my hearing you
my dear dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov if you only knew how worried i am about her but of that later though that the most important thing of that later
dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i trust you implicitly with my lise since the death of father_zossima god rest his soul she crossed herself i look upon you as a monk though you look charming in your new suit
forgive me for sometimes calling you alyosha_karamazov an old woman like me may take liberties she smiled coquettishly but that will do later too
where did you find such a tailor in these parts no no that not the chief thing of that later the important thing is that i shouldnt forget what is important
please remind me of it yourself as soon as my tongue runs away with me you just say the important thing
ever since lise took back her promise her childish promise alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to marry you you ve realized of course that it was only the playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to her chair thank god she can walk now that new doctor katya sent for from moscow for your unhappy brother who will to morrow
ach how do i know now what is of most importance but why speak of to morrow i am ready to die at the very thought of to morrow
ready to die of curiosity that doctor was with us yesterday and saw lise i paid him fifty roubles for the visit
but that not the point that not the point again you see i mixing everything up i am in such a hurry
why am i in a hurry i dont understand it awful how i seem growing unable to understand anything everything seems mixed up in a sort of tangle
i am afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away and that will be all i shall see of you
goodness why are we sitting here and no coffee yulia glafira coffee alyosha_karamazov made haste to thank her and said that he had only just had coffee
where at agrafena_alexandrovna at at that woman ah it she has brought ruin on every one i know nothing about it though
they say she has become a saint though it rather late in the day she had better have done it before
hush hush alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov for i have so much to say to you that i am afraid i shall tell you nothing
what use is it now this awful trial i shall certainly go i am making arrangements i shall be carried there in my chair besides i can sit up
i shall have people with me and you know i am a witness how shall i speak how shall i speak
i dont know what i shall say one has to take an oath hasnt one yes but i dont think you will be able to go
this trial this savage act and then they are all going to siberia some are getting married and all this so quickly so quickly everything changing and at last nothing
i can sit up ah you put me out ah all grow old and have death to look forward to
now she is going to follow one of your brothers to siberia and your other brother is going to follow her and will live in the nearest town and they will all torment one another
well so be it i am weary this katya cette charmante personne has disappointed all my hopes it drives me out of my mind
worst of all the publicity the story has been told a million time over in all the papers in moscow and petersburg
ah yes would you believe it there a paragraph that i was a dear friend of your brother i cant repeat the horrid word
just fancy just fancy impossible where was the paragraph what did it say i ll show you directly i got the paper and read it yesterday
i am awfully fond of gossip and i take it in and now it pays me out this is what gossip comes to
here in the petersburg paper gossip the paper began coming out this year here it is here this passage read it
it was not exactly that she was upset she seemed overwhelmed and perhaps everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her head
the paragraph was very typical and must have been a great shock to her but fortunately perhaps she was unable to keep her mind fixed on any one subject at that moment and so might race off in a minute to something else and quite forget the newspaper
and she handed alyosha_karamazov a sheet of newspaper which had been under her pillow alyosha_karamazov was well aware that the story of the terrible case had spread all over russia
what wild rumor about his brother about the karamazovs and about himself he had read in the course of those two months among other equally credible items
one paper had even stated that he had gone into a monastery and become a monk in horror at his brother crime
another contradicted this and stated that he and his elder father_zossima had broken into the monastery chest and made tracks from the monastery
and good heavens the present paragraph in the paper gossip was under the heading the alyosha_karamazov case at skotoprigonyevsk
that alas was the name of our little town i had hitherto kept it concealed it was brief and madame_hohlakov was not directly mentioned in it
it was merely stated that the criminal whose approaching trial was making such a sensation retired army captain an idle swaggerer and reactionary bully was continually involved in amorous intrigues and particularly popular with certain lady who were pining in solitude
one such lady a pining widow who tried to seem young though she had a grown up daughter was so fascinated by him that only two hours before the crime she offered him three thousand roubles on condition that he would elope with her to the gold mines
but the criminal counting on escaping punishment had preferred to murder his father_zossima to get the three thousand rather than go off to siberia with the middle aged charms of his pining lady
this playful paragraph finished of course with an outburst of generous indignation at the wickedness of parricide and at the lately abolished institution of serfdom
no names appeared in fact reading it with curiosity alyosha_karamazov folded up the paper and handed it back to madame_hohlakov
scarcely more than an hour before i suggested gold mines to him and here they talk of middle aged charms as though that were my motive
well that must be me she hurried on again of course i am meant he writes that out of spite
god almighty forgive him for the middle aged charms as i forgive him you know it do you know who it is
it your friend mr_rakitin perhaps said alyosha_karamazov though i ve heard nothing about it it he it he no perhaps about it
i know that you asked him not to visit you for the future but why it was i havent heard from you at least
you know i turned him out of the house you know all that story dont you ah then you ve heard it from him
he abuses me i suppose abuses me dreadfully yes he does but then he abuses every one but why you ve given him up
i havent heard from him either i meet him very seldom now indeed we are not friends well then i ll tell you all about it
there no help for it i ll confess for there is one point in which i was perhaps to blame only a little little point so little that perhaps it doesnt count
you see my dear boy madame_hohlakov suddenly looked arch and a charming though enigmatic smile played about her lips you see i suspect
you must forgive me alyosha_karamazov i am like a mother to you no no quite the contrary i speak to you now as though you were my father_zossima mother quite out of place
well it as though i were confessing to father_zossima that just it i called you a monk just now well that poor young man your friend mr_rakitin mercy on us
i feel cross but not very that frivolous young man would you believe it seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me
at first a month ago he only began to come oftener to see me almost every day though of course we were acquainted before
i cant be angry with him i only noticed it later i knew nothing about it and suddenly it dawned upon me and i began to notice things with surprise
you know two months ago that modest charming excellent young man pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin who in the service here began to be a regular visitor at the house
he comes once every three day not every day though i should be glad to see him every day and always so well dressed
altogether i love young people alyosha_karamazov talented modest like you and he has almost the mind of a statesman he talks so charmingly and i shall certainly certainly try and get promotion for him
you met him here ever so many time yourself and he is an excellent earnest young man isnt he he is a future diplomat
on that awful day he almost saved me from death by coming in the night and your friend mr_rakitin comes in such boots and always stretches them out on the carpet
he began hinting at his feeling in fact and one day as he was going he squeezed my hand terribly hard
he had met pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin here before and would you believe it he is always gibing at him growling at him for some reason
my foot began to swell directly after he pressed my hand like that i simply looked at the way they went on together and laughed inwardly
so i was sitting here alone no i was laid up then well i was lying here alone and suddenly mr_rakitin comes in and only fancy
brought me some verses of his own composition a short poem on my bad foot that is he described my foot in a poem
wait a minute how did it go a captivating little foot it began somehow like that i can never remember poetry i ve got it here
i ll show it to you later but it a charming thing charming and you know it not only about the foot it had a good moral too a charming idea only i ve forgotten it
in fact it was just the thing for an album so of course i thanked him and he was evidently flattered
i could see that pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin was in the way for mr_rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses
i hardly had time to thank him when in comes pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin and mr_rakitin suddenly looked as black as night i had a presentiment of it but pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin came in
but i am convinced that he guessed though he wont own it to this day and declares he had no idea
i showed pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin the verses and didnt say who was the author but he says that on purpose pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin began to laugh at once and fell to criticizing it
wretched doggerel he said they were some divinity student must have written them and with such vehemence such vehemence then instead of laughing your friend flew into a rage
good gracious i thought they ll fly at each other it was i who wrote them said he i wrote them as a joke he said for i think it degrading to write verses
they want to put a monument to your pushkin for writing about women feet while i wrote with a moral purpose and you said he are an advocate of serfdom
you have no modern enlightened feeling you are uninfluenced by progress you are a mere official he said and you take bribes
but they are good poetry you ve no humane ideas said he then i began screaming and imploring them and you know pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin is anything but a coward
he at once took up the most gentlemanly tone looked at him sarcastically listened and apologized i no idea said he
i shouldnt have said it if i had known i should have praised it poets are all so irritable he said
in short he laughed at him under cover of the most gentlemanly tone he explained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic
only as i lay there just as before you now i thought would it or would it not be the proper thing for me to turn mr_rakitin out for shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house
and would you believe it i lay here shut my eye and wondered would it be the proper thing or not
i kept worrying and worrying and my heart began to beat and i couldnt make up my mind whether to make an outcry or not
i thought he was in earnest one voice seemed to be telling me speak and the other no dont speak and no sooner had the second voice said that than i cried out and fainted
i got up suddenly and said to mr_rakitin it painful for me to say it but i dont wish to see you in my house again
of course there was a fuss so i turned him out ah alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i know myself i did wrong i was putting it on
i wasnt angry with him at all really but i suddenly fancied that was what did it that it would be such a fine scene
and yet believe me it was quite natural for i really shed tears and cried for several day afterwards and then suddenly one afternoon i forgot all about it
so it a fortnight since he been here and i kept wondering whether he would come again i wondered even yesterday then suddenly last night came this gossip
i read it and gasped who could have written it he must have written it he went home sat down wrote it on the spot sent it and they put it in
it was a fortnight ago you see but alyosha_karamazov it awful how i keep talking and dont say what i want to say
ah the words come of themselves it very important for me to be in time to see my brother to day alyosha_karamazov faltered
to be sure to be sure you bring it all back to me listen what is an aberration what aberration asked alyosha_karamazov wondering
in the legal sense an aberration in which everything is pardonable whatever you do you will be acquitted at once
what do you mean i ll tell you this katya ah she is a charming charming creature only i never can make out who it is she is in love with
she was with me some time ago and i couldnt get anything out of her especially as she wont talk to me except on the surface now
she is always talking about my health and nothing else and she takes up such a tone with me too i simply said to myself well so be it
i dont care oh yes i was talking of aberration this doctor has come you know a doctor has come of course you know it the one who discovers madmen
you wrote for him no it wasnt you but katya it all katya doing well you see a man may be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly have an aberration
he may be conscious and know what he is doing and yet be in a state of aberration and there no doubt that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was suffering from aberration
they found out about aberration as soon as the law courts were reformed it all the good effect of the reformed law courts
the doctor has been here and questioned me about that evening about the gold mines how did he seem then
he asked me he must have been in a state of aberration he came in shouting money money three thousand give me three thousand
and then went away and immediately did the murder i dont want to murder him he said and he suddenly went and murdered him
that why they ll acquit him because he struggled against it and yet he murdered him but he didnt murder him alyosha_karamazov interrupted rather sharply
he felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience yes i know it was that old man grigory_vassilyevitch murdered him
he lay as dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov struck him down and then got up saw the door open went in and killed fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
when he recovered from the blow dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov gave him on the head he was suffering from aberration he went and committed the murder
grigory_vassilyevitch cried alyosha_karamazov yes yes it was grigory_vassilyevitch but why why suffering from aberration as for his saying he didnt he very likely doesnt remember
only you know it ll be better ever so much better if dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov murdered him and that how it must have been though i say it was grigory_vassilyevitch
it certainly was dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and that better ever so much better oh not better that a son should have killed his father_zossima i dont defend that
child ought to honor their parents and yet it would be better if it were he as you have nothing to cry over then for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was conscious but did not know what he was doing
let them acquit him that so humane and would show what a blessing reformed law courts are i knew nothing about it but they say they have been so a long time
and when i heard it yesterday i was so struck by it that i wanted to send for you at once
and if he is acquitted make him come straight from the law courts to dinner with me and i ll have a party of friends and we ll drink to the reformed law courts
i dont believe he be dangerous besides i ll invite a great many friends so that he could always be led out if he did anything
and then he might be made a justice of the peace or something in another town for those who have been in trouble themselves make the best judges
nowadays you i all of us are in a state of aberration and there are ever so many examples of it a man sits singing a song suddenly something annoys him he takes a pistol and shoots the first person he comes across and no one blames him for it
and besides who isnt suffering from aberration i read that lately and all the doctors confirm it the doctors are always confirming they confirm anything
she made me cry again yesterday and the day before too and to day i suddenly realized that it all due to aberration
why my lise is in a state of aberration oh lise grieves me so i believe she quite mad why did she send for you
did she send for you or did you come of yourself yes she sent for me and i am just going to her
alyosha_karamazov got up resolutely oh my dear dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov perhaps that what most important madame_hohlakov cried suddenly bursting into tears
god knows i trust lise to you with all my heart and it no matter her sending for you on the sly without telling her mother
but forgive me i cant trust my daughter so easily to your brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov though i still consider him the most chivalrous young man
but only fancy he been to see lise and i knew nothing about it how what when alyosha_karamazov was exceedingly surprised
he had not sat down again and listened standing i will tell you that perhaps why i asked you to come for i dont know now why i did ask you to come
well ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has been to see me twice since he came back from moscow first time he came as a friend to call on me and the second time katya was here and
i didnt of course expect him to come often knowing what a lot he has to do as it is vous comprenez cette affaire et la mort terrible de votre papa
he came because he heard she was here but i suddenly heard he been here again not to see me but to see lise
that six day ago now he came stayed five minutes and went away and i didnt hear of it till three day afterwards from glafira so it was a great shock to me
i sent for lise directly she laughed he thought you were asleep she said and came in to me to ask after your health
would you believe it one night four day ago just after you saw her last time and had gone away she suddenly had a fit screaming shrieking hysterics
of course that how it happened but lise lise mercy on us how she distresses me why is it i never have hysterics
then next day another fit and the same thing on the third and yesterday too and then yesterday that aberration she suddenly screamed out i hate ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
i was struck dumb at these amazing words and answered on what grounds could i refuse to see such an excellent young man a young man of such learning too and so unfortunate for all this business is a misfortune isnt it
i insist on your never letting him come to the house again she suddenly burst out laughing at my words and so rudely you know
well i was pleased i thought i had amused her and the fits would pass off especially as i wanted to refuse to see ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov anyway on account of his strange visits without my knowledge and meant to ask him for an explanation
but early this morning lise waked up and flew into a passion with yulia and would you believe it slapped her in the face
that monstrous i am always polite to my servants and an hour later she was hugging yulia feet and kissing them
she sent a message to me that she wasnt coming to me at all and would never come and see me again and when i dragged myself down to her she rushed to kiss me crying and
as she kissed me she pushed me out of the room without saying a word so i couldnt find out what was the matter
now dear alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i rest all my hopes on you and of course my whole life is in your hands
i simply beg you to go to lise and find out everything from her as you alone can and come back and tell me me her mother for you understand it will be the death of me simply the death of me if this goes on or else i shall run away
i can stand no more i have patience but i may lose patience and then then something awful will happen
ah dear me at last pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin cried madame_hohlakov beaming all over as she saw pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin enter the room
you are late you are late well sit down speak put us out of suspense what does the counsel say where are you off to alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
to lise oh yes you wont forget you wont forget what i asked you it a question of life and death
of course i wont forget if i can but i am so late muttered alyosha_karamazov beating a hasty retreat
no be sure be sure to come in dont say if you can i shall die if you dont madame_hohlakov called after him but alyosha_karamazov had already left the room
a little demon going in to lise he found her half reclining in the invalid chair in which she had been wheeled when she was unable to walk
chapter iii she did not move to meet him but her sharp keen eye were simply riveted on his face there was a feverish look in her eye her face was pale and yellow
alyosha_karamazov was amazed at the change that had taken place in her in three day she was positively thinner she did not hold out her hand to him
he touched the thin long fingers which lay motionless on her dress then he sat down facing her without a word
i know you are in a hurry to get to the prison lise said curtly and mamma kept you there for hours
she just been telling you about me and yulia how do you know asked alyosha_karamazov i ve been listening
why do you stare at me i want to listen and i do listen there no harm in that i dont apologize
you are upset about something on the contrary i am very happy i ve only just been reflecting for the thirtieth time
what a good thing it is i refused you and shall not be your wife you are not fit to be a husband
if i were to marry you and give you a note to take to the man i loved after you you take it and be sure to give it to him and bring an answer back too
if you were forty you would still go on taking my love letters for me she suddenly laughed there is something spiteful and yet open hearted about you alyosha_karamazov smiled to her
the open heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you what more i dont want to feel ashamed with you just with you
alyosha_karamazov why is it i dont respect you i am very fond of you but i dont respect you if i respected you i shouldnt talk to you without shame should i_
no but do you believe that i am not ashamed with you no i dont believe it lise laughed nervously again she spoke rapidly
i sent your brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov some sweets in prison alyosha_karamazov you know you are quite pretty i shall love you awfully for having so quickly allowed me not to love you
why did you send for me to day lise i wanted to tell you of a longing i have i should like some one to torture me marry me and then torture me deceive me and go away
i dont want to be happy you are in love with disorder yes i want disorder i keep wanting to set fire to the house
i keep imagining how i ll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly it must be on the sly
they ll try to put it out but it ll go on burning and i shall know and say nothing ah what silliness
and how bored i am she waved her hand with a look of repulsion it your luxurious life said alyosha_karamazov softly
is it better then to be poor yes it is better that what your monk taught you that not true
let me be rich and all the rest poor i ll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to any one else
ach dont speak dont say anything she shook her hand at him though alyosha_karamazov had not opened his mouth you ve told me all that before i know it all by heart
if i am ever poor i shall murder somebody and even if i am rich i may murder some one perhaps why do nothing
it bores me but do you know i should like to reap cut the rye i ll marry you and you shall become a peasant a real peasant we ll keep a colt shall we
do you know pyotr_fomitch_kalganov yes he is always wandering about dreaming he says why live in real life it better to dream
one can dream the most delightful things but real life is a bore but he ll be married soon for all that he been making love to me already
well he just like a top he wants to be wound up and set spinning and then to be lashed lashed lashed with a whip
can you spin tops yes if i marry him i ll keep him spinning all his life you are not ashamed to be with me
no you are awfully cross because i dont talk about holy things i dont want to be holy what will they do to one in the next world for the greatest sin
you must know all about that god will censure you alyosha_karamazov was watching her steadily that just what i should like
i would go up and they would censure me and i would burst out laughing in their faces i should dreadfully like to set fire to the house alyosha_karamazov to our house you still dont believe me
there are child of twelve years old who have a longing to set fire to something and they do set things on fire too
why it a sort of disease that not true that not true there may be child but that not what i mean
you take evil for good it a passing crisis it the result of your illness perhaps you do despise me though
it simply that i dont want to do good i want to do evil and it has nothing to do with illness
why do evil so that everything might be destroyed ah how nice it would be if everything were destroyed
you know alyosha_karamazov i sometimes think of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad and i should do it for a long while on the sly and suddenly every one would find it out
every one will stand round and point their fingers at me and i would look at them all that would be awfully nice
why would it be so nice alyosha_karamazov i dont know it a craving to destroy something good or as you say to set fire to something
it happens sometimes i not only say it i shall do it i believe you ah how i love you for saying you believe me
and you are not lying one little bit but perhaps you think that i am saying all this on purpose to annoy you
no i dont think that though perhaps there is a little desire to do that in it too
there is a little i never can tell lies to you she declared with a strange fire in her eye
there was not a trace of humor or jesting in her face now though in old day fun and gayety never deserted her even at her most earnest moments
what struck alyosha_karamazov above everything was her earnestness there are moments when people love crime said alyosha_karamazov thoughtfully yes yes
you know it as though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about it ever since
you have uttered my thought they love crime every one loves crime they love it always not at some moments they all declare that they hate evil but secretly they all love it
and are you still reading nasty book yes i am mamma reads them and hides them under her pillow and i steal them
arent you ashamed to destroy yourself i want to destroy myself there a boy here who lay down between the railway lines when the train was passing
lucky fellow listen your brother is being tried now for murdering his father_zossima and every one loves his having killed his father_zossima
loves his having killed his father_zossima yes loves it every one loves it everybody says it so awful but secretly they simply love it
i for one love it there is some truth in what you say about every one said alyosha_karamazov softly
oh what ideas you have lise shrieked in delight and you a monk too you wouldnt believe how i respect you alyosha_karamazov for never telling lies
it night i am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place in all the corners under the table and they open the doors there a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me
oh i must tell you a funny dream of mine i sometimes dream of devils and they are just coming just seizing me
but i suddenly cross myself and they all draw back though they dont go away altogether they stand at the doors and in the corners waiting
and suddenly i have a frightful longing to revile god aloud and so i begin and then they come crowding back to me delighted and seize me again
and i cross myself again and they all draw back it awful fun it takes one breath away i ve had the same dream too said alyosha_karamazov suddenly
really cried lise surprised i say alyosha_karamazov dont laugh that awfully important could two different people have the same dream
it seems they can alyosha_karamazov i tell you it awfully important lise went on with really excessive amazement it not the dream that important but your having the same dream as me
you never lie to me dont lie now is it true you are not laughing it true lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was silent
alyosha_karamazov come and see me come and see me more often she said suddenly in a supplicating voice i ll always come to see you all my life answered alyosha_karamazov firmly
you are the only person i can talk to you know lise began again i talk to no one but myself and you
only you in the whole world and to you more readily than to myself and i am not a bit ashamed with you not a bit
alyosha_karamazov why am i not ashamed with you not a bit alyosha_karamazov is it true that at easter the jews steal a child and kill it
there a book here in which i read about the trial of a jew who took a child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands and then crucified him on the wall hammered nails into him and crucified him and afterwards when he was tried he said that the child died soon within four hours
i dont know that was soon he said the child moaned kept on moaning and he stood admiring it
that nice nice nice i sometimes imagine that it was i who crucified him he would hang there moaning and i would sit opposite him eating pineapple compote
i am awfully fond of pineapple compote do you like it alyosha_karamazov looked at her in silence her pale sallow face was suddenly contorted her eye burned
i kept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned a child of four years old understands you know and all the while the thought of pineapple compote haunted me
you know when i read about that jew i shook with sobs all night in the morning i wrote a letter to a certain person begging him particularly to come and see me
he came and i suddenly told him all about the child and the pineapple compote all about it all and said that it was nice
he laughed and said it really was nice then he got up and went away he was only here five minutes
did he despise me did he despise me tell me tell me alyosha_karamazov did he despise me or not she sat up on the couch with flashing eye
tell me alyosha_karamazov asked anxiously did you send for that person yes i did did you send him a letter
yes simply to ask about that about that child no not about that at all but when he came i asked him about that at once
he answered laughed got up and went away that person behaved honorably alyosha_karamazov murmured and did he despise me
did he laugh at me no for perhaps he believes in the pineapple compote himself he is very ill now too lise
yes he does believe in it said lise with flashing eye he doesnt despise any one alyosha_karamazov went on
only he does not believe any one if he doesnt believe in people of course he does despise them then he despises me me
you too good lise seemed to grind her teeth when he went out laughing i felt that it was nice to be despised
the child with fingers cut off is nice and to be despised is nice and she laughed in alyosha_karamazov face a feverish malicious laugh
do you know alyosha_karamazov do you know i should like alyosha_karamazov save me she suddenly jumped from the couch rushed to him and seized him with both hands
save me she almost groaned is there any one in the world i could tell what i ve told you
i ve told you the truth the truth i shall kill myself because i loathe everything i dont want to live because i loathe everything
i loathe everything everything alyosha_karamazov why dont you love me in the least she finished in a frenzy but i do love you answered alyosha_karamazov warmly
and will you weep over me will you yes not because i wont be your wife but simply weep for me
yes thank you it only your tears i want every one else may punish me and trample me under foot every one every one not excepting any one
for i dont love any one do you hear not any one on the contrary i hate him go alyosha_karamazov it time you went to your brother she tore herself away from him suddenly
how can i leave you like this said alyosha_karamazov almost in alarm go to your brother the prison will be shut go here your hat
he looked at her with pained surprise when he was suddenly aware of a letter in his right hand a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed
give my love to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov go go and she almost forcibly pushed alyosha_karamazov out of the door he glanced at it and instantly read the address to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov
he looked quickly at lise her face had become almost menacing give it to him you must give it to him
she ordered him trembling and beside herself to day at once or i ll poison myself that why i sent for you
alyosha_karamazov put the note in his pocket and went straight downstairs without going back to madame_hohlakov forgetting her in fact
as soon as alyosha_karamazov had gone lise unbolted the door opened it a little put her finger in the crack and slammed the door with all her might pinching her finger
ten second after releasing her finger she walked softly slowly to her chair sat up straight in it and looked intently at her blackened finger and at the blood that oozed from under the nail
and she slammed the door quickly the bolt clicked her lips were quivering and she kept whispering rapidly to herself
i am a wretch wretch wretch wretch chapter iv a hymn and a secret it was quite late day are short in november when alyosha_karamazov rang at the prison gate
it was beginning to get dusk but alyosha_karamazov knew that he would be admitted without difficulty things were managed in our little town as everywhere else
at first of course on the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry relations and a few other person could only obtain interview with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov by going through certain inevitable formalities
so much so that sometimes the interview with the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practically tęte tęte
but later though the formalities were not relaxed exceptions were made for some at least of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov visitors these exceptions however were few in number only grushenka alyosha_karamazov and mr_rakitin were treated like this
his abuse of her at mokroe weighed on the old man conscience and when he learned the whole story he completely changed his view of her
and strange to say though he was firmly persuaded of his guilt yet after mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was once in prison the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him
but the captain of the police mihail_makarovitch mihailovitch was very favorably disposed to grushenka he was a man of good heart perhaps he thought who had come to grief from drinking and dissipation
his first horror had been succeeded by pity as for alyosha_karamazov the police captain was very fond of him and had known him for a long time
mr_rakitin who had of late taken to coming very often to see the prisoner was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the police captain young lady as he called them and was always hanging about their house
he gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent too who though scrupulous in the performance of his duties was a kind hearted old man
alyosha_karamazov again had an intimate acquaintance of long standing with the superintendent who was fond of talking to him generally on sacred subjects
he respected ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and stood in awe of his opinion though he was a great philosopher himself self taught of course
during the last year the old man had taken to studying the apocryphal gospels and constantly talked over his impressions with his young friend
he used to come and see him in the monastery and discussed for hours together with him and with the monks
so even if alyosha_karamazov were late at the prison he had only to go to the superintendent and everything was made easy
but alyosha_karamazov had an irresistible attraction for him besides every one in the prison down to the humblest warder had grown used to alyosha_karamazov
the sentry of course did not trouble him so long as the authorities were satisfied when mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was summoned from his cell he always went downstairs to the place set aside for interview
as alyosha_karamazov entered the room he came upon mr_rakitin who was just taking leave of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov they were both talking loudly
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was laughing heartily as he saw him out while mr_rakitin seemed grumbling mr_rakitin did not like meeting alyosha_karamazov especially of late
seeing alyosha_karamazov enter now he frowned and looked away as though he were entirely absorbed in buttoning his big warm fur trimmed overcoat
he scarcely spoke to him and bowed to him stiffly then he began looking at once for his umbrella i must mind not to forget my belongings he muttered simply to say something
mind you dont forget other people belongings said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov as a joke and laughed at once at his own wit
you better give that advice to your own family who ve always been a slave driving lot and not to mr_rakitin he cried suddenly trembling with anger
mr_rakitin fired up instantly what the matter i was joking cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov damn it all they are all like that he turned to alyosha_karamazov nodding towards mr_rakitin hurriedly retreating figure
he was sitting here laughing and cheerful and all at once he boils up like that he didnt even nod to you
have you broken with him completely why are you so late i ve not been simply waiting but thirsting for you the whole morning
but never mind we ll make up for it now why does he come here so often surely you are not such great friends asked alyosha_karamazov
he too nodded at the door through which mr_rakitin had disappeared great friends with mr_rakitin no not as much as that
is it likely a pig like that he considers i am a blackguard they cant understand a joke either that the worst of such people
they never understand a joke and their soul are dry dry and flat they remind me of prison walls when i was first brought here
but he is a clever fellow very clever well alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov it all over with me now he sat down on the bench and made alyosha_karamazov sit down beside him
yes the trial to morrow are you so hopeless brother alyosha_karamazov said with an apprehensive feeling what are you talking about said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov looking at him rather uncertainly
till now we ve been talking of things that dont matter about this trial but i havent said a word to you about the chief thing
yes the trial is to morrow but it wasnt the trial i meant when i said it was all over with me
oh you mean the trial damn it all why do you look at me so critically what do you mean mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
ideas ideas that all ethics what is ethics ethics asked alyosha_karamazov wondering yes is it a science yes there is such a science but
i confess i cant explain to you what sort of science it is mr_rakitin knows mr_rakitin knows a lot damn him
he not going to be a monk he means to go to petersburg there he ll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency
who knows he may be of use and make his own career too ough they are first rate these people at making a career
damn ethics i am done for alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov i am you man of god i love you more than any one it makes my heart yearn to look at you
who was karl_bernard karl_bernard karl_bernard alyosha_karamazov was surprised again no not karl_bernard stay i made a mistake claude karl_bernard
what was he chemist or what he must be a savant answered alyosha_karamazov but i confess i cant tell you much about him either
i ve heard of him as a savant but what sort i dont know well damn him then i dont know either swore mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
a scoundrel of some sort most likely they are all scoundrels and mr_rakitin will make his way mr_rakitin will get on anywhere he is another karl_bernard
ugh these bernards they are all over the place but what is the matter alyosha_karamazov asked insistently he wants to write an article about me about my case and so begin his literary career
that what he comes for he said so himself he wants to prove some theory he wants to say he couldnt help murdering his father_zossima he was corrupted by his environment and so on
he explained it all to me he is going to put in a tinge of socialism he says but there damn the fellow he can put in a tinge if he likes i dont care
he cant bear ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he hates him he not fond of you either but i dont turn him out for he is a clever fellow
i said to him just now the karamazovs are not blackguards but philosophers for all true russians are philosophers and though you ve studied you are not a philosopher you are a low fellow
awfully conceited though he laughed so maliciously and i said to him de ideabus non est disputandum isnt that rather good
i can set up for being a classic you see mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov laughed suddenly why is it all over with you
the fact of it is if you take it as a whole i am sorry to lose god that why it is
you said so just now alyosha_karamazov interposed why is it all over with me m what do you mean by sorry to lose god
imagine inside in the nerves in the head that is these nerves are there in the brain damn them there are sort of little tails the little tails of those nerves and
as soon as they begin quivering that is you see i look at something with my eye and then they begin quivering
those little tails and when they quiver then an image appears it doesnt appear at once but an instant a second passes and then something like a moment appears that is not a moment devil take the moment but an image that is an object or an action damn it
that why i see and then think because of those tails not at all because i ve got a soul and that i am some sort of image and likeness
all that is nonsense mr_rakitin explained it all to me yesterday brother and it simply bowled me over it magnificent alyosha_karamazov this science
a new man arising that i understand and yet i am sorry to lose god well that a good thing anyway said alyosha_karamazov
that i am sorry to lose god it chemistry brother chemistry there no help for it your reverence you must make way for chemistry
and mr_rakitin does dislike god ough doesnt he dislike him that the sore point with all of them but they conceal it
they tell lies they pretend will you preach this in your reviews i asked him oh well if i did it openly they wont let it through he said
he laughed but what will become of man then i asked him without god and immortal life all things are lawful then they can do what they like didnt you know
a clever man knows his way about but you ve put your foot in it committing a murder and now you are rotting in prison
he said laughing a clever man can do what he likes he said he says that to my face a regular pig
i used to kick such people out but now i listen to them he talks a lot of sense too writes well
he began reading me an article last week i copied out three lines of it wait a minute here it is
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and read in order to determine this question it is above all essential to put one personality in contradiction to one reality
do you understand that no i dont said alyosha_karamazov he looked at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and listened to him with curiosity
i dont understand either it dark and obscure but intellectual every one writes like that now he says it the effect of their environment
they are afraid of the environment he writes poetry too the rascal he written in honor of madame_hohlakov foot ha ha ha
i ve heard about it said alyosha_karamazov have you and have you heard the poem no i ve got it here it is
i ll read it to you you dont know i havent told you there quite a story about it he a rascal three weeks ago he began to tease me
you ve got yourself into a mess like a fool for the sake of three thousand but i going to collar a hundred and fifty thousand
i am going to marry a widow and buy a house in petersburg and he told me he was courting madame_hohlakov
she hadnt much brains in her youth and now at forty she has lost what she had but she awfully sentimental he says that how i shall get hold of her
when i marry her i shall take her to petersburg and there i shall start a newspaper and his mouth was simply watering the beast not for the widow but for the hundred and fifty thousand
and he made me believe it he came to see me every day she is coming round he declared he was beaming with delight
and then all of a sudden he was turned out of the house pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin carrying everything before him bravo i could kiss the silly old noodle for turning him out of the house
and he had written this doggerel it the first time i ve soiled my hands with writing poetry he said
it to win her heart so it in a good cause when i get hold of the silly woman fortune i can be of great social utility
they have this social justification for every nasty thing they do anyway it better than your pushkin poetry he said for i ve managed to advocate enlightenment even in that
i understand what he means about pushkin i quite see that if he really was a man of talent and only wrote about women feet
but wasnt mr_rakitin stuck up about his doggerel the vanity of these fellows on the convalescence of the swollen foot of the object of my affections he thought of that for a title
he a waggish fellow a captivating little foot though swollen and red and tender the doctors come and plasters put but still they cannot mend her
yet tis not for her foot i dread a theme for pushkin muse more fit it not her foot it is her head i tremble for her loss of wit
for as her foot swells strange to say her intellect is on the wane oh for some remedy i pray that may restore both foot and brain
he is a pig a regular pig but he very arch the rascal and he really has put in a progressive idea
and wasnt he angry when she kicked him out he was gnashing his teeth he taken his revenge already said alyosha_karamazov
he written a paragraph about madame_hohlakov and alyosha_karamazov told him briefly about the paragraph in gossip
that his doing that his doing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov assented frowning that him these paragraphs i know the insulting things that have been written about grushenka for instance
and about katya too m he walked across the room with a harassed air brother i cannot stay long alyosha_karamazov said after a pause
to morrow will be a great and awful day for you the judgment of god will be accomplished i am amazed at you you walk about here talking of
i dont know what no dont be amazed at me mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov broke in warmly am i to talk of that stinking dog
of the murderer we ve talked enough of him i dont want to say more of the stinking son of stinking lizaveta
god will kill him you will see hush he went up to alyosha_karamazov excitedly and kissed him his eye glowed
mr_rakitin wouldnt understand it he began in a sort of exaltation but you you ll understand it all that why i was thirsting for you
you see there so much i ve been wanting to tell you for ever so long here within these peeling walls but i havent said a word about what matters most
the moment never seems to have come now i can wait no longer i must pour out my heart to you
he was hidden in me but would never have come to the surface if it hadnt been for this blow from heaven
brother these last two months i ve found in myself a new man a new man has risen up in me i am afraid
i am not a bit afraid of that it something else i am afraid of now that that new man may leave me
even there in the mines under ground i may find a human heart in another convict and murderer by my side and i may make friends with him for even there one may live and love and suffer
one may thaw and revive a frozen heart in that convict one may wait upon him for years and at last bring up from the dark depths a lofty soul a feeling suffering creature one may bring forth an angel create a hero
and what do i care if i spend twenty years in the mines breaking ore with a hammer there are so many of them hundreds of them and we are all to blame for them
why was it i dreamed of that babe at such a moment why is the babe so poor that was a sign to me at that moment
it for the babe i going because we are all responsible for all for all the babes for there are big child as well as little child
all are babes i go for all because some one must go for all i didnt kill father_zossima but i ve got to go
i accept it it all come to me here here within these peeling walls there are numbers of them there hundreds of them underground with hammers in their hands
oh yes we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom but then in our great sorrow we shall rise again to joy without which man cannot live nor god exist for god gives joy
it his privilege a grand one ah man should be dissolved in prayer what should i be underground there without god
mr_rakitin laughing if they drive god from the earth we shall shelter him underground one cannot exist in prison without god it even more impossible than out of prison
and then we man underground will sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to god with whom is joy
hail to god and his joy i love him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was almost gasping for breath as he uttered his wild speech
he turned pale his lips quivered and tears rolled down his cheeks yes life is full there is life even underground he began again
you wouldnt believe alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov how i want to live now what a thirst for existence and consciousness has sprung up in me within these peeling walls
mr_rakitin doesnt understand that all he cares about is building a house and letting flats but i ve been longing for you
and what is suffering i am not afraid of it even if it were beyond reckoning i am not afraid of it now
and i seem to have such strength in me now that i think i could stand anything any suffering only to be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment i exist
i was afraid of it before do you know perhaps i wont answer at the trial at all in thousands of agonies i exist
i tormented on the rack but i exist though i sit alone on a pillar i exist i see the sun and if i dont see the sun i know it there
and there a whole life in that in knowing that the sun is there alyosha_karamazov my angel all these philosophies are the death of me
damn them brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov what of brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov interrupted alyosha_karamazov but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov did not hear you see i never had any of these doubts before but it was all hidden away in me
it was perhaps just because ideas i did not understand were surging up in me that i used to drink and fight and rage
it was to stifle them in myself to still them to smother them ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is not mr_rakitin there is an idea in him
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is a sphinx and is silent he is always silent it god that worrying me that the only thing that worrying me
what if he doesnt exist what if mr_rakitin right that it an idea made up by man then if he doesnt exist man is the chief of the earth of the universe
magnificent only how is he going to be good without god that the question i always come back to that for whom is man going to love then
to whom will he be thankful to whom will he sing the hymn mr_rakitin laughs mr_rakitin says that one can love humanity without god
well only a sniveling idiot can maintain that i cant understand it life easy for mr_rakitin you better think about the extension of civic rights or even of keeping down the price of meat
i answered him well but you without a god are more likely to raise the price of meat if it suits you and make a rouble on every copeck
you will show your love for humanity more simply and directly by that than by philosophy he lost his temper but after all what is goodness
answer me that alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov goodness is one thing with me and another with a chinaman so it a relative thing or isnt it
is it not relative a treacherous question you wont laugh if i tell you it kept me awake two nights i only wonder now how people can live and think nothing about it
vanity ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has no god he has an idea it beyond me but he is silent i believe he is a free mason
i asked him but he is silent i wanted to drink from the springs of his soul he was silent but once he did drop a word
what did he say alyosha_karamazov took it up quickly i said to him then everything is lawful if it is so
he frowned fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov our papa he said was a pig but his ideas were right enough that was what he dropped
that was all he said that was going one better than mr_rakitin yes alyosha_karamazov assented bitterly when was he with you
of that later now i must speak of something else i have said nothing about ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to you before i put it off to the last
when my business here is over and the verdict has been given then i ll tell you something i ll tell you everything
we ve something tremendous on hand and you shall be my judge in it but dont begin about that now be silent
you talk of to morrow of the trial but would you believe it i know nothing about it have you talked to the counsel
what the use of the counsel i told him all about it he a soft city bred rogue a karl_bernard but he doesnt believe me not a bit of it
only imagine he believes i did it i see it in that case i asked him why have you come to defend me
hang them all they ve got a doctor down too want to prove i mad i wont have that katerina_ivanovna wants to do her duty to the end whatever the strain
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov smiled bitterly the cat hard hearted creature she knows that i said of her at mokroe that she was a woman of great wrath
they repeated it yes the facts against me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea grigory_vassilyevitch sticks to his point
grigory_vassilyevitch honest but a fool many people are honest because they are fools that mr_rakitin idea grigory_vassilyevitch my enemy and there are some people who are better as foes than friends
i mean katerina_ivanovna i am afraid oh i am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand
she ll pay it back to the last farthing i dont want her sacrifice they ll put me to shame at the trial
i wonder how i can stand it go to her alyosha_karamazov ask her not to speak of that in the court cant you
but damn it all it doesnt matter i shall get through somehow i dont pity her it her own doing she deserves what she gets
i shall have my own story to tell alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov he smiled bitterly again only only grusha grusha good lord
why should she have such suffering to bear he exclaimed suddenly with tears grusha killing me the thought of her killing me killing me
she was with me just now she told me she was very much grieved by you to day i know confound my temper
it was jealousy i was sorry i kissed her as she was going i didnt ask her forgiveness why didnt you exclaimed alyosha_karamazov
suddenly mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov laughed almost mirthfully god preserve you my dear boy from ever asking forgiveness for a fault from a woman you love
from one you love especially however greatly you may have been in fault for a woman devil only knows what to make of a woman
i know something about them anyway but try acknowledging you are in fault to a woman say i am sorry forgive me and a shower of reproaches will follow
nothing will make her forgive you simply and directly she ll humble you to the dust bring forward things that have never happened recall everything forget nothing add something of her own and only then forgive you
and even the best the best of them do it she ll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head
they are ready to flay you alive i tell you every one of them all these angels without whom we cannot live
i tell you plainly and openly dear boy every decent man ought to be under some woman thumb that my conviction not conviction but feeling
a man ought to be magnanimous and it no disgrace to a man no disgrace to a hero not even a cćsar
but dont ever beg her pardon all the same for anything remember that rule given you by your brother mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov who come to ruin through women
no i better make it up to grusha somehow without begging pardon i worship her alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov worship her only she doesnt see it
no she still thinks i dont love her enough and she tortures me tortures me with her love the past was nothing
in the past it was only those infernal curves of her that tortured me but now i ve taken all her soul into my soul and through her i ve become a man myself
will they marry us if they dont i shall die of jealousy i imagine something every day what did she say to you about me
alyosha_karamazov repeated all grushenka had said to him that day mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov listened made him repeat things and seemed pleased then she is not angry at my being jealous
he exclaimed she is a regular woman i ve a fierce heart myself ah i love such fierce hearts though i cant bear any one being jealous of me
i cant endure it we shall fight but i shall love her i shall love her infinitely will they marry us
do they let convicts marry that the question and without her i cant exist mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov walked frowning across the room
it was almost dark he suddenly seemed terribly worried so there a secret she says a secret we have got up a plot against her and katya is mixed up in it she thinks
no my good grushenka that not it you are very wide of the mark in your foolish feminine way alyosha_karamazov darling well here goes
he looked round went close up quickly to alyosha_karamazov who was standing before him and whispered to him with an air of mystery though in reality no one could hear them the old warder was dozing in the corner and not a word could reach the ears of the soldiers on guard
i ll tell you our secret i will tell you all our secret mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov whispered hurriedly i meant to tell you later for how could i decide on anything without you
you are everything to me though i say that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is superior to us you are my angel it your decision will decide it
you see it a question of conscience question of the higher conscience the secret is so important that i cant settle it myself and i ve put it off till i could speak to you
perhaps it you that is superior and not ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but anyway it too early to decide now for we must wait for the verdict
as soon as the verdict is given you shall decide my fate dont decide it now i ll tell you now you listen but dont decide
stand and keep quiet i wont tell you everything i ll only tell you the idea without details and you keep quiet
not a question not a movement you agree but goodness what shall i do with your eye i afraid your eye will tell me your decision even if you dont speak
oo i afraid alyosha_karamazov listen ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suggests my escaping i wont tell you the details it all been thought out it can all be arranged
hush dont decide i should go to america with grusha you know i cant live without grusha what if they wont let her follow me to siberia
do they let convicts get married ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov thinks not and without grusha what should i do there underground with a hammer
i should only smash my skull with the hammer but on the other hand my conscience i should have run away from suffering
a sign has come i reject the sign i have a way of salvation and i turn my back on it
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov says that in america with the good will i can be of more use than underground but what becomes of our hymn from underground
what america america is vanity again and there a lot of swindling in america too i expect i should have run away from crucifixion
i tell you you know alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov because you are the only person who can understand this there no one else it folly madness to others all i ve told you of the hymn
they ll say i out of my mind or a fool i am not out of my mind and i am not a fool
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov understands about the hymn too he understands only he doesnt answer he doesnt speak he doesnt believe in the hymn dont speak dont speak
i see how you look you have already decided dont decide spare me i cant live without grusha wait till after the trial
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ended beside himself he held alyosha_karamazov with both hands on his shoulders and his yearning feverish eye were fixed on his brother
they dont let convicts marry do they he repeated for the third time in a supplicating voice alyosha_karamazov listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved
tell me one thing he said is ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov very keen on it and whose idea was it his his and he is very keen on it
he didnt come to see me at first then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away
he doesnt doubt of my obeying him though i showed him all my heart as i have to you and told him about the hymn too
he is awfully keen on it he doesnt ask me but orders me to escape he told me he arrange it he found out about everything
but of that later he simply set on it it all a matter of money he ll pay ten thousand for escape and give me twenty thousand for america
and he says we can arrange a magnificent escape for ten thousand and he told you on no account to tell me
alyosha_karamazov asked again to tell no one and especially not you on no account to tell you he is afraid no doubt that you ll stand before me as my conscience
dont tell him i told you dont tell him for anything you are right alyosha_karamazov pronounced it impossible to decide anything before the trial is over
a new man or a karl_bernard who ll decide la karl_bernard for i believe i a contemptible karl_bernard myself said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with a bitter grin
after the trial you ll decide of yourself then you ll find that new man in yourself and he will decide but brother have you no hope then of being acquitted
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov shrugged his shoulders nervously and shook his head alyosha_karamazov darling it time you were going he said with a sudden haste
there the superintendent shouting in the yard he ll be here directly we are late it irregular embrace me quickly kiss me
sign me with the cross darling for the cross i have to bear to morrow they embraced and kissed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly suggests my escaping but of course he believes i did it
a mournful smile came on to his lips have you asked him whether he believes it asked alyosha_karamazov
no i havent i wanted to but i couldnt i hadnt the courage but i saw it from his eye well good by
once more they kissed hurriedly and alyosha_karamazov was just going out when mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly called him back stand facing me
that right and again he seized alyosha_karamazov putting both hands on his shoulders his face became suddenly quite pale so that it was dreadfully apparent even through the gathering darkness
his lips twitched his eye fastened upon alyosha_karamazov alyosha tell me the whole truth as you would before god do you believe i did it
do you do you in yourself believe it the whole truth dont lie he cried desperately everything seemed heaving before alyosha_karamazov and he felt something like a stab at his heart
hush what do you mean he faltered helplessly the whole truth the whole dont lie repeated mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
i ve never for one instant believed that you were the murderer broke in a shaking voice from alyosha_karamazov breast and he raised his right hand in the air as though calling god to witness his words
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov whole face was lighted up with bliss thank you he articulated slowly as though letting a sigh escape him after fainting
now you have given me new life would you believe it till this moment i ve been afraid to ask you you even you
well go you ve given me strength for to morrow god bless you come go along love ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov last word
such distrustfulness in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov such lack of confidence even to him to alyosha_karamazov all this suddenly opened before alyosha_karamazov an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his unhappy brother
alyosha_karamazov went out in tears intense infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly there was a poignant ache in his torn heart
love ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he suddenly recalled mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov words and he was going to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he badly wanted to see ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov all day he was as much worried about ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov as about mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and more than ever now
chapter not you not you on the way to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he had to pass the house where katerina_ivanovna was living
there was light in the windows he suddenly stopped and resolved to go in he had not seen katerina_ivanovna for more than a week
ringing and mounting the staircase which was dimly lighted by a chinese lantern he saw a man coming down and as they met he recognized him as his brother
but now it struck him that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov might be with her especially on the eve of the terrible day so he was just coming from katerina_ivanovna
ah it only you said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dryly well good by you are going to her yes i dont advise you to she upset and you ll upset her more
a door was instantly flung open above and a voice cried suddenly no no alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov have you come from him
yes i have been with him has he sent me any message come up alyosha_karamazov and you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you must come back you must
there was such a peremptory note in katya voice that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov after a moment hesitation made up his mind to go back with alyosha_karamazov
do you hear she was listening he murmured angrily to himself but alyosha_karamazov heard it excuse my keeping my greatcoat on said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov going into the drawing room
i wont sit down i wont stay more than a minute sit down alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said katerina_ivanovna though she remained standing
she had changed very little during this time but there was an ominous gleam in her dark eye alyosha_karamazov remembered afterwards that she had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment
only one thing said alyosha_karamazov looking her straight in the face that you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what he was a little confused
what did he ask you to tell me passed between you at the time of your first acquaintance in that town
ah that i bowed down to the ground for that money she broke into a bitter laugh why is he afraid for me or for himself
he asks me to spare whom him or myself tell me alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov watched her intently trying to understand her
both yourself and him he answered softly i am glad to hear it she snapped out maliciously and she suddenly blushed
you dont know me yet alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov she said menacingly and i dont know myself yet perhaps you ll want to trample me under foot after my examination to morrow
only an hour ago i was thinking i felt afraid to touch that monster as though he were a reptile
you will give your evidence honorably said alyosha_karamazov that all that wanted women are often dishonorable she snarled but no he is still a human being to me
but did he do it is he the murderer she cried all of a sudden hysterically turning quickly to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
alyosha_karamazov saw at once that she had asked ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that question before perhaps only a moment before he came in and not for the first time but for the hundredth and that they had ended by quarreling
i ve been to see smerdyakov it was you you who persuaded me that he murdered his father_zossima it only you i believed
she continued still addressing ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he gave her a sort of strained smile alyosha_karamazov started at her tone he had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them
well that enough anyway ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cut short the conversation i am going i ll come to morrow and turning at once he walked out of the room and went straight downstairs
with an imperious gesture katerina_ivanovna seized alyosha_karamazov by both hands follow him overtake him dont leave him alone for a minute
she said in a hurried whisper he mad dont you know that he mad he is in a fever nervous fever
the doctor told me so go run after him alyosha_karamazov jumped up and ran after ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov who was not fifty paces ahead of him
what do you want he turned quickly on alyosha_karamazov seeing that he was running after him she told you to catch me up because i mad
i know it all by heart he added irritably she is mistaken of course but she is right that you are ill said alyosha_karamazov
i was looking at your face just now you look very ill ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan walked on without stopping alyosha_karamazov followed him
and do you know alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how people do go out of their mind ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov asked in a voice suddenly quiet without a trace of irritation with a note of the simplest curiosity
no i dont i suppose there are all kind of insanity and can one observe that one going mad oneself
i imagine one cant see oneself clearly in such circumstances alyosha_karamazov answered with surprise ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov paused for half a minute
oh while i think of it i have a letter for you said alyosha_karamazov timidly and he took lise note from his pocket and held it out to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
if you want to talk to me please change the subject he said suddenly they were just under a lamp post
ah from that little demon he laughed maliciously and without opening the envelope he tore it into bits and threw it in the air
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov recognized the handwriting at once the bits were scattered by the wind she not sixteen yet i believe and already offering herself he said contemptuously striding along the street again
how do you mean offering herself exclaimed alyosha_karamazov as wanton women offer themselves to be sure how can you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov how can you
alyosha_karamazov cried warmly in a grieved voice she is a child you are insulting a child she is ill she is very ill too
she is on the verge of insanity too perhaps i had hoped to hear something from you that would save her
you ll hear nothing from me if she is a child i am not her nurse be quiet alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov dont go on about her
she will be praying all night now to the mother of god to show her how to act to morrow at the trial he said sharply and angrily again
i am not even thinking about it they were silent again for a moment you you mean katerina_ivanovna
yes whether she to save mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov or ruin him she ll pray for light from above she cant make up her mind for herself you see
she has not had time to decide yet she takes me for her nurse too she wants me to sing lullabies to her
katerina_ivanovna loves you brother said alyosha_karamazov sadly perhaps but i am not very keen on her she is suffering
why do you sometimes say things to her that give her hope alyosha_karamazov went on with timid reproach
i know that you ve given her hope forgive me for speaking to you like this he added i cant behave to her as i ought break off altogether and tell her so straight out said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov irritably
if i break off with her now she will avenge herself on me by ruining that scoundrel to morrow at the trial for she hates him and knows she hates him
as long as i dont break off with her she goes on hoping and she wont ruin that monster knowing how i want to get him out of trouble
i must wait till sentence is passed on the murderer it all a lie lie upon lie if only that damned verdict would come
the words murderer and monster echoed painfully in alyosha_karamazov heart but how can she ruin mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he asked pondering on ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov words
what evidence can she give that would ruin mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov you dont know that yet she got a document in her hands in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov own writing that proves conclusively that he did murder fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
that impossible cried alyosha_karamazov why is it impossible i ve read it myself there cant be such a document
alyosha_karamazov repeated warmly there cant be because he not the murderer it not he murdered father_zossima not he ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly stopped
who is the murderer then according to you he asked with apparent coldness there was even a supercilious note in his voice
you know who alyosha_karamazov pronounced in a low penetrating voice who you mean the myth about that crazy idiot the epileptic smerdyakov
alyosha_karamazov suddenly felt himself trembling all over you know who broke helplessly from him he could scarcely breathe who
who ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried almost fiercely all his restraint suddenly vanished i only know one thing alyosha_karamazov went on still almost in a whisper it wasnt you killed father_zossima
not you what do you mean by not you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was thunderstruck it was not you killed father_zossima not you
alyosha_karamazov repeated firmly the silence lasted for half a minute i know i didnt are you raving said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a pale distorted smile
his eye were riveted on alyosha_karamazov they were standing again under a lamp post no ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you ve told yourself several time that you are the murderer
you ve said so to yourself many time when you ve been alone during these two dreadful months alyosha_karamazov went on softly and distinctly as before
yet he was speaking now as it were not of himself not of his own will but obeying some irresistible command
when did i say so i was in moscow when have i said so ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov faltered helplessly you have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no one else
but you didnt do it you are mistaken you are not the murderer do you hear it was not you god has sent me to tell you so
they were both silent the silence lasted a whole long minute they were both standing still gazing into each other eye
they were both pale suddenly ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov began trembling all over and clutched alyosha_karamazov shoulder you ve been in my room
he whispered hoarsely you ve been there at night when he came confess have you seen him have you seen him
whom do you mean mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov alyosha_karamazov asked bewildered not him damn the monster ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov shouted in a frenzy do you know that he visits me
how did you find out speak who is he i dont know whom you are talking about alyosha_karamazov faltered beginning to be alarmed
yes you do know or how could you it impossible that you dont know suddenly he seemed to check himself
he stood still and seemed to reflect a strange grin contorted his lips brother alyosha_karamazov began again in a shaking voice i have said this to you
because you ll believe my word i know that i tell you once and for all it not you you hear once for all
god has put it into my heart to say this to you even though it may make you hate me from this hour
but by now ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had apparently regained his self control alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he said with a cold smile i cant endure prophets and epileptics messengers from god especially and you know that
only too well i break off all relations with you from this moment and probably for ever i beg you to leave me at this turning
it the way to your lodgings too you better be particularly careful not to come to me to day do you hear
he turned and walked on with a firm step not looking back brother alyosha_karamazov called after him if anything happens to you to day turn to me before any one
but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov made no reply alyosha_karamazov stood under the lamp post at the cross roads till ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had vanished into the darkness
then he turned and walked slowly homewards both alyosha_karamazov and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov were living in lodgings neither of them was willing to live in fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov empty house
he had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge attached to a fine house that belonged to a well to do lady the widow of an official
but his only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone who went to bed at six clock every evening and got up at six in the morning
alyosha_karamazov had a furnished room in the house of some working people ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov lived some distance from him ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had become remarkably indifferent to his comforts of late and very fond of being alone
he did everything for himself in the one room he lived in and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his abode
he reached the gate of the house and had his hand on the bell when he suddenly stopped he felt that he was trembling all over with anger
suddenly he let go of the bell turned back with a curse and walked with rapid steps in the opposite direction
he walked a mile and a half to a tiny slanting wooden house almost a hut where marya_kondratyevna the neighbor who used to come to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov kitchen for soup and to whom smerdyakov had once sung his songs and played on the guitar was now lodging
she had sold their little house and was now living here with her mother smerdyakov who was ill almost dying had been with them ever since fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov death
it was to him ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was going now drawn by a sudden and irresistible prompting chapter vi the first interview with smerdyakov
the first time he had seen him and talked to him was on the first day of his arrival then he had visited him once more a fortnight later
but his visits had ended with that second one so that it was now over a month since he had seen him
this was the third time that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had been to see smerdyakov since his return from moscow and he had scarcely heard anything of him
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had only returned five day after his father_zossima death so that he was not present at the funeral which took place the day before he came back
the cause of his delay was that alyosha_karamazov not knowing his moscow address had to apply to katerina_ivanovna to telegraph to him and she not knowing his address either telegraphed to her sister and aunt reckoning on ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov going to see them as soon as he arrived in moscow
but he did not go to them till four day after his arrival when he got the telegram he had of course set off post haste to our town
the first to meet him was alyosha_karamazov and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was greatly surprised to find that in opposition to the general opinion of the town he refused to entertain a suspicion against mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and spoke openly of smerdyakov as the murderer
later on after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor and hearing the details of the charge and the arrest he was still more surprised at alyosha_karamazov and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated brotherly feeling and sympathy with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov of whom alyosha_karamazov as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knew was very fond
he positively disliked him at most felt sometimes a compassion for him and even that was mixed with great contempt almost repugnance
by the way let us say a word or two of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov feeling to his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov whole personality even his appearance was extremely unattractive to him
yet he went to see mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov on the first day of his arrival and that interview far from shaking ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov belief in his guilt positively strengthened it
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov looked with indignation on katerina_ivanovna love for his brother he found his brother agitated nervously excited mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had been talkative but very absent minded and incoherent
he used violent language accused smerdyakov and was fearfully muddled he talked principally about the three thousand roubles which he said had been stolen from him by his father_zossima
the money was mine it was my money mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov kept repeating even if i had stolen it i should have had the right
he hardly contested the evidence against him and if he tried to turn a fact to his advantage it was in an absurd and incoherent way
quite the contrary he was angry and proudly scornful of the charge against him he was continually firing up and abusing every one
he only laughed contemptuously at grigory_vassilyevitch evidence about the open door and declared that it was the devil that opened it
he hardly seemed to wish to defend himself to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov or any one else but he could not bring forward any coherent explanation of the fact
he even succeeded in insulting ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov during their first interview telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared that everything was lawful to suspect and question him
altogether he was anything but friendly with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov on that occasion immediately after that interview with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went for the first time to see smerdyakov
in the railway train on his way from moscow he kept thinking of smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he went away
many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious but when he gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said nothing for the time of that conversation
doctor herzenstube and varvinsky the doctor he met in the hospital confidently asserted in reply to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov persistent questions that smerdyakov epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine and were surprised indeed at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov asking whether he might not have been shamming on the day of the catastrophe
they gave him to understand that the attack was an exceptional one the fits persisting and recurring several time so that the patient life was positively in danger and it was only now after they had applied remedies that they could assert with confidence that the patient would survive
though it might well be added doctor herzenstube that his reason would be impaired for a considerable period if not permanently
on ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov asking impatiently whether that meant that he was now mad they told him that this was not yet the case in the full sense of the word but that certain abnormalities were perceptible
he put that off till he had seen smerdyakov who was at that time in the hospital ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov decided to find out for himself what those abnormalities were
at the hospital he was at once allowed to see the patient smerdyakov was lying on a truckle bed in a separate ward
there was only one other bed in the room and in it lay a tradesman of the town swollen with dropsy who was obviously almost dying he could be no hindrance to their conversation
smerdyakov grinned uncertainly on seeing ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and for the first instant seemed nervous so at least ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov fancied but that was only momentary
for the rest of the time he was struck on the contrary by smerdyakov composure from the first glance ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had no doubt that he was very ill
he was very weak he spoke slowly seeming to move his tongue with difficulty he was much thinner and sallower throughout the interview which lasted twenty minutes he kept complaining of headache and of pain in all his limbs
his thin emasculate face seemed to have become so tiny his hair was ruffled and his crest of curls in front stood up in a thin tuft
but in the left eye which was screwed up and seemed to be insinuating something smerdyakov showed himself unchanged it always worth while speaking to a clever man
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was reminded of that at once he sat down on the stool at his feet smerdyakov with painful effort shifted his position in bed but he was not the first to speak
he remained dumb and did not even look much interested can you talk to me asked ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i wont tire you much
certainly i can mumbled smerdyakov in a faint voice has your honor been back long he added patronizingly as though encouraging a nervous visitor
i only arrived to day to see the mess you are in here smerdyakov sighed why do you sigh
you knew of it all along ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov blurted out smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while how could i help knowing
it was clear beforehand but how could i tell it would turn out like that what would turn out dont prevaricate
you ve foretold you have a fit on the way down to the cellar you know you mentioned the very spot
have you said so at the examination yet smerdyakov queried with composure ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov felt suddenly angry no i havent yet but i certainly shall
you must explain a great deal to me my man and let me tell you i am not going to let you play with me
why should i play with you when i put my whole trust in you as in god almighty said smerdyakov with the same composure only for a moment closing his eye
in the first place began ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i know that epileptic fits cant be told beforehand i ve inquired dont try and take me in
you cant foretell the day and the hour how was it you told me the day and the hour beforehand and about the cellar too
how could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit if you didnt sham a fit on purpose
i had to go to the cellar anyway several time a day indeed smerdyakov drawled deliberately i fell from the garret just in the same way a year ago
it quite true you cant tell the day and hour of a fit beforehand but you can always have a presentiment of it
but you did foretell the day and the hour in regard to my epilepsy sir you had much better inquire of the doctors here
you can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham it no use my saying any more about it
and the cellar how could you know beforehand of the cellar you dont seem able to get over that cellar
as i was going down to the cellar i was in terrible dread and doubt what frightened me most was losing you and being left without defense in all the world
so i went down into the cellar thinking here it ll come on directly it ll strike me down directly shall i fall
and it was through this fear that i suddenly felt the spasm that always comes and so i went flying
when i told you how frightened i was and spoke of the cellar i told all that to doctor herzenstube and nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov the investigating lawyer and it all been written down in the protocol
and the doctor here mr varvinsky maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it brought it on the apprehension that i might fall
all that and all my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before it was just then that the fit seized me
and so they ve written it down that it just how it must have happened simply from my fear as he finished smerdyakov drew a deep breath as though exhausted
he had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their conversation and it appeared that smerdyakov had already reported it all himself
then you have said all that in your evidence said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov somewhat taken aback what have i to be afraid of
let them write down the whole truth smerdyakov pronounced firmly and have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate
no not to say every word and did you tell them that you can sham fits as you boasted then
no i didnt tell them that either tell me now why did you send me then to tchermashnya i was afraid you go away to moscow tchermashnya is nearer anyway
you are lying you suggested my going away yourself you told me to get out of the way of trouble that was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you foreseeing trouble in the house to spare you
that why i told you to get out of harm way that you might understand that there would be trouble in the house and would remain at home to protect your father_zossima
only i wanted to spare myself even more you might have said it more directly you blockhead ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly fired up
how could i have said it more directly then it was simply my fear that made me speak and you might have been angry too
i might well have been apprehensive that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov would make a scene and carry away that money for he considered it as good as his own but who could tell that it would end in a murder like this
i thought that he would only carry off the three thousand that lay under the master mattress in the envelope and you see he murdered him
how could you guess it either sir but if you say yourself that it couldnt be guessed how could i have guessed and stayed at home
you contradict yourself said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov pondering you might have guessed from my sending you to tchermashnya and not to moscow
how could i guess it from that smerdyakov seemed much exhausted and again he was silent for a minute
you might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to moscow but to tchermashnya that i wanted to have you nearer for moscow a long way off and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knowing you are not far off would not be so bold
and if anything had happened you might have come to protect me too for i warned you of grigory_vassilyevitch illness and that i was afraid of having a fit
and when i explained those knocks to you by means of which one could go in to the deceased and that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knew them all through me i thought that you would guess yourself that he would be sure to do something and so wouldnt go to tchermashnya even but would stay
he talks very coherently thought ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov though he does mumble what the derangement of his faculties that herzenstube talked of
you are cunning with me damn you he exclaimed getting angry but i thought at the time that you quite guessed smerdyakov parried with the simplest air
why i thought that it was because you guessed that you went away in such a hurry only to get out of trouble only to run away and save yourself in your fright
if i guessed i should have stayed cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you think that every one is as great a coward as yourself
and i did guess there was some mischief brewing on your part only you are lying you are lying again he cried suddenly recollecting
do you remember how you went up to the carriage and said to me it always worth while speaking to a clever man
forgive me i thought you were like me of course i ought to have guessed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said in agitation so you were glad i went away since you praised me
if i was pleased he articulated rather breathlessly it was simply because you agreed not to go to moscow but to tchermashnya
smerdyakov sighed again and again a trace of color came into his face for it was nearer anyway only when i said these words to you it was not by way of praise but of reproach
why that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father_zossima and would not protect us for i might have been taken up any time for stealing that three thousand
you didnt understand it what reproach damn you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov swore again stay did you tell the prosecutor and the investigating lawyer about those knocks
i told them everything just as it was ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov wondered inwardly again if i thought of anything then he began again it was solely of some wickedness on your part
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov might kill him but that he would steal i did not believe that then but i was prepared for any wickedness from you
you told me yourself you could sham a fit what did you say that for it was just through my simplicity and i never have shammed a fit on purpose in my life
and i only said so then to boast to you it was just foolishness i liked you so much then and was open hearted with you
my brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft what else is left for him to do said smerdyakov with a bitter grin
and who will believe him with all the proofs against him grigory_vassilyevitch saw the door open what can he say after that
but never mind him he is trembling to save himself he slowly ceased speaking then suddenly as though on reflection added and look here again
he wants to throw it on me and make out that it is the work of my hands i ve heard that already
but as to my being clever at shamming a fit should i have told you beforehand that i could sham one if i really had had such a design against your father_zossima
if i had been planning such a murder could i have been such a fool as to give such evidence against myself beforehand
and to his son too upon my word is that likely as if that could be such a thing has never happened
no one hears this talk of ours now except providence itself and if you were to tell of it to the prosecutor and nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov you might defend me completely by doing so for who would be likely to be such a criminal if he is so open hearted beforehand
any one can see that well and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov got up to cut short the conversation struck by smerdyakov last argument
i dont suspect you at all and i think it absurd indeed to suspect you on the contrary i am grateful to you for setting my mind at rest
now i am going but i ll come again meanwhile good by get well is there anything you want i am very thankful for everything
marfa_ignatyevna does not forget me and provides me anything i want according to her kindness good people visit me every day
but i shant say anything of your being able to sham a fit and i dont advise you to either something made ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov say suddenly
good by i quite understand and if you dont speak of that i shall say nothing of that conversation of ours at the gate
then it happened that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went out and only when he had gone a dozen steps along the corridor he suddenly felt that there was an insulting significance in smerdyakov last words
he was almost on the point of turning back but it was only a passing impulse and muttering nonsense
his chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not smerdyakov but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov who had committed the murder though he might have been expected to feel the opposite
he did not want to analyze the reason for this feeling and even felt a positive repugnance at prying into his sensations
in the following day he became convinced of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov guilt as he got to know all the weight of evidence against him
there was evidence of people of no importance fenya and her mother for instance but the effect of it was almost overpowering
as to pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin the people at the tavern and at plotnikov shop as well as the witnesses at mokroe their evidence seemed conclusive
he went out of the hospital he felt as though he wanted to make haste to forget something it was the details that were so damning
grigory_vassilyevitch wife marfa in answer to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov questions declared that smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall
he was not three paces from our bed and that although she was a sound sleeper she waked several time and heard him moaning
the secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as grigory_vassilyevitch evidence as to the open door he was moaning the whole time moaning continually
talking to herzenstube and giving it as his opinion that smerdyakov was not mad but only rather weak ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov only evoked from the old man a subtle smile
do you know how he spends his time now he asked learning lists of french words by heart
he has an exercise book under his pillow with the french words written out in russian letters for him by some one he he he
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov ended by dismissing all doubts he could not think of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov without repulsion only one thing was strange however alyosha_karamazov persisted that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was not the murderer and that in all probability smerdyakov was
another thing that was strange was that alyosha_karamazov did not make any attempt to talk about mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov always felt that alyosha_karamazov opinion meant a great deal to him and so he was astonished at it now this too struck ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov particularly
but he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that on his return from moscow he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for katerina_ivanovna
this is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov which left its mark on all the rest of his life this would furnish the subject for another novel which i may perhaps never write
but i cannot omit to mention here that when ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov on leaving katerina_ivanovna with alyosha_karamazov as i ve related already told him i am not keen on her it was an absolute lie he loved her madly though at time he hated her so that he might have murdered her
many causes helped to bring about this feeling shattered by what had happened with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov she rushed on ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov return to meet him as her one salvation
she was hurt insulted and humiliated in her feeling and here the man had come back to her who had loved her so ardently before oh
but the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to the man she loved in spite of the alyosha_karamazov violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her
she was continually tormented at the same time by remorse for having deserted mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and in moments of discord and violent anger and they were numerous
she knew that very well and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own she told ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov so plainly
this was what he had called to alyosha_karamazov lies upon lies there was of course much that was false in it and that angered ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov more than anything
he did in fact for a time almost forget smerdyakov existence and yet a fortnight after his first visit to him he began to be haunted by the same strange thoughts as before
it enough to say that he was continually asking himself why was it that on that last night in fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov house he had crept out on to the stairs like a thief and listened to hear what his father_zossima was doing below
but of all this later why had he recalled that afterwards with repulsion why next morning had he been suddenly so depressed on the journey
and now he almost fancied that these tormenting thoughts would make him even forget katerina_ivanovna so completely did they take possession of him again
why as he reached moscow had he said to himself i am a scoundrel it was just after fancying this that he met alyosha_karamazov in the street
he stopped him at once and put a question to him do you remember when dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov burst in after dinner and beat father_zossima and afterwards i told you in the yard that i reserved the right to desire
tell me did you think then that i desired father_zossima death or not i did think so answered alyosha_karamazov softly
it was so too it was not a matter of guessing but didnt you fancy then that what i wished was just that one reptile should devour another
that is just that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov should kill father_zossima and as soon as possible and that i myself was even prepared to help to bring that about
alyosha_karamazov turned rather pale and looked silently into his brother face speak cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov i want above everything to know what you thought then
i want the truth the truth he drew a deep breath looking angrily at alyosha_karamazov before his answer came forgive me i did think that too at the time whispered alyosha_karamazov and he did not add one softening phrase
from that time alyosha_karamazov noticed that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov began obviously to avoid him and seemed even to have taken a dislike to him so much so that alyosha_karamazov gave up going to see him
thanks snapped ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and leaving alyosha_karamazov he went quickly on his way immediately after that meeting with him ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had not gone home but went straight to smerdyakov again
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knew his new lodging the dilapidated little wooden house divided in two by a passage on one side of which lived marya_kondratyevna and her mother and on the other smerdyakov
chapter vii the second visit to smerdyakov by that time smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital no one knew on what terms he lived with them whether as a friend or as a lodger
it was supposed afterwards that he had come to stay with them as marya_kondratyevna betrothed and was living there for a time without paying for board or lodging
both mother and daughter had the greatest respect for him and looked upon him as greatly superior to themselves ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knocked and on the door being opened went straight into the passage
by marya_kondratyevna directions he went straight to the better room on the left occupied by smerdyakov there was a tiled stove in the room and it was extremely hot
the walls were gay with blue paper which was a good deal used however and in the cracks under it cockroaches swarmed in amazing numbers so that there was a continual rustling from them
the furniture was very scanty two benches against each wall and two chairs by the table the table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with pink patterns on it
there was a pot of geranium on each of the two little windows in the corner there was a case of ikons
on the table stood a little copper samovar with many dents in it and a tray with two cups but smerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out
he was sitting at the table on a bench he was looking at an exercise book and slowly writing with a pen
there was a bottle of ink by him and a flat iron candlestick but with a composite candle ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov saw at once from smerdyakov face that he had completely recovered from his illness
his face was fresher fuller his hair stood up jauntily in front and was plastered down at the sides he was sitting in a parti colored wadded dressing gown rather dirty and frayed however
he had spectacles on his nose which ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had never seen him wearing before this trifling circumstance suddenly redoubled ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov anger
smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked intently at his visitor through his spectacles then he slowly took them off and rose from the bench but by no means respectfully almost lazily doing the least possible required by common civility
all this struck ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov instantly he took it all in and noted it at once most of all the look in smerdyakov eye positively malicious churlish and haughty
a creature like that and wearing spectacles what do you want to intrude for it seemed to say we settled everything then why have you come again
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov could scarcely control himself it hot here he said still standing and unbuttoned his overcoat take off your coat smerdyakov conceded
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov took off his coat and threw it on a bench with trembling hands he took a chair moved it quickly to the table and sat down
smerdyakov managed to sit down on his bench before him to begin with are we alone ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov asked sternly and impulsively
listen my good fellow what was that you babbled as i was leaving the hospital that if i said nothing about your faculty of shamming fits you wouldnt tell the investigating lawyer all our conversation at the gate
can they overhear us in there no one can hear anything you ve seen for yourself there a passage what do you mean by all
what could you mean by it were you threatening me have i entered into some sort of compact with you do you suppose i am afraid of you
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said this in a perfect fury giving him to understand with obvious intention that he scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and meant to show his cards
smerdyakov eye gleamed resentfully his left eye winked and he at once gave his answer with his habitual composure and deliberation
this is what i meant then and this is why i said that that you knowing beforehand of this murder of your own parent left him to his fate and that people mightnt after that conclude any evil about your feeling and perhaps of something else too that what i promised not to tell the authorities
though smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling himself yet there was something in his voice determined and emphatic resentful and insolently defiant
you want to have everything above board very well you shall have it he seemed to say he stared impudently at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
a mist passed before ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov eye for the first moment how what are you out of your mind i perfectly in possession of all my faculties
do you suppose i knew of the murder ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried at last and he brought his fist violently on the table
what do you mean by something else too speak scoundrel smerdyakov was silent and still scanned ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with the same insolent stare
speak you stinking rogue what is that something else too the something else i meant was that you probably too were very desirous of your parent death
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov jumped up and struck him with all his might on the shoulder so that he fell back against the wall
saying it a shame sir to strike a sick man he dried his eye with a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping
in an instant his face was bathed in tears a minute passed that enough leave off ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said peremptorily sitting down again
dont put me out of all patience smerdyakov took the rag from his eye every line of his puckered face reflected the insult he had just received
i didnt know what thoughts were in your mind then said smerdyakov resentfully and so i stopped you then at the gate to sound you on that very point
so you thought then you scoundrel that together with dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov i meant to kill my father_zossima to sound what what
why that very circumstance whether you wanted your father_zossima to be murdered or not what infuriated ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov more than anything was the aggressive insolent tone to which smerdyakov persistently adhered
it was you murdered him he cried suddenly smerdyakov smiled contemptuously you know of yourself for a fact that it wasn t
i murdered him and i should have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of it again
but why why had you such a suspicion about me at the time as you know already it was simply from fear
i resolved to sound you too for i thought if you wanted the same as your brother then the business was as good as settled and i should be crushed like a fly too
for i was in such a position shaking with fear that i suspected every one look here you didnt say that a fortnight ago
i meant the same when i talked to you in the hospital only i thought you understand without wasting words and that being such a sensible man you wouldnt care to talk of it openly
come answer answer i insist what was it what could i have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul
as for the murder you couldnt have done that and didnt want to but as for wanting some one else to do it that was just what you did want
what next and how coolly how coolly he speaks but why should i have wanted it what grounds had i for wanting it
why after your parent death there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you and very likely more but
if fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov got married then to that lady agrafena_alexandrovna she would have had all his capital made over to her directly after the wedding for she plenty of sense so that your parent would not have left you two roubles between the three of you
what grounds had you what about the inheritance said smerdyakov sarcastically and as it were vindictively and were they far from a wedding either
not a hair breadth that lady had only to lift her little finger and he would have run after her to church_of_christ with his tongue out
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov restrained himself with painful effort very good he commented at last you see i havent jumped up i havent knocked you down i havent killed you
speak on so according to you i had fixed on dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov to do it i was reckoning on him how could you help reckoning on him
if he killed him then he would lose all the rights of a nobleman his rank and property and would go off to exile so his share of the inheritance would come to you and your brother alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in equal parts so you each have not forty but sixty thousand each
listen scoundrel if i had reckoned on any one then it would have been on you not on dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and i swear i did expect some wickedness from you at the time
there not a doubt you did reckon on dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov what i put up with from you i remember my impression
i thought too for a minute at the time that you were reckoning on me as well said smerdyakov with a sarcastic grin
for if you had a foreboding about me and yet went away you as good as said to me you can murder my parent i wont hinder you
so that it was just by that more than anything you showed me what was in your mind you scoundrel
you were meaning to go to moscow and refused all your father_zossima entreaty to go to tchermashnya and simply at a foolish word from me you consented at once
so that how you understood it it was all that going to tchermashnya why what reason had you to consent to tchermashnya
since you went to tchermashnya with no reason simply at my word it shows that you must have expected something from me
then you ought as your father_zossima son to have had me taken to the lock up and thrashed at once for my words then or at least to have given me a punch in the face on the spot but you were not a bit angry if you please and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolish word and went away which was utterly absurd for you ought to have stayed to save your parent life
no i swear i didnt shouted ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov grinding his teeth you didnt how could i help drawing my conclusions
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov sat scowling both his fists convulsively pressed on his knees yes i am sorry i didnt punch you in the face he said with a bitter smile
i couldnt have taken you to the lock up just then who would have believed me and what charge could i bring against you
but the punch in the face oh i sorry i didnt think of it though blows are forbidden i should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly
in the ordinary occasions of life he said in the same complacent and sententious tone in which he had taunted grigory_vassilyevitch and argued with him about religion at fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov table in the ordinary occasions of life blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law and people have given them up but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows not only among us but all over the world be it even the fullest republic of france just as in the time of adam and eve and they never will leave off but you even in an exceptional case did not dare
smerdyakov looked at him almost with relish what are you learning french words for ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nodded towards the exercise book lying on the table
why shouldnt i learn them so as to improve my education supposing that i may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of europe
i am not afraid of your accusations you can say what you like about me and if i dont beat you to death it simply because i suspect you of that crime
listen monster ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov eye flashed and he trembled all over and i ll drag you to justice i ll unmask you
to my thinking you better keep quiet for what can you accuse me of considering my absolute innocence and who would believe you
only if you begin i shall tell everything too for i must defend myself do you think i am afraid of you now
if the court doesnt believe all i ve said to you just now the public will and you will be ashamed
that as much as to say it always worth while speaking to a sensible man eh snarled ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov got up shaking all over with indignation put on his coat and without replying further to smerdyakov without even looking at him walked quickly out of the cottage
you hit the mark indeed and you better be sensible the cool evening air refreshed him there was a bright moon in the sky
a nightmare of ideas and sensations filled his soul shall i go at once and give information against smerdyakov but what information can i give
he is not guilty anyway on the contrary he ll accuse me and in fact why did i set off for tchermashnya then
what for what for ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov asked himself yes of course i was expecting something and he is right
and he remembered for the hundredth time how on the last night in his father_zossima house he had listened on the stairs
but he remembered it now with such anguish that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed
yes i expected it then that true i wanted the murder i did want the murder did i want the murder
did i want it i must kill smerdyakov if i dont dare kill smerdyakov now life is not worth living ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov did not go home but went straight to katerina_ivanovna and alarmed her by his appearance
he was like a madman he repeated all his conversation with smerdyakov every syllable of it he couldnt be calmed however much she tried to soothe him he kept walking about the room speaking strangely disconnectedly
at last he sat down put his elbows on the table leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this strange sentence if it not dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov but smerdyakov who the murderer i share his guilt for i put him up to it
whether i did i dont know yet but if he is the murderer and not dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov then of course i am the murderer too
when katerina_ivanovna heard that she got up from her seat without a word went to her writing table opened a box standing on it took out a sheet of paper and laid it before ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
this was the document of which ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov spoke to alyosha_karamazov later on as a conclusive proof that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov had killed his father_zossima
it was the letter written by mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to katerina_ivanovna when he was drunk on the very evening he met alyosha_karamazov at the crossroads on the way to the monastery after the scene at katerina_ivanovna when grushenka had insulted her
i dont know whether he saw her but in the evening he was at the metropolis where he got thoroughly drunk
then parting from alyosha_karamazov mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had rushed to grushenka then he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself
it was like the talk of a drunken man who on his return home begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has just been insulted what a rascal had just insulted him what a fine fellow he is on the other hand and how he will pay that scoundrel out and all that at great length with great excitement and incoherence with drunken tears and blows on the table
it was a wordy disconnected frantic letter a drunken letter in fact the letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind
there was evidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov not only filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest
it had been provided by the tavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it the letter ran as follows
to morrow i will get the money and repay your three thousand and farewell woman of great wrath but farewell too my love
to morrow i shall try and get it from every one and if i cant borrow it i give you my word of honor
i shall go to my father_zossima and break his skull and take the money from under the pillow if only ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has gone
fatal katya let us make an end if i have to go to siberia for it i ll give you back your three thousand
and farewell i bow down to the ground before you for i ve been a scoundrel to you forgive me no better not forgive me you ll be happier and so shall i_
better siberia than your love for i love another woman and you got to know her too well to day so how can you forgive
i will murder the man who robbed me i ll leave you all and go to the east so as to see no one again
not her either for you are not my only tormentress she is too farewell s i write my curse but i adore you
i hear it in my heart one string is left and it vibrates better tear my heart in two i shall kill myself but first of all that cur
i shall tear three thousand from him and fling it to you though i ve been a scoundrel to you i am not a thief
you can expect three thousand the cur keeps it under his mattress in pink ribbon i am not a thief but i ll murder my thief
katya dont look disdainful dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov is not a thief but a murderer he has murdered his father_zossima and ruined himself to hold his ground rather than endure your pride
and he doesnt love you p i kiss your feet farewell p s katya pray to god that some one ll give me the money
then i shall not be steeped in gore and if no one does i shall kill me your slave and enemy alyosha_karamazov
when ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov read this document he was convinced so then it was his brother not smerdyakov and if not smerdyakov then not he ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
this letter at once assumed in his eye the aspect of a logical proof there could be no longer the slightest doubt of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov guilt
the suspicion never occurred to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov by the way that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov might have committed the murder in conjunction with smerdyakov and indeed such a theory did not fit in with the facts
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was completely reassured the next morning he only thought of smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt a few day later he positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed at his suspicions
he made no further inquiry about smerdyakov but twice he happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind
he resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him so passed a month he ll end in madness the young doctor varvinsky observed about him and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov remembered this
during the last week of that month ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov himself began to feel very ill he went to consult the moscow doctor who had been sent for by katerina_ivanovna just before the trial
and just at that time his relations with katerina_ivanovna became acutely strained they were like two enemies in love with one another
katerina_ivanovna returns to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that is her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his favor drove ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to perfect frenzy
strange to say until that last scene described above when alyosha_karamazov came from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to katerina_ivanovna ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had never once during that month heard her express a doubt of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov guilt in spite of those returns that were so hateful to him
it is remarkable too that while he felt that he hated mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov more and more every day he realized that it was not on account of katya returns that he hated him but just because he was the murderer of his father_zossima
nevertheless he went to see mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ten day before the trial and proposed to him a plan of escape a plan he had obviously thought over a long time
he was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart from a phrase of smerdyakov that it was to his
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov advantage that his brother should be convicted as that would increase his inheritance and alyosha_karamazov from forty to sixty thousand roubles
he was conscious of this and fully recognized it to himself he determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov escape
on his return from seeing him he was very mournful and dispirited he suddenly began to feel that he was anxious for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov escape not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing thirty thousand but for another reason
is it because i am as much a murderer at heart he asked himself something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul
but of that later when after his conversation with alyosha_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly decided with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to smerdyakov he obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation
he suddenly remembered how katerina_ivanovna had only just cried out to him in alyosha_karamazov presence it was you you persuaded me of his that is mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov guilt
he had never once tried to persuade her that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was the murderer on the contrary he had suspected himself in her presence that time when he came back from smerdyakov
his pride above all suffered cruelly all that month ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was thunderstruck when he recalled it it was she she who had produced that document and proved his brother guilt
and now she suddenly exclaimed i ve been at smerdyakov myself when had she been there ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had known nothing of it
so she was not at all so sure of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov guilt and what could smerdyakov have told her what what had he said to her
he could not understand how he could half an hour before have let those words pass and not have cried out at the moment
his heart burned with violent anger he let go of the bell and rushed off to smerdyakov i shall kill him perhaps this time he thought on the way
when he was half way there the keen dry wind that had been blowing early that morning rose again and a fine dry snow began falling thickly
it did not lie on the ground but was whirled about by the wind and soon there was a regular snowstorm
chapter viii the third and last interview with smerdyakov there were scarcely any lamp posts in the part of the town where smerdyakov lived
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov strode alone in the darkness unconscious of the storm instinctively picking out his way his head ached and there was a painful throbbing in his temples
he felt that his hands were twitching convulsively not far from marya_kondratyevna cottage ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly came upon a solitary drunken little peasant
he was wearing a coarse and patched coat and was walking in zigzags grumbling and swearing to himself then suddenly he would begin singing in a husky drunken voice
but he broke off every time at the second line and began swearing again then he would begin the same song again
ach vanka gone to petersburg i wont wait till he comes back ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov felt an intense hatred for him before he had thought about him at all
at that moment they met and the peasant with a violent lurch fell full tilt against ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov who pushed him back furiously
suddenly he realized his presence and felt an irresistible impulse to knock him down the peasant went flying backwards and fell like a log on the frozen ground
he uttered one plaintive oh and then was silent ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stepped up to him he was lying on his back without movement or consciousness
in the passage marya_kondratyevna who ran out to open the door with a candle in her hand whispered that smerdyakov was very ill it not that he laid up but he seems not himself and he even told us to take the tea away he wouldnt have any
he will be frozen thought ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and he went on his way to smerdyakov why does he make a row asked ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov coarsely
oh dear no quite the contrary he very quiet only please dont talk to him too long marya_kondratyevna begged him
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov opened the door and stepped into the room it was over heated as before but there were changes in the room
one of the benches at the side had been removed and in its place had been put a large old mahogany leather sofa on which a bed had been made up with fairly clean white pillows
smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa wearing the same dressing gown the table had been brought out in front of the sofa so that there was hardly room to move
on the table lay a thick book in yellow cover but smerdyakov was not reading it he seemed to be sitting doing nothing
he met ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a slow silent gaze and was apparently not at all surprised at his coming there was a great change in his face he was much thinner and sallower
his eye were sunken and there were blue marks under them why you really are ill ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stopped short
i wont keep you long i wont even take off my coat where can one sit down he went to the other end of the table moved up a chair and sat down on it
why do you look at me without speaking i ve only come with one question and i swear i wont go without an answer
has the young lady katerina_ivanovna been with you smerdyakov still remained silent looking quietly at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov as before suddenly with a motion of his hand he turned his face away
what the matter with you cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nothing what do you mean by nothing yes she has
it no matter to you let me alone no i wont let you alone tell me when was she here
why i quite forgotten about her said smerdyakov with a scornful smile and turning his face to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov again he stared at him with a look of frenzied hatred
the same look that he had fixed on him at their last interview a month before you seem very ill yourself your face is sunken you dont look like yourself he said to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
never mind my health tell me what i ask you but why are your eye so yellow the whites are quite yellow
are you so worried he smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright listen i ve told you i wont go away without an answer
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried intensely irritated why do you keep pestering me why do you torment me said smerdyakov with a look of suffering
damn it i ve nothing to do with you just answer my question and i ll go away i ve no answer to give you said smerdyakov looking down again
you may be sure i ll make you answer why are you so uneasy smerdyakov stared at him not simply with contempt but almost with repulsion
is this because the trial begins to morrow nothing will happen to you cant you believe that at last go home go to bed and sleep in peace dont be afraid of anything
i dont understand you what have i to be afraid of to morrow ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov articulated in astonishment and suddenly a chill breath of fear did in fact pass over his soul
smerdyakov measured him with his eye you dont understand he drawled reproachfully it a strange thing a sensible man should care to play such a farce
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov looked at him speechless the startling incredibly supercilious tone of this man who had once been his valet was extraordinary in itself
he had not taken such a tone even at their last interview i tell you you ve nothing to be afraid of
i wont say anything about you there no proof against you i say how your hands are trembling why are your fingers moving like that
go home you did not murder him ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov started he remembered alyosha_karamazov i know it was not i he faltered
do you smerdyakov caught him up again ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov jumped up and seized him by the shoulder tell me everything you viper
tell me everything smerdyakov was not in the least scared he only riveted his eye on ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with insane hatred
well it was you who murdered him if that it he whispered furiously ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov sank back on his chair as though pondering something
he laughed malignantly you mean my going away what you talked about last time you stood before me last time and understood it all and you understand it now
all i understand is that you are mad arent you tired of it here we are face to face what the use of going on keeping up a farce to each other
you murdered him you are the real murderer i was only your instrument your faithful servant and it was following your words i did it
are you still trying to throw it all on me to my face did it why did you murder him
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov turned cold something seemed to give way in his brain and he shuddered all over with a cold shiver then smerdyakov himself looked at him wonderingly probably the genuineness of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov horror struck him
you dont mean to say you really did not know he faltered mistrustfully looking with a forced smile into his eye
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov still gazed at him and seemed unable to speak ach vanka gone to petersburg i wont wait till he comes back suddenly echoed in his head
do you know i am afraid that you are a dream a phantom sitting before me he muttered there no phantom here but only us two and one other
no doubt he is here that third between us who is he who is here what third person ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried in alarm looking about him his eye hastily searching in every corner
that third is god himself providence he is the third beside us now only dont look for him you wont find him
it a lie that you killed him ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried madly you are mad or teasing me again smerdyakov as before watched him curiously with no sign of fear
he could still scarcely get over his incredulity he still fancied that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov knew everything and was trying to throw it all on him to his face
wait a minute he said at last in a weak voice and suddenly bringing up his left leg from under the table he began turning up his trouser leg
he was wearing long white stockings and slippers slowly he took off his garter and fumbled to the bottom of his stocking
he cried and rapidly jumping up he drew back so that he knocked his back against the wall and stood up against it stiff and straight
he looked with insane terror at smerdyakov who entirely unaffected by his terror continued fumbling in his stocking as though he were making an effort to get hold of something with his fingers and pull it out
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov gazed at him and suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm of terror he mad at last he got hold of it and began pulling it out
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov saw that it was a piece of paper or perhaps a roll of papers smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it on the table
here he said quietly what is it asked ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov trembling kindly look at it smerdyakov answered still in the same low tone
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stepped up to the table took up the roll of paper and began unfolding it but suddenly he drew back his fingers as though from contact with a loathsome reptile
your hands keep twitching observed smerdyakov and he deliberately unfolded the bundle himself under the wrapper were three packets of hundred rouble notes
they are all here all the three thousand roubles you need not count them take them smerdyakov suggested to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nodding at the notes
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov sank back in his chair he was as white as a handkerchief you frightened me with your stocking he said with a strange grin
can you really not have known till now smerdyakov asked once more no i did not know i kept thinking of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
brother brother ach he suddenly clutched his head in both hands listen did you kill him alone with my brother help or without
it was only with you with your help i killed him and dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is quite innocent all right all right
talk about me later why do i keep on trembling i cant speak properly you were bold enough then you said everything was lawful and how frightened you are now smerdyakov muttered in surprise
wont you have some lemonade i ll ask for some at once it very refreshing only i must hide this first
he was just going to get up and call at the door to marya_kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring it them but looking for something to cover up the notes that she might not see them he first took out his handkerchief and as it turned out to be very dirty took up the big yellow book that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had noticed at first lying on the table and put it over the notes
and again he motioned at the notes the book was the sayings of the holy father_zossima isaac the syrian
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov read it mechanically i wont have any lemonade he said talk of me later sit down and tell me how you did it
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov as though he only just thought of it took off his coat and without getting up from his chair threw it on the bench
tell me all about it you better take off your greatcoat or you ll be too hot speak please speak
he seemed calmer he waited feeling sure that smerdyakov would tell him all about it how it was done sighed smerdyakov
of my words later ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov broke in again apparently with complete self possession firmly uttering his words and not shouting as before
it was done in a most natural way following your very words only tell me in detail how you did it
everything as it happened dont forget anything the details above everything the details i beg you you gone away then i fell into the cellar
i went quietly down the steps to the very bottom and lay down quietly and as i lay down i gave a scream and struggled till they carried me out
in a fit or in a sham one a sham one naturally i shammed it all stay and were you shamming all along afterwards and in the hospital
next day in the morning before they took me to the hospital i had a real attack and a more violent one than i ve had for years
no not at all for two day i was quite unconscious all right all right go on they laid me on the bed
i knew i be the other side of the partition for whenever i was ill marfa_ignatyevna used to put me there near them
she always been very kind to me from my birth up at night i moaned but quietly i kept expecting dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to come
i expected him to come into the house for i no doubt that he come that night for being without me and getting no news he be sure to come and climb over the fence as he used to and do something
expecting him to come to you not to me and if he hadnt come then nothing would have happened
i should never have brought myself to it without him all right all right speak more intelligibly dont hurry above all dont leave anything out
i expected him to kill fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov i thought that was certain for i had prepared him for it during the last few day
with his suspiciousness and the fury which had been growing in him all those day he was bound to get into the house by means of those taps
stay ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov interrupted if he had killed him he would have taken the money and carried it away you must have considered that
he knew about the knocks that was the chief thing that was inevitable so i was expecting him what would you have got by it afterwards
i dont see but he would never have found the money that was only what i told him that the money was under the mattress
and afterwards i suggested to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov as i was the only person he trusted to hide the envelope with the notes in the corner behind the ikons for no one would have guessed that place especially if they came in a hurry
but that wasnt true it had been lying in a box so that where the envelope lay in the corner behind the ikons
it would have been absurd to keep it under the mattress the box anyway could be locked but all believe it was under the mattress
so if dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had committed the murder finding nothing he would either have run away in a hurry afraid of every sound as always happens with murderers or he would have been arrested
so i could always have clambered up to the ikons and have taken away the money next morning or even that night and it would have all been put down to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
a stupid thing to believe i could reckon upon that but what if he did not kill him but only knocked him down
if he did not kill him of course i would not have ventured to take the money and nothing would have happened
but i calculated that he would beat him senseless and i should have time to take it then and then i make out to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov that it was no one
but dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov who had taken the money after beating him stop i am getting mixed then it was dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov after all who killed him you only took the money
no he didnt kill him well i might as well have told you now that he was the murderer but i dont want to lie to you now
because because if you really havent understood till now as i see for myself and are not pretending so as to throw your guilt on me to my very face you are still responsible for it all since you knew of the murder and charged me to do it and went away knowing all about it
and so i want to prove to your face this evening that you are the only real murderer in the whole affair and i am not the real murderer though i did kill him
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried unable to restrain himself at last and forgetting that he had put off discussing himself till the end of the conversation
you are the rightful murderer why why am i a murderer oh god you still mean that tchermashnya stay tell me why did you want my consent if you really took tchermashnya for consent
assured of your consent i should have known that you wouldnt have made an outcry over those three thousand being lost even if i been suspected instead of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov or as his accomplice on the contrary you would have protected me from others
and when you got your inheritance you would have rewarded me when you were able all the rest of your life
for you have received your inheritance through me seeing that if he had married agrafena_alexandrovna you wouldnt have had a farthing
how will you explain that now ah then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards snarled ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and what if i hadnt gone away then but had informed against you
what could you have informed that i persuaded you to go to tchermashnya that all nonsense besides after our conversation you would either have gone away or have stayed
if you had stayed nothing would have happened i should have known that you didnt want it done and should have attempted nothing
as you went away it meant you assured me that you wouldnt dare to inform against me at the trial and that you overlook my having the three thousand
because then i should have told it all in the court that is not that i had stolen the money or killed him i shouldnt have said that but that you put me up to the theft and the murder though i didnt consent to it
that why i needed your consent so that you couldnt have cornered me afterwards for what proof could you have had
i could always have cornered you revealing your eagerness for your father_zossima death and i tell you the public would have believed it all and you would have been ashamed for the rest of your life
and indeed you couldnt have prosecuted me afterwards was i then so eager was i ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov snarled again to be sure you were and by your consent you silently sanctioned my doing it
smerdyakov looked resolutely at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he was very weak and spoke slowly and wearily but some hidden inner force urged him on
he evidently had some design ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov felt that go on he said tell me what happened that night what more is there to tell
and before that grigory_vassilyevitch had suddenly got up and came out and he suddenly gave a scream and then all was silence and darkness
i lay there and i thought i heard the master shout i lay there waiting my heart beating i couldnt bear it
i saw the window open on the left into the garden and i stepped to the left to listen whether he was sitting there alive and i heard the master moving about sighing so
i got up at last went out i knew he was alive ech i thought i went to the window and shouted to the master it i_
and he shouted to me he been he been he run away he meant dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had been he killed grigory_vassilyevitch
where i whispered there in the corner he pointed he was whispering too wait a bit i said
i went to the corner of the garden to look and there i came upon grigory_vassilyevitch lying by the wall covered with blood senseless
so it true that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has been here was the thought that came into my head and i determined on the spot to make an end of it as grigory_vassilyevitch even if he were alive would see nothing of it as he lay there senseless
i felt that at the moment but the longing to get it done came over me till i could scarcely breathe
i went back to the window to the master and said she here she come agrafena_alexandrovna has come wants to be let in
the only risk was that marfa_ignatyevna might wake up and he started like a baby where is she he fairly gasped but couldnt believe it
she standing there said i open he looked out of the window at me half believing and half distrustful but afraid to open
i bethought me to knock on the window frame those taps we agreed upon as a signal that grushenka had come in his presence before his eye
he didnt seem to believe my word but as soon as he heard the taps he ran at once to open the door
why he is afraid of me now i thought and it was funny he opened it i would have gone in but he stood in the way to prevent me passing
where is she where is she he looked at me all of a tremble well thought i if he so frightened of me as all that it a bad look out
and my legs went weak with fright that he wouldnt let me in or would call out or marfa_ignatyevna would run up or something else might happen
i dont remember now but i must have stood pale facing him i whispered to him why she there there under the window how is it you dont see her
she afraid said i she was frightened at the noise she hidden in the bushes go and call to her yourself from the study
i said bring her then bring her he ran to the window put the candle in the window
though he cried that he didnt want to lean out of the window he didnt want to move away from me for he was panic stricken he was so frightened he didnt dare to turn his back on me
grushenka he cried grushenka are you here why here she is said i i went up to the window and leaned right out of it
he suddenly believed it he was all of a shake he was awfully crazy about her and he leaned right out of the window
here she is she in the bush laughing at you dont you see her i snatched up that iron paper weight from his table do you remember weighing about three pounds
i swung it and hit him on the top of the skull with the corner of it he didnt even cry out
he only sank down suddenly and i hit him again and a third time and the third time i knew i broken his skull
he suddenly rolled on his back face upwards covered with blood i looked round there was no blood on me not a spot
i wiped the paper weight put it back went up to the ikons took the money out of the envelope and flung the envelope on the floor and the pink ribbon beside it
i went out into the garden all of a tremble straight to the apple tree with a hollow in it you know that hollow
i marked it long before and put a rag and a piece of paper ready in it i wrapped all the notes in the rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole
i went back to my bed lay down and thought if grigory_vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me but if he is not killed and recovers it will be first rate for then he ll bear witness that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has been here and so he must have killed him and taken the money
and there it stayed for over a fortnight i took it out later when i came out of the hospital then i began groaning with suspense and impatience so as to wake marfa_ignatyevna as soon as possible
at last she got up and she rushed to me but when she saw grigory_vassilyevitch was not there she ran out and i heard her scream in the garden
and that set it all going and set my mind at rest he stopped ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had listened all the time in dead silence without stirring or taking his eye off him
as he told his story smerdyakov glanced at him from time to time but for the most part kept his eye averted
when he had finished he was evidently agitated and was breathing hard the perspiration stood out on his face but it was impossible to tell whether it was remorse he was feeling or what
stay cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov pondering what about the door if he only opened the door to you how could grigory_vassilyevitch have seen it open before
it was remarkable that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov spoke quite amicably in a different tone not angry as before so if any one had opened the door at that moment and peeped in at them he would certainly have concluded that they were talking peaceably about some ordinary though interesting subject
as for that door and grigory_vassilyevitch having seen it open that only his fancy said smerdyakov with a wry smile
for grigory_vassilyevitch saw it before you went he is not a man i assure you but an obstinate mule
it just our luck he took that notion into his head for they cant fail to convict dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov after that
he didnt see it but fancied he had seen it and there no shaking him listen said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov beginning to seem bewildered again and making an effort to grasp something
listen there are a lot of questions i want to ask you but i forget them i keep forgetting and getting mixed up
yes tell me this at least why did you open the envelope and leave it there on the floor why didnt you simply carry off the envelope
when you were telling me i thought you spoke about it as though it were the right thing to do
for if a man had known all about it as i did for instance if he seen those notes before and perhaps had put them in that envelope himself and had seen the envelope sealed up and addressed with his own eye if such a man had done the murder what should have made him tear open the envelope afterwards especially in such desperate haste since he know for certain the notes must be in the envelope
no if the robber had been some one like me he simply have put the envelope straight in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he could
he only knew about the envelope by hearsay he had never seen it and if he found it for instance under the mattress he have torn it open as quickly as possible to make sure the notes were in it
but why i cant understand i did that for a good reason but it be quite different with dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and he have thrown the envelope down without having time to think that it would be evidence against him
because he was not an habitual thief and had never directly stolen anything before for he is a gentleman born and if he did bring himself to steal it would not be regular stealing but simply taking what was his own for he told the whole town he meant to before and had even bragged aloud before every one that he go and take his property from fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
i didnt say that openly to the prosecutor when i was being examined but quite the contrary i brought him to it by a hint as though i didnt see it myself and as though he thought of it himself
and i hadnt prompted him so that mr prosecutor mouth positively watered at my suggestion but can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot
cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov overcome with astonishment he looked at smerdyakov again with alarm mercy on us could any one think of it all in such a desperate hurry
it was all thought out beforehand well well it was the devil helped you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried again no you are not a fool you are far cleverer than i thought
but as the table blocked his way and there was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall he only turned round where he stood and sat down again
he got up obviously intending to walk across the room he was in terrible distress perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him as he suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before
dont you understand that if i havent killed you it simply because i am keeping you to answer to morrow at the trial
god sees ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov raised his hand perhaps i too was guilty perhaps i really had a secret desire for my father_zossima death but i swear i was not as guilty as you think and perhaps i didnt urge you on at all
listen you miserable contemptible creature no no i didnt urge you on but no matter i will give evidence against myself to morrow at the trial
and whatever you may say against me at the trial whatever evidence you give i ll face it i am not afraid of you
i determined to i shall tell everything everything but we ll make our appearance together i ll confirm it all myself but you must confess too
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eye alone it could be seen that it would be so
you must you must we ll go together that how it shall be you are ill i see you are quite ill
your eye are yellow smerdyakov commented without the least irony with apparent sympathy in fact we ll go together ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov repeated
and if you wont go no matter i ll go alone smerdyakov paused as though pondering there ll be nothing of the sort and you wont go he concluded at last positively
and what more it will be no use at all for i shall say straight out that i never said anything of the sort to you and that you are either ill and it looks like it too or that you re so sorry for your brother that you are sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it all against me for you ve always thought no more of me than if i been a fly
you dont understand me ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov exclaimed reproachfully you ll be too much ashamed if you confess it all and who will believe you and what single proof have you got
listen you showed me those notes just now to convince me smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side
take that money away with you smerdyakov sighed of course i shall take it but why do you give it to me if you committed the murder for the sake of it
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov looked at him with great surprise i dont want it smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice with a gesture of refusal
i did have an idea of beginning a new life with that money in moscow or better still abroad i did dream of it chiefly because all things are lawful
that was quite right what you taught me for you talked a lot to me about that for if there no everlasting god there no such thing as virtue and there no need of it
you were right there so that how i looked at it did you come to that of yourself asked ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a wry smile
with your guidance and now i suppose you believe in god since you are giving back the money
no i dont believe whispered smerdyakov then why are you giving it back leave off that enough smerdyakov waved his hand again
you used to say yourself that everything was lawful so now why are you so upset too you even want to go and give evidence against yourself
only there ll be nothing of the sort you wont go to give evidence smerdyakov decided with conviction you ll see said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
you like to be respected too for you re very proud you are far too fond of female charms too and you mind most of all about living in undisturbed comfort without having to depend on any one that what you care most about
it isnt possible you are very clever you are fond of money i know that you wont want to spoil your life for ever by taking such a disgrace on yourself
you are like fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov you are more like him than any of his child you ve the same soul as he had
you are not a fool said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov seeming struck the blood rushed to his face you are serious now
he observed looking suddenly at smerdyakov with a different expression it was your pride made you think i was a fool
take the money ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov took the three rolls of notes and put them in his pocket without wrapping them in anything
nobody will believe you as you ve plenty of money of your own you may simply have taken it out of your cash box and brought it to the court
i repeat he said the only reason i havent killed you is that i need you for to morrow remember that dont forget it
i shall show them at the court to morrow he said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov rose from his seat well kill me
kill me now smerdyakov said all at once looking strangely at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov you wont dare do that even he added with a bitter smile
you wont dare to do anything you who used to be so bold till to morrow cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and moved to go out
stay a moment show me those notes again ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov took out the notes and showed them to him smerdyakov looked at them for ten second
well you can go he said with a wave of his hand ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he called after him again
what do you want ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov turned without stopping good by till to morrow ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried again and he walked out of the cottage
the snowstorm was still raging he walked the first few steps boldly but suddenly began staggering it something physical he thought with a grin
he was conscious of unbounded resolution he would make an end of the wavering that had so tortured him of late
something like joy was springing up in his heart his determination was taken and now it will not be changed he thought with relief
at that moment he stumbled against something and almost fell down stopping short he made out at his feet the peasant he had knocked down still lying senseless and motionless
seeing a light in the little house to the right he went up knocked at the shutters and asked the man to whom the house belonged to help him carry the peasant to the police station promising him three roubles
the snow had almost covered his face ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov seized him and lifted him in his arms the man got ready and came out
i wont describe in detail how ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov succeeded in his object bringing the peasant to the police station and arranging for a doctor to see him at once providing with a liberal hand for the expenses
i will only say that this business took a whole hour but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was well content with it his mind wandered and worked incessantly
if i had not taken my decision so firmly for to morrow he reflected with satisfaction i should not have stayed a whole hour to look after the peasant but should have passed by without caring about his being frozen
i am quite capable of watching myself by the way he thought at the same instant with still greater satisfaction although they have decided that i am going out of my mind
just as he reached his own house he stopped short asking himself suddenly hadnt he better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him everything
he decided the question by turning back to the house everything together to morrow he whispered to himself and strange to say almost all his gladness and self satisfaction passed in one instant
as he entered his own room he felt something like a touch of ice on his heart like a recollection or more exactly a reminder of something agonizing and revolting that was in that room now at that moment and had been there before
he sank wearily on his sofa the old woman brought him a samovar he made tea but did not touch it
he sat on the sofa and felt giddy he felt that he was ill and helpless he was beginning to drop asleep but got up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his drowsiness
at moments he fancied he was delirious but it was not illness that he thought of most sitting down again he began looking round as though searching for something
this happened several time at last his eye were fastened intently on one point ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov smiled but an angry flush suffused his face
he sat a long time in his place his head propped on both arms though he looked sideways at the same point at the sofa that stood against the opposite wall
there was evidently something some object that irritated him there worried him and tormented him chapter ix the devil ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov nightmare
but yet i feel that the moment has come when i must inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov illness
anticipating events i can say at least one thing he was at that moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever
though his health had long been affected it had offered a stubborn resistance to the fever which in the end gained complete mastery over it
though i know nothing of medicine i venture to hazard the suggestion that he really had perhaps by a terrible effort of will succeeded in delaying the attack for a time hoping of course to check it completely
he knew that he was unwell but he loathed the thought of being ill at that fatal time at the approaching crisis in his life when he needed to have all his wits about him to say what he had to say boldly and resolutely and to justify himself to himself
he had however consulted the new doctor who had been brought from moscow by a fantastic notion of katerina_ivanovna to which i have referred already
after listening to him and examining him the doctor came to the conclusion that he was actually suffering from some disorder of the brain and was not at all surprised by an admission which ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had reluctantly made him
i am not a doctor hallucinations are quite likely in your condition the doctor opined though it would be better to verify them
you must take steps at once without a moment delay or things will go badly with you but ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov did not follow this judicious advice and did not take to his bed to be nursed
i am walking about so i am strong enough if i drop it ll be different then any one may nurse me who likes he decided dismissing the subject
and so he was sitting almost conscious himself of his delirium and as i have said already looking persistently at some object on the sofa against the opposite wall
some one appeared to be sitting there though goodness knows how he had come in for he had not been in the room when ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov came into it on his return from smerdyakov
this was a person or more accurately speaking a russian gentleman of a particular kind no longer young qui faisait la cinquantaine as the french say with rather long still thick dark hair slightly streaked with gray and a small pointed beard
he was wearing a brownish reefer jacket rather shabby evidently made by a good tailor though and of a fashion at least three years old that had been discarded by smart and well to do people for the last two years
his linen and his long scarf like neck tie were all such as are worn by people who aim at being stylish but on closer inspection his linen was not over clean and his wide scarf was very threadbare
the visitor check trousers were of excellent cut but were too light in color and too tight for the present fashion
his soft fluffy white hat was out of keeping with the season in brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means
it looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle landowners who used to flourish in the time of serfdom
he had unmistakably been at some time in good and fashionable society had once had good connections had possibly preserved them indeed but after a gay youth becoming gradually impoverished on the abolition of serfdom he had sunk into the position of a poor relation of the best class wandering from one good old friend to another and received by them for his companionable and accommodating disposition and as being after all a gentleman who could be asked to sit down with any one though of course not in a place of honor
such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent position who can tell a story take a hand at cards and who have a distinct aversion for any duties that may be forced upon them are usually solitary creatures either bachelors or widowers
sometimes they have child but if so the child are always being brought up at a distance at some aunt to whom these gentlemen never allude in good society seeming ashamed of the relationship
they gradually lose sight of their child altogether though at interval they receive a birthday or christmas letter from them and sometimes even answer it
the countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good natured as accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion might arise
he had no watch but he had a tortoise shell lorgnette on a black ribbon on the middle finger of his right hand was a massive gold ring with a cheap opal stone in it
the visitor waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down from his room to keep his host company at tea and was discreetly silent seeing that his host was frowning and preoccupied
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation but he was ready for any affable conversation as soon as his host should begin it
all at once his face expressed a sudden solicitude i say he began to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov excuse me i only mention it to remind you
you went to smerdyakov to find out about katerina_ivanovna but you came away without finding out anything about her you probably forgot
but it doesnt matter now never mind till to morrow he muttered to himself and you he added addressing his visitor i should have remembered that myself in a minute for that was just what was tormenting me
why do you interfere as if i should believe that you prompted me and that i didnt remember it of myself
ah yes broke from ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and his face grew gloomy with uneasiness yes i forgotten dont believe it then said the gentleman smiling amicably what the good of believing against your will
besides proofs are no help to believing especially material proofs thomas believed not because he saw church_of_christ risen but because he wanted to believe before he saw
i am very fond of them only fancy they imagine that they are serving the cause of religion because the devils show them their horns from the other world
look at the spiritualists for instance that they say is a material proof so to speak of the existence of another world
the other world and material proofs what next and if you come to that does proving there a devil prove that there a god
i want to join an idealist society i ll lead the opposition in it i ll say i am a realist but not a materialist he he
listen ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly got up from the table i seem to be delirious i am delirious in fact talk any nonsense you like i dont care
you wont drive me to fury as you did last time but i feel somehow ashamed i want to walk about the room
i sometimes dont see you and dont even hear your voice as i did last time but i always guess what you are prating for it i_
i myself speaking not you only i dont know whether i was dreaming last time or whether i really saw you
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went into the corner took a towel and did as he said and with a wet towel on his head began walking up and down the room
i ll wet a towel and put it on my head and perhaps you ll vanish into air i am so glad you treat me so familiarly the visitor began
i am in good spirits now though i ve a pain in my forehead and in the top of my head
fool laughed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov do you suppose i should stand on ceremony with you only please dont talk philosophy as you did last time
if you cant take yourself off talk of something amusing talk gossip you are a poor relation you ought to talk gossip
what a nightmare to have but i am not afraid of you i ll get the better of you i wont be taken to a mad house
est charmant poor relation yes i am in my natural shape for what am i on earth but a poor relation
by the way i am listening to you and am rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me for something real not simply your fancy as you persisted in declaring last time
never for one minute have i taken you for reality ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried with a sort of fury you are a lie you are my illness you are a phantom
it only that i dont know how to destroy you and i see i must suffer for a time you are my hallucination
you are the incarnation of myself but only of one side of me of my thoughts and feeling but only the nastiest and stupidest of them
from that point of view you might be of interest to me if only i had time to waste on you
when you flew out at alyosha_karamazov under the lamp post this evening and shouted to him you learnt it from him
excuse me excuse me i ll catch you how do you know that he visits me you were thinking of me then
so for one brief moment you did believe that i really exist the gentleman laughed blandly yes that was a moment of weakness
but i couldnt believe in you i dont know whether i was asleep or awake last time perhaps i was only dreaming then and didnt see you really at all
and why were you so surly with alyosha_karamazov just now he is a dear i ve treated him badly over father_zossima
dont talk of alyosha_karamazov how dare you you flunkey ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov laughed again you scold me but you laugh that a good sign
but you are ever so much more polite than you were last time and i know why that great resolution of yours dont speak of my resolution cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov savagely
i understand i understand est noble est charmant you are going to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself
est chevaleresque hold your tongue i ll kick you i shant be altogether sorry for then my object will be attained
joking apart it doesnt matter to me scold if you like though it better to be a trifle more polite even to me
if you kick me you must believe in my reality for people dont kick ghosts fool flunkey what words scolding you i scold myself ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov laughed again you are myself myself only with a different face
if i am like you in my way of thinking it all to my credit the gentleman declared with delicacy and dignity
you just say what i am thinking and are incapable of saying anything new you choose out only my worst thoughts and what more the stupid ones
you are stupid and vulgar you are awfully stupid no i cant put up with you what am i to do what am i to do
my dear friend above all things i want to behave like a gentleman and to be recognized as such the visitor began in an excess of deprecating and simple hearted pride typical of a poor relation
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said through his clenched teeth i am poor but i wont say very honest but it an axiom generally accepted in society that i am a fallen angel
i certainly cant conceive how i can ever have been an angel if i ever was it must have been so long ago that there no harm in forgetting it
now i only prize the reputation of being a gentlemanly person and live as i can trying to make myself agreeable
here when i stay with you from time to time my life gains a kind of reality and that what i like most of all
i love man genuinely i ve been greatly calumniated you see like you i suffer from the fantastic and so i love the realism of earth
here with you everything is circumscribed here all is formulated and geometrical while we have nothing but indeterminate equations i wander about here dreaming
i like dreaming besides on earth i become superstitious please dont laugh that just what i like to become superstitious
i adopt all your habits here i ve grown fond of going to the public baths would you believe it and i go and steam myself with merchants and priests
what i dream of is becoming incarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of some merchant wife weighing eighteen stone and of believing all she believes
my ideal is to go to church_of_christ and offer a candle in simple hearted faith upon my word it is then there would be an end to my sufferings
i like being doctored too in the spring there was an outbreak of smallpox and i went and was vaccinated in a foundling hospital if only you knew how i enjoyed myself that day
i subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the slavs but you are not listening do you know you are not at all well this evening
i know you went yesterday to that doctor well what about your health what did the doctor say fool ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov snapped out
but you are clever anyway you are scolding again i didnt ask out of sympathy you neednt answer now rheumatism has come in again fool
you keep saying the same thing but i had such an attack of rheumatism last year that i remember it to this day
repeated ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov the devil have rheumatism why not if i sometimes put on fleshly form i put on fleshly form
and i take the consequences satan sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto what what satan sum et nihil humanum that not bad for the devil
i am glad i ve pleased you at last but you didnt get that from me ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stopped suddenly seeming struck
that never entered my head that strange est du nouveau est ce pas this time i ll act honestly and explain to you
listen in dreams and especially in nightmares from indigestion or anything a man sees sometimes such artistic visions such complex and real actuality such events even a whole world of events woven into such a plot with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff as i swear leo tolstoy has never invented
yet such dreams are sometimes seen not by writers but by the most ordinary people officials journalists priests the subject is a complete enigma
well that how it is now though i am your hallucination yet just as in a nightmare i say original things which had not entered your head before
a statesman confessed to me indeed that all his best ideas came to him when he was asleep so i dont repeat your ideas yet i am only your nightmare nothing more
you are lying your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are not my nightmare and now you are asserting you are a dream
my dear fellow i ve adopted a special method to day i ll explain it to you afterwards stay where did i break off
oh yes i caught cold then only not here but yonder where is yonder tell me will you be here long
he ceased walking to and fro sat down on the sofa leaned his elbows on the table again and held his head tight in both hands
cant you go away ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov exclaimed almost in despair he pulled the wet towel off and flung it away in vexation
it was evidently of no use your nerves are out of order observed the gentleman with a carelessly easy though perfectly polite air
you are angry with me even for being able to catch cold though it happened in a most natural way
i was hurrying then to a diplomatic soirée at the house of a lady of high rank in petersburg who was aiming at influence in the ministry
well an evening suit white tie gloves though i was god knows where and had to fly through space to reach your earth
of course it took only an instant but you know a ray of light from the sun takes full eight minutes and fancy in an evening suit and open waistcoat
spirits dont freeze but when one in fleshly form well in brief i didnt think and set off and you know in those ethereal spaces in the water that is above the firmament there such a frost at least one cant call it frost you can fancy degrees below zero
you know the game the village girls play they invite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degrees of frost the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin off so it bleeds
but that only in degrees in degrees i imagine it would be enough to put your finger on the ax
and it would be the end of it if only there could be an ax there and can there be an ax there
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov interrupted carelessly and disdainfully he was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity
an ax the guest interrupted in surprise yes what would become of an ax there ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried suddenly with a sort of savage and insistent obstinacy
if it were to fall to any distance it would begin i think flying round the earth without knowing why like a satellite
the astronomers would calculate the rising and the setting of the ax gatzuk would put it in his calendar that all
what would become of an ax in space quelle idée you are stupid awfully stupid said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov peevishly
you want to get the better of me by realism to convince me that you exist but i dont want to believe you exist
fib more cleverly or i wont listen i wont believe it but i am not fibbing it all the truth the truth is unhappily hardly ever amusing
i see you persist in expecting something big of me and perhaps something fine that a great pity for i only give what i can
i ve tried all the medical faculty they can diagnose beautifully they have the whole of your disease at their finger tips but they ve no idea how to cure you
dont talk philosophy you ass philosophy indeed when all my right side is numb and i am moaning and groaning there was an enthusiastic little student here you may die
said he but you ll know perfectly what disease you are dying of and then what a way they have sending people to specialists
the old doctor who used to cure all sort of disease has completely disappeared i assure you now there are only specialists and they all advertise in the newspapers
if anything is wrong with your nose they send you to paris there they say is a european specialist who cures noses
if you go to paris he ll look at your nose i can only cure your right nostril he ll tell you for i dont cure the left nostril that not my speciality but go to vienna there there a specialist who will cure your left nostril
i fell back on popular remedies a german doctor advised me to rub myself with honey and salt in the bath house
we only diagnose they say but go to such and such a specialist he ll cure you what are you to do solely to get an extra bath i went smeared myself all over and it did me
no good at all in despair i wrote to count mattei in milan he sent me a book and some drops bless him and only fancy hoff malt extract cured me
i bought it by accident drank a bottle and a half of it and i was ready to dance it took it away completely
i made up my mind to write to the papers to thank him i was prompted by a feeling of gratitude and only fancy it led to no end of a bother not a single paper would take my letter
it would be very reactionary they said no one will believe it le diable existe point you better remain anonymous they advised me
what use is a letter of thanks if it anonymous i laughed with the man at the newspaper office it reactionary to believe in god in our day i said
but i am the devil so i may be believed in we quite understand that they said who doesnt believe in the devil
yet it wont do it might injure our reputation as a joke if you like but i thought as a joke it wouldnt be very witty
so it wasnt printed and do you know i have felt sore about it to this day my best feeling gratitude for instance are literally denied me simply from my social position
philosophical reflections again ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov snarled malignantly god preserve me from it but one cant help complaining sometimes i am a slandered man
you upbraid me every moment with being stupid one can see you are young my dear fellow intelligence isnt the only thing
i have naturally a kind and merry heart i also write vaudevilles of all sort you seem to take me for hlestakov grown old but my fate is a far more serious one
before time was by some decree which i could never make out i was pre destined to deny and yet i am genuinely good hearted and not at all inclined to negation
no you must go and deny without denial there no criticism and what would a journal be without a column of criticism
but nothing but hosannah is not enough for life the hosannah must be tried in the crucible of doubt and so on in the same style
without criticism it would be nothing but one hosannah but i dont meddle in that i didnt create it i am not answerable for it
well they ve chosen their scapegoat they ve made me write the column of criticism and so life was made possible we understand that comedy i for instance simply ask for annihilation
no live i am told for there be nothing without you if everything in the universe were sensible nothing would happen
there would be no events without you and there must be events so against the grain i serve to produce events and do what irrational because i am commanded to
for all their indisputable intelligence man take this farce as something serious and that is their tragedy they suffer of course
but then they live they live a real life not a fantastic one for suffering is life without suffering what would be the pleasure of it
it would be transformed into an endless church_of_christ service it would be holy but tedious but what about me i suffer but still i dont live
i am a sort of phantom in life who has lost all beginning and end and who has even forgotten his own name
you are for ever angry all you care about is intelligence but i repeat again that i would give away all this super stellar life all the ranks and honors simply to be transformed into the soul of a merchant wife weighing eighteen stone and set candles at god shrine
i am in an indeterminate equation you are laughing no you are not laughing you are angry again then even you dont believe in god said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a smile of hatred
what can i say that is if you are in earnest is there a god or not ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried with the same savage intensity
ah then you are in earnest my dear fellow upon my word i dont know there i ve said it now
you dont know but you see god no you are not some one apart you are myself you are i and nothing more
you are rubbish you are my fancy well if you like i have the same philosophy as you that would be true
je pense donc je suis i know that for a fact all the rest all these worlds god and even satan all that is not proved to my mind
does all that exist of itself or is it only an emanation of myself a logical development of my ego which alone has existed for ever but i make haste to stop for i believe you will be jumping up to beat me directly
you better tell me some anecdote said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov miserably there is an anecdote precisely on our subject or rather a legend not an anecdote
you reproach me with unbelief you see you say yet you dont believe but my dear fellow i am not the only one like that
we are all in a muddle over there now and all through your science once there used to be atoms five senses four elements and then everything hung together somehow
there were atoms in the ancient world even but since we ve learned that you ve discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and the devil knows what we had to lower our crest
there a regular muddle and above all superstition scandal there as much scandal among us as among you you know a little more in fact and spying indeed for we have our secret police department where private information is received
well this wild legend belongs to our middle ages not yours but ours and no one believes it even among us except the old lady of eighteen stone not your old lady i mean but ours
we ve everything you have i am revealing one of our secrets out of friendship for you though it forbidden this legend is about paradise
there was they say here on earth a thinker and philosopher he rejected everything laws conscience faith and above all the future life
he died he expected to go straight to darkness and death and he found a future life before him he was astounded and indignant
this is against my principles he said and he was punished for that that is you must excuse me i am just repeating what i heard myself it only a legend
he was sentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers in the dark we ve adopted the metric system you know and when he has finished that quadrillion the gates of heaven would be opened to him
and he ll be forgiven and what tortures have you in the other world besides the quadrillion kilometers asked ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov with a strange eagerness
in old day we had all sort but now they have taken chiefly to moral punishments the stings of conscience and all that nonsense
what tortures ah dont ask we got that too from you from the softening of your manners and who the better for it
only those who have got no conscience for how can they be tortured by conscience when they have none but decent people who have conscience and a sense of honor suffer for it
reforms when the ground has not been prepared for them especially if they are institutions copied from abroad do nothing but mischief
well this man who was condemned to the quadrillion kilometers stood still looked round and lay down across the road
take the soul of an enlightened russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the prophet jonah who sulked for three day and nights in the belly of the whale and you get the character of that thinker who lay across the road
the ancient fire was better i wont go i refuse on principle what did he lie on there well i suppose there was something to lie on
you are not laughing bravo cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov still with the same strange eagerness now he was listening with an unexpected curiosity
well is he lying there now that the point that he isnt he lay there almost a thousand years
and then he got up and went on what an ass cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov laughing nervously and still seeming to be pondering something intently
does it make any difference whether he lies there for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers it would take a billion years to walk it
much more than that i havent got a pencil and paper or i could work it out but he got there long ago and that where the story begins
what he got there but how did he get the billion years to do it why you keep thinking of our present earth
why it become extinct been frozen cracked broken to bits disintegrated into its elements again the water above the firmament then again a comet again a sun again from the sun it becomes earth and the same sequence may have been repeated endlessly and exactly the same to every detail most unseemly and insufferably tedious
why the moment the gates of paradise were open and he walked in before he had been there two second by his watch though to my thinking his watch must have long dissolved into its elements on the way he cried out that those two second were worth walking not a quadrillion kilometers but a quadrillion of quadrillions raised to the quadrillionth power
in fact he sang hosannah and overdid it so that some person there of lofty ideas wouldnt shake hands with him at first he become too rapidly reactionary they said
but our present earth may have been repeated a billion time well well what happened when he arrived the russian temperament
i repeat it a legend i give it for what it worth so that the sort of ideas we have on such subjects even now
i ve caught you ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried with an almost childish delight as though he had succeeded in remembering something at last
that anecdote about the quadrillion years i made up myself i was seventeen then i was at the high school
i made up that anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow called korovkin it was at moscow the anecdote is so characteristic that i couldnt have taken it from anywhere
thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like that even when people are being taken to execution it come back to me in a dream
i thought i forgotten it but i ve unconsciously recalled it i recalled it myself it was not you telling it you are that dream
you are a dream not a living creature from the vehemence with which you deny my existence laughed the gentleman i am convinced that you believe in me
not in the slightest i havent a hundredth part of a grain of faith in you but you have the thousandth of a grain
homeopathic doses perhaps are the strongest confess that you have faith even to the ten thousandth of a grain not for one minute cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov furiously
but i should like to believe in you he added strangely aha there an admission but i am good natured i ll come to your assistance again
listen it was i caught you not you me i told you your anecdote you forgotten on purpose so as to destroy your faith in me completely
but hesitation suspense conflict between belief and disbelief is sometimes such torture to a conscientious man such as you are that it better to hang oneself at once
you are lying the object of your visit is to convince me of your existence just so knowing that you are inclined to believe in me i administered some disbelief by telling you that anecdote
as soon as you disbelieve in me completely you ll begin assuring me to my face that i am not a dream but a reality
i lead you to belief and disbelief by turns and i have my motive in it it the new method i know you
i shall sow in you only a tiny grain of faith and it will grow into an oak tree and such an oak tree that sitting on it you will long to enter the ranks of the hermits in the wilderness and the saintly women for that is what you are secretly longing for
then i shall have attained my object which is an honorable one you ll dine on locusts you ll wander into the wilderness to save your soul
then it for the salvation of my soul you are working is it you scoundrel one must do a good work sometimes
did you ever tempt those holy man who ate locusts and prayed seventeen years in the wilderness till they were overgrown with moss
one forgets the whole world and all the worlds and sticks to one such saint because he is a very precious diamond
how ill humored you are fool my dear fellow i ve done nothing else one such soul you know is sometimes worth a whole constellation
we have our system of reckoning you know the conquest is priceless and some of them on my word are not inferior to you in culture though you wont believe it
they can contemplate such depths of belief and disbelief at the same moment that sometimes it really seems that they are within a hair breadth of being turned upside down as the actor gorbunov says
my dear fellow observed the visitor sententiously it better to get off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all
as an afflicted marquis observed not long ago he must have been treated by a specialist in confession to his spiritual father_zossima a jesuit
well did you get your nose pulled i was present it was simply charming give me back my nose
my son said the priest evasively all things are accomplished in accordance with the inscrutable decrees of providence and what seems a misfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary though unapparent benefits
if stern destiny has deprived you of your nose it to your advantage that no one can ever pull you by your nose
i be delighted to have my nose pulled every day of my life if it were only in its proper place
he said and he beat his breast holy father_zossima that no comfort cried the despairing marquis my son sighs the priest you cant expect every blessing at once
this is murmuring against providence who even in this has not forgotten you for if you repine as you repined just now declaring you be glad to have your nose pulled for the rest of your life your desire has already been fulfilled indirectly for when you lost your nose you were led by the nose
fool how stupid cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov my dear friend i only wanted to amuse you but i swear that the genuine jesuit casuistry
and i swear that it all happened word for word as i ve told you it happened lately and gave me a great deal of trouble
the unhappy young man shot himself that very night when he got home i was by his side till the very last moment
those jesuit confessionals are really my most delightful diversion at melancholy moments here another incident that happened only the other day
a little blonde norman girl of twenty a buxom unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouth water comes to an old priest she bends down and whispers her sin into the grating
why my daughter have you fallen again already cries the priest sancta maria what do i hear not the same man this time how long is this going on
ah mon pčre answers the sinner with tears of penitence ça lui fait tant de plaisir et moi si peu de peine
arent you ashamed fancy such an answer i drew back it was the cry of nature better than innocence itself if you like
i heard the priest at the grating making an appointment with her for the evening though he was an old man hard as flint he fell in an instant
i absolved her sin on the spot and was turning to go but i was forced to turn back it was nature the truth of nature asserted its rights
leave me alone you are beating on my brain like a haunting nightmare ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov moaned miserably helpless before his apparition
what you are turning up your nose again angry again i dont know how to please you i am bored with you agonizingly and insufferably
i repeat moderate your expectations dont demand of me everything great and noble and you ll see how well we shall get on said the gentleman impressively
you are really angry with me for not having appeared to you in a red glow with thunder and lightning with scorched wings but have shown myself in such a modest form
i would give anything to be able to shake you off you are wounded in the first place in your esthetic feeling and secondly in your pride
how could such a vulgar devil visit such a great man as you yes there is that romantic strain in you that was so derided by byelinsky
i did think as a joke of appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the caucasus with a star of the lion and the sun on my coat
but i was positively afraid of doing it for you have thrashed me for daring to pin the lion and the sun on my coat instead of at least the polar star or the sirius
i cant help it young man as i got ready to come to you and you keep on saying i am stupid but mercy on us
i make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence mephistopheles declared to faust that he desired evil but did only good
well he can say what he likes it quite the opposite with me i am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth and genuinely desires good
i was there when the word who died on the cross rose up into heaven bearing on his bosom the soul of the penitent thief
i heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphim which shook heaven and all creation and i swear to you by all that sacred i longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all
the word had almost escaped me had almost broken from my lips you know how susceptible and esthetically impressionable i am
but common sense oh a most unhappy trait in my character kept me in due bounds and i let the moment pass for what would have happened i reflected what would have happened after my hosannah
and so solely from a sense of duty and my social position i was forced to suppress the good moment and to stick to my nasty task
everything on earth would have been extinguished at once and no events could have occurred somebody takes all the credit of what good for himself and nothing but nastiness is left for me
why am i of all creatures in the world doomed to be cursed by all decent people and even to be kicked for if i put on mortal form i am bound to take such consequences sometimes
i know of course there a secret in it but they wont tell me the secret for anything for then perhaps seeing the meaning of it i might bawl hosannah and the indispensable minus would disappear at once and good sense would reign supreme throughout the whole world
and that of course would mean the end of everything even of magazines and newspapers for who would take them in
but i dont envy the honor of a life of idle imposture i am not ambitious i know that at the end of all things i shall be reconciled
but till that happens i am sulking and fulfill my destiny though it against the grain that is to ruin thousands for the sake of saving one
how many soul have had to be ruined and how many honorable reputations destroyed for the sake of that one righteous man job over whom they made such a fool of me in old day
yes till the secret is revealed there are two sort of truths for me one their truth yonder which i know nothing about so far and the other my own
i too shall walk my quadrillion and learn the secret and there no knowing which will turn out the better are you asleep
all my stupid ideas outgrown thrashed out long ago and flung aside like a dead carcass you present to me as something new
i might well be ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov groaned angrily there no pleasing you and i thought i should fascinate you by my literary style
that hosannah in the skies really wasnt bad was it and then that ironical tone la heine eh no i was never such a flunkey
my dear fellow i know a most charming and attractive young russian gentleman a young thinker and a great lover of literature and art the author of a promising poem entitled the grand inquisitor
how then could my soul beget a flunkey like you i was only thinking of him i forbid you to speak of the grand inquisitor cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov crimson with shame
and the geological cataclysm do you remember that was a poem now hold your tongue or i ll kill you
you ll kill me no excuse me i will speak i came to treat myself to that pleasure oh i love the dreams of my ardent young friends quivering with eagerness for life
there are new man you decided last spring when you were meaning to come here they propose to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism
i maintain that nothing need be destroyed that we only need to destroy the idea of god in man that how we have to set to work
stupid fellows they didnt ask my advice it that that we must begin with oh blind race of man who have no understanding
as soon as man have all of them denied god and i believe that period analogous with geological periods will come to pass the old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism and what more the old morality and everything will begin anew
man will unite to take from life all it can give but only for joy and happiness in the present world
from hour to hour extending his conquest of nature infinitely by his will and his science man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his old dreams of the joys of heaven
man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine titanic pride and the man god will appear every one will know that he is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like a god
his pride will teach him that it useless for him to repine at life being a moment and he will love his brother without need of reward
love will be sufficient only for a moment of life but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify its fire which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave and so on and so on in the same style
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov sat with his eye on the floor and his hands pressed to his ears but he began trembling all over
charming the voice continued the question now is my young thinker reflected is it possible that such a period will ever come
but as owing to man inveterate stupidity this cannot come about for at least a thousand years every one who recognizes the truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases on the new principles
if it does everything is determined and humanity is settled for ever in that sense all things are lawful for him
what more even if this period never comes to pass since there is anyway no god and no immortality the new man may well become the man god even if he is the only one in the whole world and promoted to his new position he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old slave man if necessary
there is no law for god where god stands the place is holy where i stand will be at once the foremost place
all things are lawful and that the end of it that all very charming but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction for doing it
but that our modern russian all over he cant bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction he is so in love with truth
but he did not succeed in finishing ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly snatched a glass from the table and flung it at the orator
the visitor talked obviously carried away by his own eloquence speaking louder and louder and looking ironically at his host
ah mais est bęte enfin cried the latter jumping up from the sofa and shaking the drops of tea off himself
he remembers luther inkstand he takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a dream it like a woman
i suspected you were only pretending to stop up your ears a loud persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov jumped up from the sofa do you hear you better open cried the visitor it your brother alyosha_karamazov with the most interesting and surprising news i ll be bound
i felt he was coming and of course he has not come for nothing of course he brings news ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov exclaimed frantically
be silent deceiver i knew it was alyosha_karamazov open open to him there a snowstorm and he is your brother
monsieur sait il le temps qu il fait est ne pas mettre un chien dehors the knocking continued ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov wanted to rush to the window but something seemed to fetter his arms and legs
he strained every effort to break his chains but in vain the knocking at the window grew louder and louder at last the chains were broken and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov leapt up from the sofa
both candles had almost burnt out the glass he had just thrown at his visitor stood before him on the table and there was no one on the sofa opposite
the knocking on the window frame went on persistently but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in his dream on the contrary it was quite subdued
he looked round him wildly it was not a dream no i swear it was not a dream it all happened just now cried ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
he rushed to the window and opened the movable pane alyosha_karamazov i told you not to come he cried fiercely to his brother
in two words what do you want in two words do you hear an hour ago smerdyakov hanged himself alyosha_karamazov answered from the yard
come round to the steps i ll open at once said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov going to open the door to alyosha_karamazov chapter
who said that alyosha_karamazov coming in told ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov that a little over an hour ago marya_kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him smerdyakov had taken his own life
it was he i went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on a nail in the wall
on alyosha_karamazov inquiring whether she had informed the police she answered that she had told no one but i flew straight to you i ve run all the way
she seemed perfectly crazy alyosha_karamazov reported and was shaking like a leaf when alyosha_karamazov ran with her to the cottage he found smerdyakov still hanging
on the table lay a note i destroy my life of my own will and desire so as to throw no blame on any one
alyosha_karamazov left the note on the table and went straight to the police captain and told him all about it
he had not taken his eye off him while he told his story as though struck by something in his expression
and from him i ve come straight to you said alyosha_karamazov in conclusion looking intently into ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov face brother he cried suddenly you must be terribly ill
you look and dont seem to understand what i tell you it a good thing you came said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov as though brooding and not hearing alyosha_karamazov exclamation
i knew he had hanged himself from whom i dont know but i knew did i know yes he told me
he told me so just now ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov stood in the middle of the room and still spoke in the same brooding tone looking at the ground
who is he asked alyosha_karamazov involuntarily looking round he slipped away ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov raised his head and smiled softly
he was afraid of you of a dove like you you are a pure cherub dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov calls you a cherub
cherub the thunderous rapture of the seraphim what are seraphim perhaps a whole constellation but perhaps that constellation is only a chemical molecule
there a constellation of the lion and the sun dont you know it brother sit down said alyosha_karamazov in alarm
for goodness sake sit down on the sofa you are delirious put your head on the pillow that right would you like a wet towel on your head
perhaps it will do you good give me the towel it here on the chair i just threw it down there
i know where it is here said alyosha_karamazov finding a clean towel folded up and unused by ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov dressing table in the other corner of the room
it not here dont worry yourself ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov looked strangely at the towel recollection seemed to come back to him for an instant
stay he got up from the sofa an hour ago i took that new towel from there and wetted it i wrapped it round my head and threw it down here
how is it it dry there was no other you put that towel on your head asked alyosha_karamazov yes and walked up and down the room an hour ago
why have the candles burnt down so what the time nearly twelve no no no ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried suddenly it was not a dream
he was here he was sitting here on that sofa when you knocked at the window i threw a glass at him this one
wait a minute i was asleep last time but this dream was not a dream it has happened before i have dreams now alyosha_karamazov yet they are not dreams but reality
i walk about talk and see though i am asleep but he was sitting here on that sofa there he is frightfully stupid alyosha_karamazov frightfully stupid
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov laughed suddenly and began pacing about the room who is stupid of whom are you talking brother alyosha_karamazov asked anxiously again
he taunted me with being angry at his being a simple devil and not satan with scorched wings in thunder and lightning
the devil he taken to visiting me he been here twice almost three time but he is not satan that a lie
if you undressed him you be sure to find he had a tail long and smooth like a danish dog a yard long dun color
he is an impostor he is simply a devil a paltry trivial devil he goes to the baths alyosha_karamazov you are cold
you ve been in the snow would you like some tea what is it cold shall i tell her to bring some
alyosha_karamazov ran to the washing stand wetted the towel persuaded ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to sit down again and put the wet towel round his head
c est ne pas mettre un chien dehors he sat down beside him what were you telling me just now about lise
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov began again he was becoming very talkative i like lise i said something nasty about her it was a lie
i like her i am afraid for katya to morrow i am more afraid of her than of anything on account of the future
she will cast me off to morrow and trample me under foot she thinks that i am ruining mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov from jealousy on her account
yes she thinks that but it not so to morrow the cross but not the gallows no i shant hang myself do you know i can never commit suicide alyosha_karamazov
is it because i am base i am not a coward is it from love of life how did i know that smerdyakov had hanged himself
yes it was he told me so and you are quite convinced that there has been some one here asked alyosha_karamazov
yes on that sofa in the corner you would have driven him away you did drive him away he disappeared when you arrived
i love your face alyosha_karamazov did you know that i loved your face and he is myself alyosha_karamazov all that base in me all that mean and contemptible
yes i am a romantic he guessed it though it a libel he is frightfully stupid but it to his advantage
he has cunning animal cunning he knew how to infuriate me he kept taunting me with believing in him and that was how he made me listen to him
he fooled me like a boy he told me a great deal that was true about myself though i should never have owned it to myself
do you know alyosha_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov added in an intensely earnest and confidential tone i should be awfully glad to think that it was he and not i_
he has worn you out said alyosha_karamazov looking compassionately at his brother he been teasing me and you know he does it so cleverly so cleverly
conscience what is conscience i make it up for myself why am i tormented by it from habit from the universal habit of mankind for the seven thousand years
so let us give it up and we shall be gods it was he said that it was he said that
and not you not you alyosha_karamazov could not help crying looking frankly at his brother never mind him anyway have done with him and forget him
and let him take with him all that you curse now and never come back yes but he is spiteful
he laughed at me he was impudent alyosha_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov said with a shudder of offense but he was unfair to me unfair to me about lots of things
oh you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue to confess you murdered your father_zossima that the valet murdered him at your instigation
he told lies about me to my face brother alyosha_karamazov interposed restrain yourself it was not you murdered him
you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue and you dont believe in virtue that what tortures you and makes you angry that why you are so vindictive
it not true that what he says he and he knows it he said that to me about me
it you say that not he exclaimed alyosha_karamazov mournfully and you say it because you are ill and delirious tormenting yourself
and he knows what he says no he knows what he says you are going from pride he says
you ll stand up and say it was i killed him and why do you writhe with horror you are lying i despise your opinion i despise your horror
and do you know you are longing for their praise he is a criminal a murderer but what a generous soul he wanted to save his brother and he confessed
he said that about me that a lie alyosha_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov cried suddenly with flashing eye i dont want the low rabble to praise me i swear i dont
that a lie that why i threw the glass at him and it broke against his ugly face brother calm yourself stop
alyosha_karamazov entreated him yes he knows how to torment one he cruel ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov went on unheeding i had an inkling from the first what he came for
granting that you go through pride still you had a hope that smerdyakov might be convicted and sent to siberia and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov would be acquitted while you would only be punished with moral condemnation do you hear
he laughed then and some people will praise you but now smerdyakov dead he has hanged himself and who ll believe you alone
but yet you are going you are going you ll go all the same you ve decided to go what are you going for now
that awful alyosha_karamazov i cant endure such questions who dare ask me such questions brother interposed alyosha_karamazov his heart sank with terror but he still seemed to hope to bring ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov to reason how
could he have told you of smerdyakov death before i came when no one knew of it and there was no time for any one to know of it
he told me said ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov firmly refusing to admit a doubt it was all he did talk about if you come to that
and it would be all right if you believed in virtue he said no matter if they disbelieve you you are going for the sake of principle
but you are a little pig like fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and what do you want with virtue why do you want to go meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to any one
because you dont know yourself why you go oh you give a great deal to know yourself why you go and can you have made up your mind
you ve not made up your mind you ll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not but you will go you know you ll go
you know that whichever way you decide the decision does not depend on you you ll go because you wont dare not to go
why wont you dare you must guess that for yourself that a riddle for you he got up and went away
you came and he went he called me a coward alyosha_karamazov le mot de énigme is that i am a coward
it is not for such eagles to soar above the earth it was he added that he and smerdyakov said the same
he must be killed katya despises me i ve seen that for a month past even lise will begin to despise me
you are going in order to be praised that a brutal lie and you despise me too alyosha_karamazov now i am going to hate you again
and i hate the monster too i hate the monster i dont want to save the monster let him rot in siberia
he begun singing a hymn oh to morrow i ll go stand before them and spit in their faces he jumped up in a frenzy flung off the towel and fell to pacing up and down the room again
alyosha_karamazov recalled what he had just said i seem to be sleeping awake i walk i speak i see but i am asleep
it seemed to be just like that now alyosha_karamazov did not leave him the thought passed through his mind to run for a doctor but he was afraid to leave his brother alone
there was no one to whom he could leave him by degrees ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov lost consciousness completely at last he still went on talking talking incessantly but quite incoherently and even articulated his words with difficulty
suddenly he staggered violently but alyosha_karamazov was in time to support him ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov let him lead him to his bed alyosha_karamazov undressed him somehow and put him to bed
he sat watching over him for another two hours the sick man slept soundly without stirring breathing softly and evenly alyosha_karamazov took a pillow and lay down on the sofa without undressing
as he fell asleep he prayed for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov he began to understand ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov illness the anguish of a proud determination
an earnest conscience god in whom he disbelieved and his truth were gaining mastery over his heart which still refused to submit
yes the thought floated through alyosha_karamazov head as it lay on the pillow yes if smerdyakov is dead no one will believe ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov evidence but he will go and give it
he will either rise up in the light of truth or he ll perish in hate revenging on himself and on every one his having served the cause he does not believe in alyosha_karamazov added bitterly and again he prayed for ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
alyosha_karamazov smiled softly god will conquer he thought book xii a judicial error chapter i the fatal day
at ten clock in the morning of the day following the events i have described the trial of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov began in our district court
i hasten to emphasize the fact that i am far from esteeming myself capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail or even in the actual order of events
i imagine that to mention everything with full explanation would fill a volume even a very large one and so i trust i may not be reproached for confining myself to what struck me
i may have selected as of most interest what was of secondary importance and may have omitted the most prominent and essential details
but i see i shall do better not to apologize i will do my best and the reader will see for himself that i have done all i can
and to begin with before entering the court i will mention what surprised me most on that day indeed as it appeared later every one was surprised at it too
we all knew that the affair had aroused great interest that every one was burning with impatience for the trial to begin that it had been a subject of talk conjecture exclamation and surmise for the last two months in local society
every one knew too that the case had become known throughout russia but yet we had not imagined that it had aroused such burning such intense interest in every one not only among ourselves but all over russia
visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province but from several other russian towns as well as from moscow and petersburg
this became evident at the trial this day among them were lawyers lady and even several distinguished personages every ticket of admission had been snatched up
a special place behind the table at which the three judges sat was set apart for the most distinguished and important of the man visitors a row of arm chairs had been placed there something exceptional which had never been allowed before
there was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they did not know where to seat them for every ticket had long since been eagerly sought for and distributed
i saw at the end of the room behind the platform a special partition hurriedly put up behind which all these lawyers were admitted and they thought themselves lucky to have standing room there for all chairs had been removed for the sake of space and the crowd behind the partition stood throughout the case closely packed shoulder to shoulder
some of the lady especially those who came from a distance made their appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed but the majority of the lady were oblivious even of dress
a peculiar fact established afterwards by many observations was that almost all the lady or at least the vast majority of them were on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov side and in favor of his being acquitted
a large proportion not less than half of the public were lady their faces betrayed hysterical intense almost morbid curiosity this was perhaps chiefly owing to his reputation as a conqueror of female hearts
it was known that two women rivals were to appear in the case one of them katerina_ivanovna was an object of general interest
all sort of extraordinary tales were told about her amazing anecdotes of her passion for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in spite of his crime
people said she intended to petition the government for leave to accompany the criminal to siberia and to be married to him somewhere in the mines
her pride and aristocratic connections were particularly insisted upon she had called upon scarcely any one in the town the appearance of grushenka in court was awaited with no less impatience
the public was looking forward with anxious curiosity to the meeting of the two rivals the proud aristocratic girl and the hetaira
they had already seen the woman who had ruined fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and his unhappy son and all almost without exception wondered how father_zossima and son could be so in love with such a very common ordinary russian girl who was not even pretty
but grushenka was a more familiar figure to the lady of the district than katerina_ivanovna in brief there was a great deal of talk
many lady quarreled violently with their husbands over differences of opinion about the dreadful case and it was only natural that the husbands of these lady far from being favorably disposed to the prisoner should enter the court bitterly prejudiced against him
in fact one may say pretty certainly that the masculine as distinguished from the feminine part of the audience were biased against the prisoner
i know for a fact that there were several serious family quarrels on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov account in our town there were numbers of severe frowning even vindictive faces
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov indeed had managed to offend many people during his stay in the town some of the visitors were of course in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov personally
but all were interested in the trial and the majority of the man were certainly hoping for the conviction of the criminal except perhaps the lawyers who were more interested in the legal than in the moral aspect of the case
his talent was well known and this was not the first time he had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces
everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer fetyukovitch and if he defended them such cases became celebrated and long remembered all over russia
it was said that ippolit_kirillovitch was in a tremor at meeting fetyukovitch and that they had been enemies from the beginning of their career in petersburg that though our sensitive prosecutor who always considered that he had been aggrieved by some one in petersburg because his talents had not been properly appreciated was keenly excited over the alyosha_karamazov case and was even dreaming of rebuilding his flagging fortunes by means of it fetyukovitch they said was his one anxiety
there were stories too about our prosecutor and about the president of the court but these rumor were not quite just
our prosecutor was not one of those man who lose heart in face of danger on the contrary his self confidence increased with the increase of danger
he would put his whole soul into some case and work at it as though his whole fate and his whole fortune depended on its result
this was the subject of some ridicule in the legal world for just by this characteristic our prosecutor had gained a wider notoriety than could have been expected from his modest position
it must be noted that our prosecutor was in general too hasty and morbidly impressionable people laughed particularly at his passion for psychology
in my opinion they were wrong and our prosecutor was i believe a character of greater depth than was generally supposed
but with his delicate health he had failed to make his mark at the outset of his career and had never made up for it later
as for the president of our court i can only say that he was a humane and cultured man who had a practical knowledge of his work and progressive views
he was rather ambitious but did not concern himself greatly about his future career the great aim of his life was to be a man of advanced ideas
he felt as we learnt afterwards rather strongly about the alyosha_karamazov case but from a social not from a personal standpoint
he was interested in it as a social phenomenon in its classification and its character as a product of our social conditions as typical of the national character and so on and so on
his attitude to the personal aspect of the case to its tragic significance and the person involved in it including the prisoner was rather indifferent and abstract as was perhaps fitting indeed
he was too a man of connections and property the court was packed and overflowing long before the judges made their appearance
on the right of the judges who were on a raised platform a table and two rows of chairs had been put ready for the jury
our court is the best hall in the town spacious lofty and good for sound on the left was the place for the prisoner and the counsel for the defense
on it lay fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov white silk dressing gown stained with blood the fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had been committed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov shirt with a blood stained sleeve his coat stained with blood in patches over the pocket in which he had put his handkerchief the handkerchief itself stiff with blood and by now quite yellow the pistol loaded by mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov at pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin with a view to suicide and taken from him on the sly at mokroe by trifon_borissovitch the envelope in which the three thousand roubles had been put ready for grushenka the narrow pink ribbon with which it had been tied and many other articles i dont remember
in the middle of the court near the judges was a table with the material proofs in the body of the hall at some distance came the seats for the public
but in front of the balustrade a few chairs had been placed for witnesses who remained in the court after giving their evidence
at ten clock the three judges arrived the president one honorary justice of the peace and one other the prosecutor of course entered immediately after
the president was a short stout thick set man of fifty with a dyspeptic complexion dark hair turning gray and cut short and a red ribbon of what order i dont remember
his face seemed to have grown suddenly thinner perhaps in a single night for i had seen him looking as usual only two day before
the prosecutor struck me and the others too as looking particularly pale almost green the president began with asking the court whether all the jury were present
but i see i cant go on like this partly because some things i did not hear others i did not notice and others i have forgotten but most of all because as i have said before i have literally no time or space to mention everything that was said and done
i remember the twelve jurymen four were petty officials of the town two were merchants and six peasants and artisans of the town
i remember long before the trial questions were continually asked with some surprise especially by lady can such a delicate complex and psychological case be submitted for decision to petty officials and even peasants and what can an official still more a peasant understand in such an affair
i only know that neither side objected to very many of the jurymen all the four officials in the jury were in fact man of no consequence and of low rank
except one who was rather younger they were gray headed man little known in society who had vegetated on a pitiful salary and who probably had elderly unpresentable wives and crowds of child perhaps even without shoes and stockings
at most they spent their leisure over cards and of course had never read a single book the two merchants looked respectable but were strangely silent and stolid
one of them was close shaven and was dressed in european style the other had a small gray beard and wore a red ribbon with some sort of a medal upon it on his neck
there is no need to speak of the artisans and the peasants the artisans of skotoprigonyevsk are almost peasants and even work on the land
so that one might well wonder as i did as soon as i had looked at them what man like that could possibly make of such a case
two of them also wore european dress and perhaps for that reason were dirtier and more uninviting looking than the others
yet their faces made a strangely imposing almost menacing impression they were stern and frowning at last the president opened the case of the murder of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov
i dont quite remember how he described him the court usher was told to bring in the prisoner and mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov made his appearance
there was a hush through the court one could have heard a fly i dont know how it was with others but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov made a most unfavorable impression on me
i heard afterwards that he had ordered it in moscow expressly for the occasion from his own tailor who had his measure
he walked in with his yard long strides looking stiffly straight in front of him and sat down in his place with a most unperturbed air
at the same moment the counsel for defense the celebrated fetyukovitch entered and a sort of subdued hum passed through the court
he was a tall spare man with long thin legs with extremely long thin pale fingers clean shaven face demurely brushed rather short hair and thin lips that were at time curved into something between a sneer and a smile
he looked an awful dandy in a brand new frock coat he wore immaculate black kid gloves and exquisite linen he looked about forty
his face would have been pleasant if it had not been for his eye which in themselves small and inexpressive were set remarkably close together with only the thin long nose as a dividing line between them
in fact there was something strikingly birdlike about his face he was in evening dress and white tie i remember the president first questions to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov about his name his calling and so on
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov answered sharply and his voice was so unexpectedly loud that it made the president start and look at the prisoner with surprise
then followed a list of person who were to take part in the proceedings that is of the witnesses and experts it was a long list
four of the witnesses were not present pyotr_alexandrovitch_miüsov who had given evidence at the preliminary inquiry but was now in paris madame_hohlakov and maximov who were absent through illness and smerdyakov through his sudden death of which an official statement from the police was presented
the news of smerdyakov death produced a sudden stir and whisper in the court many of the audience of course had not heard of the sudden suicide
what struck people most was mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sudden outburst as soon as the statement of smerdyakov death was made he cried out aloud from his place
i remember how his counsel rushed to him and how the president addressed him threatening to take stern measures if such an irregularity were repeated
he was a dog and died like a dog mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov nodded and in a subdued voice repeated several time abruptly to his counsel with no show of regret
i wont again i wont it escaped me i wont do it again and of course this brief episode did him no good with the jury or the public
his character was displayed and it spoke for itself it was under the influence of this incident that the opening statement was read
it was rather short but circumstantial it only stated the chief reason why he had been arrested why he must be tried and so on
yet it made a great impression on me the clerk read it loudly and distinctly the whole tragedy was suddenly unfolded before us concentrated in bold relief in a fatal and pitiless light
i remember how immediately after it had been read the president asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in a loud impressive voice prisoner do you plead guilty
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly rose from his seat i plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation he exclaimed again in a startling almost frenzied voice to idleness and debauchery
i meant to become an honest man for good just at the moment when i was struck down by fate but i am not guilty of the death of that old man my enemy and my father_zossima
no no i am not guilty of robbing him i could not be dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov is a scoundrel but not a thief
the president again briefly but impressively admonished him to answer only what was asked and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations
he sat down again visibly trembling all over then he ordered the case to proceed all the witnesses were led up to take the oath
then i saw them all together the brothers of the prisoner were however allowed to give evidence without taking the oath
after an exhortation from the priest and the president the witnesses were led away and were made to sit as far as possible apart from one another
i do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for the prosecution were separated into groups by the president and whether it was arranged to call them in a certain order
then they began calling them up one by one chapter ii dangerous witnesses but no doubt it was so i only know that the witnesses for the prosecution were called first
besides my account would be to some extent superfluous because in the speeches for the prosecution and for the defense the whole course of the evidence was brought together and set in a strong and significant light and i took down parts of those two remarkable speeches in full and will quote them in due course together with one extraordinary and quite unexpected episode which occurred before the final speeches and undoubtedly influenced the sinister and fatal outcome of the trial
i will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one peculiar characteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed by all that is the overwhelming strength of the prosecution as compared with the arguments the defense had to rely upon
every one realized it from the first moment that the facts began to group themselves round a single point and the whole horrible and bloody crime was gradually revealed
every one perhaps felt from the first that the case was beyond dispute that there was no doubt about it that there could be really no discussion and that the defense was only a matter of form and that the prisoner was guilty obviously and conclusively guilty
i imagine that even the lady who were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of the interesting prisoner were at the same time without exception convinced of his guilt
what more i believe they would have been mortified if his guilt had not been so firmly established as that would have lessened the effect of the closing scene of the criminal acquittal
i repeat i dont intend to describe all the questions step by step that he would be acquitted all the lady strange to say were firmly persuaded up to the very last moment
he is guilty but he will be acquitted from motives of humanity in accordance with the new ideas the new sentiments that had come into fashion and so on and so on
and that was why they had crowded into the court so impatiently the man were more interested in the contest between the prosecutor and the famous fetyukovitch
all were wondering and asking themselves what could even a talent like fetyukovitch make of such a desperate case and so they followed his achievements step by step with concentrated attention
person of experience suspected that he had some design that he was working towards some object but it was almost impossible to guess what it was
but fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end up to his speech his confidence and self reliance were unmistakable however
every one noticed with pleasure moreover that he after so short a stay not more than three day perhaps among us had so wonderfully succeeded in mastering the case and had studied it to a nicety
people described with relish afterwards how cleverly he had taken down all the witnesses for the prosecution and as far as possible perplexed them and what more had aspersed their reputation and so depreciated the value of their evidence
but it was supposed that he did this rather by way of sport so to speak for professional glory to show nothing had been omitted of the accepted methods for all were convinced that he could do no real good by such disparagement of the witnesses and probably was more aware of this than any one having some idea of his own in the background
some concealed weapon of defense which he would suddenly reveal when the time came but meanwhile conscious of his strength he seemed to be diverting himself
so for instance when grigory_vassilyevitch fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov old servant who had given the most damning piece of evidence about the open door was examined the counsel for the defense positively fastened upon him when his turn came to question him
it must be noted that grigory_vassilyevitch entered the hall with a composed and almost stately air not the least disconcerted by the majesty of the court or the vast audience listening to him
he gave evidence with as much confidence as though he had been talking with his marfa only perhaps more respectfully it was impossible to make him contradict himself
the prosecutor questioned him first in detail about the family life of the karamazovs the family picture stood out in lurid colors
in spite of his profound reverence for the memory of his deceased master he yet bore witness that he had been unjust to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and hadnt brought up his child as he should
he have been devoured by lice when he was little if it hadnt been for me he added describing mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov early childhood
it was plain to ear and eye that the witness was guileless and impartial it wasnt fair either of the father_zossima to wrong his son over his mother property which was by right his
in reply to the prosecutor question what grounds he had for asserting that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had wronged his son in their money relations grigory_vassilyevitch to the surprise of every one had no proof at all to bring forward but he still persisted that the arrangement with the son was unfair and that he ought to have paid him several thousand roubles more
i must note by the way that the prosecutor asked this question whether fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had really kept back part of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov inheritance with marked persistence of all the witnesses who could be asked it not excepting alyosha_karamazov and ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but he obtained no exact information from any one all alleged that it was so but were unable to bring forward any distinct proof
grigory_vassilyevitch description of the scene at the dinner table when dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov had burst in and beaten his father_zossima threatening to come back to kill him made a sinister impression on the court especially as the old servant composure in telling it his parsimony of words and peculiar phraseology were as effective as eloquence
he observed that he was not angry with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov for having knocked him down and struck him on the face he had forgiven him long ago he said
of the deceased smerdyakov he observed crossing himself that he was a lad of ability but stupid and afflicted and worse still an infidel and that it was fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and his elder son who had taught him to be so
but he defended smerdyakov honesty almost with warmth and related how smerdyakov had once found the master money in the yard and instead of concealing it had taken it to his master who had rewarded him with a gold piece for it and trusted him implicitly from that time forward
he maintained obstinately that the door into the garden had been open but he was asked so many questions that i cant recall them all
at last the counsel for the defense began to cross examine him and the first question he asked was about the envelope in which fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov was supposed to have put three thousand roubles for a certain person
grigory_vassilyevitch answered that he had not seen it and had never heard of the money from any one till everybody was talking about it
this question about the envelope fetyukovitch put to every one who could conceivably have known of it as persistently as the prosecutor asked his question about dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov inheritance and got the same answer from all that no one had seen the envelope though many had heard of it
have you ever seen it you who were for so many years in close attendance on your master from the beginning every one noticed fetyukovitch persistence on this subject
of what was that balsam or rather decoction made which as we learn from the preliminary inquiry you used on that evening to rub your lumbago in the hope of curing it
now with your permission i ll ask you a question fetyukovitch said suddenly and unexpectedly grigory_vassilyevitch looked blankly at the questioner and after a brief silence muttered there was saffron in it
nothing but saffron dont you remember any other ingredient there was milfoil in it too and pepper perhaps
fetyukovitch queried yes there was pepper too etcetera and all dissolved in vodka in spirit there was a faint sound of laughter in the court
after rubbing your back i believe you drank what was left in the bottle with a certain pious prayer only known to your wife
you see in spirit i did did you drink much roughly speaking a wine glass or two it might have been a tumbler full
a tumbler full even perhaps a tumbler and a half grigory_vassilyevitch did not answer he seemed to see what was meant
a glass and a half of neat spirit is not at all bad dont you think you might see the gates of heaven open not only the door into the garden
grigory_vassilyevitch remained silent there was another laugh in the court the president made a movement do you know for a fact fetyukovitch persisted whether you were awake or not when you saw the open door
i was on my legs that not a proof that you were awake there was again laughter in the court
could you have answered at that moment if any one had asked you a question for instance what year it is
i dont know and what year is it anno domini do you know grigory_vassilyevitch stood with a perplexed face looking straight at his tormentor
strange to say it appeared he really did not know what year it was but perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands
i am a servant grigory_vassilyevitch said suddenly in a loud and distinct voice if my betters think fit to make game of me it is my duty to suffer it
fetyukovitch was a little taken aback and the president intervened reminding him that he must ask more relevant questions fetyukovitch bowed with dignity and said that he had no more questions to ask of the witness
the public and the jury of course were left with a grain of doubt in their minds as to the evidence of a man who might while undergoing a certain cure have seen the gates of heaven and who did not even know what year he was living in
the president turning to the prisoner asked him whether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness
but before grigory_vassilyevitch left the box another episode occurred except about the door all he has said is true cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov in a loud voice
for combing the lice off me i thank him for forgiving my blows i thank him the old man has been honest all his life and as faithful to my father_zossima as seven hundred poodles
prisoner be careful in your language the president admonished him i am not a poodle grigory_vassilyevitch muttered all right it i am a poodle myself cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
if it an insult i take it to myself and i beg his pardon i was a beast and cruel to him
i was cruel to ćsop too what ćsop the president asked sternly again oh pierrot my father_zossima fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
the president again and again warned mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov impressively and very sternly to be more careful in his language you are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges
the counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with the evidence of mr_rakitin i may remark that mr_rakitin was one of the leading witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance
it appeared that he knew everything his knowledge was amazing he had been everywhere seen everything talked to everybody knew every detail of the biography of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and all the karamazovs
but he described minutely mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov exploits in the metropolis all his compromising doings and sayings and told the story of captain snegiryov wisp of tow
of the envelope it is true he had only heard from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov himself but even mr_rakitin could say nothing positive about mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov inheritance and confined himself to contemptuous generalities
who could tell which of them was to blame and which was in debt to the other with their crazy alyosha_karamazov way of muddling things so that no one could make head or tail of it
he attributed the tragic crime to the habits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the distressed condition of russia due to the lack of appropriate institutions
he was in fact allowed some latitude of speech this was the first occasion on which mr_rakitin showed what he could do and attracted notice
the prosecutor knew that the witness was preparing a magazine article on the case and afterwards in his speech as we shall see later quoted some ideas from the article showing that he had seen it already
the picture drawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one and greatly strengthened the case for the prosecution altogether mr_rakitin discourse fascinated the public by its independence and the extraordinary nobility of its ideas
but mr_rakitin in his youthful ardor made a slight blunder of which the counsel for the defense at once adroitly took advantage
answering certain questions about grushenka and carried away by the loftiness of his own sentiments and his success of which he was of course conscious he went so far as to speak somewhat contemptuously of agrafena_alexandrovna as the kept mistress of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
there were even two or three outbreaks of applause when he spoke of serfdom and the distressed condition of russia
he would have given a good deal to take back his words afterwards for fetyukovitch caught him out over it at once
and it was all because mr_rakitin had not reckoned on the lawyer having been able to become so intimately acquainted with every detail in so short a time
allow me to ask began the counsel for the defense with the most affable and even respectful smile you are of course the same mr_rakitin whose pamphlet the life of the deceased elder father_zossima published by the diocesan authorities full of profound and religious reflections and preceded by an excellent and devout dedication to the bishop i have just read with such pleasure
i did not write it for publication it was published afterwards muttered mr_rakitin for some reason fearfully disconcerted and almost ashamed
oh that excellent a thinker like you can and indeed ought to take the widest view of every social question
your most instructive pamphlet has been widely circulated through the patronage of the bishop and has been of appreciable service but this is the chief thing i should like to learn from you
you stated just now that you were very intimately acquainted with madame_svyetlov it must be noted that grushenka surname was svyetlov
i heard it for the first time that day during the case i cannot answer for all my acquaintances i am a young man and who can be responsible for every one he meets
cried mr_rakitin flushing all over i understand i quite understand cried fetyukovitch as though he too were embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself
you like any other might well be interested in an acquaintance with a young and beautiful woman who would readily entertain the élite of the youth of the neighborhood but
it has come to my knowledge that madame_svyetlov was particularly anxious a couple of months ago to make the acquaintance of the younger alyosha_karamazov alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and promised you twenty five roubles if you would bring him to her in his monastic dress
and that actually took place on the evening of the day on which the terrible crime which is the subject of the present investigation was committed
you brought alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov to madame_svyetlov and did you receive the twenty five roubles from madame_svyetlov as a reward that what i wanted to hear from you
i only wanted to know it was a joke i dont see of what interest that can be to you
i took it for a joke meaning to give it back later then you did take but you have not given it back yet or have you
that of no consequence muttered mr_rakitin i refuse to answer such questions of course i shall give it back
the president intervened but fetyukovitch declared he had no more questions to ask of the witness mr_rakitin left the witness box not absolutely without a stain upon his character
the effect left by the lofty idealism of his speech was somewhat marred and fetyukovitch expression as he watched him walk away seemed to suggest to the public this is a specimen of the lofty minded person who accuse him
i remember that this incident too did not pass off without an outbreak from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov enraged by the tone in which mr_rakitin had referred to grushenka he suddenly shouted karl_bernard
when after mr_rakitin cross examination the president asked the prisoner if he had anything to say mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried loudly since i ve been arrested he has borrowed money from me
he is a contemptible karl_bernard and opportunist and he doesnt believe in god he took the bishop in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov of course was pulled up again for the intemperance of his language but mr_rakitin was done for
he appeared in ragged and dirty clothes muddy boots and in spite of the vigilance and expert observation of the police officers he turned out to be hopelessly drunk
captain snegiryov evidence was a failure too but from quite a different reason on being asked about mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov attack upon him he refused to answer
god bless him ilusha told me not to god will make it up to me yonder who told you not to tell
of whom are you talking ilusha my little son father_zossima father how he insulted you he said that at the stone
now he is dying the captain suddenly began sobbing and plumped down on his knees before the president he was hurriedly led away amidst the laughter of the public
fetyukovitch went on making the most of every opportunity and amazed people more and more by his minute knowledge of the case
the effect prepared by the prosecutor did not come off at all thus for example trifon_borissovitch made a great impression of course very prejudicial to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
he calculated almost on his fingers that on his first visit to mokroe mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov must have spent three thousand roubles or very little less
and as for our lousy peasants it wasnt a case of flinging half a rouble in the street he made them presents of twenty five roubles each at least he didnt give them less
just think what he squandered on those gypsy girls alone and what a lot of money was simply stolen from him
and if any one did steal he did not leave a receipt how could one catch the thief when he was flinging his money away all the time
our peasants are robbers you know they have no care for their soul and the way he went on with the girls our village girls
they re completely set up since then i tell you they used to be poor he recalled in fact every item of expense and added it all up
so the theory that only fifteen hundred had been spent and the rest had been put aside in a little bag seemed inconceivable
i saw three thousand as clear as a penny in his hands i saw it with my own eye i should think i ought to know how to reckon money cried trifon_borissovitch doing his best to satisfy his betters
when fetyukovitch had to cross examine him he scarcely tried to refute his evidence but began asking him about an incident at the first carousal at mokroe a month before the arrest when timofey and another peasant called akim had picked up on the floor in the passage a hundred roubles dropped by mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov when he was drunk and had given them to trifon_borissovitch and received a rouble each from him for doing so
well asked the lawyer did you give that hundred roubles back to mr alyosha_karamazov trifon_borissovitch shuffled in vain
he was obliged after the peasants had been examined to admit the finding of the hundred roubles only adding that he had religiously returned it all to dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov in perfect honesty and it only because his honor was in liquor at the time he wouldnt remember it
but as he had denied the incident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called to prove it his evidence as to returning the money to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was naturally regarded with great suspicion
so one of the most dangerous witnesses brought forward by the prosecution was again discredited the same thing happened with the poles
they took up an attitude of pride and independence they vociferated loudly that they had both been in the service of the crown and that pan mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had offered them three thousand to buy their honor and that they had seen a large sum of money in his hands
pan mussyalovitch introduced a terrible number of polish words into his sentences and seeing that this only increased his consequence in the eye of the president and the prosecutor grew more and more pompous and ended by talking in polish altogether
trifon_borissovitch recalled was forced in spite of his evasions to admit that pan_vrublevsky had substituted another pack of cards for the one he had provided and that pan mussyalovitch had cheated during the game
but fetyukovitch caught them too in his snares pyotr_fomitch_kalganov confirmed this and both the poles left the witness box with damaged reputations amidst laughter from the public
then exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most dangerous witnesses fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on all of them and dismissing them with a certain derision
the lawyers and experts were lost in admiration and were only at a loss to understand what good purpose could be served by it for all i repeat felt that the case for the prosecution could not be refuted but was growing more and more tragically overwhelming
but from the confidence of the great magician they saw that he was serene and they waited feeling that such a man had not come from petersburg for nothing and that he was not a man to return unsuccessful
chapter iii the medical experts and a pound of nuts the evidence of the medical experts too was of little use to the prisoner
the medical line of defense had only been taken up through the insistence of katerina_ivanovna who had sent for a celebrated doctor from moscow on purpose
and it appeared later that fetyukovitch had not reckoned much upon it the case for the defense could of course lose nothing by it and might with luck gain something from it
there was however an element of comedy about it through the difference of opinion of the doctors the medical experts were the famous doctor from moscow our doctor herzenstube and the young doctor varvinsky
the two latter appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution the first to be called in the capacity of expert was doctor herzenstube
he was a gray and bald old man of seventy of middle height and sturdy build he was much esteemed and respected by every one in the town
he was a conscientious doctor and an excellent and pious man a hernguter or moravian brother i am not quite sure which
he had been living amongst us for many years and behaved with wonderful dignity he was a kind hearted and humane man
he treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing visited them in their slums and huts and left money for medicine but he was as obstinate as a mule
almost every one in the town was aware by the way that the famous doctor had within the first two or three day of his presence among us uttered some extremely offensive allusions to doctor herzenstube qualifications
though the moscow doctor asked twenty five roubles for a visit several people in the town were glad to take advantage of his arrival and rushed to consult him regardless of expense
all these had of course been previously patients of doctor herzenstube and the celebrated doctor had criticized his treatment with extreme harshness
if once he had taken an idea into his head there was no shaking it finally he had asked the patients as soon as he saw them well who has been cramming you with nostrums
doctor herzenstube of course heard all this and now all the three doctors made their appearance one after another to be examined
then giving his grounds for this opinion which i omit here he added that the abnormality was not only evident in many of the prisoner actions in the past but was apparent even now at this very moment
when he was asked to explain how it was apparent now at this moment the old doctor with simple hearted directness pointed out that the prisoner on entering the court had an extraordinary air remarkable in the circumstances that he had marched in like a soldier looking straight before him though it would have been more natural for him to look to the left where among the public the lady were sitting seeing that he was a great admirer of the fair sex and must be thinking much of what the lady are saying of him now the old man concluded in his peculiar language
i must add that he spoke russian readily but every phrase was formed in german style which did not however trouble him for it had always been a weakness of his to believe that he spoke russian perfectly better indeed than russians
and he was very fond of using russian proverbs always declaring that the russian proverbs were the best and most expressive sayings in the whole world
i may remark too that in conversation through absent mindedness he often forgot the most ordinary words which sometimes went out of his head though he knew them perfectly
the same thing happened though when he spoke german and at such time he always waved his hand before his face as though trying to catch the lost word and no one could induce him to go on speaking till he had found the missing word
his remark that the prisoner ought to have looked at the lady on entering roused a whisper of amusement in the audience
all our lady were very fond of our old doctor they knew too that having been all his life a bachelor and a religious man of exemplary conduct he looked upon women as lofty creatures
herzenstube he he doctor herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the prisoner mental faculties was self evident and so his unexpected observation struck every one as very queer
the moscow doctor being questioned in his turn definitely and emphatically repeated that he considered the prisoner mental condition abnormal in the highest degree
he talked at length and with erudition of aberration and mania and argued that from all the facts collected the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition of aberration for several day before his arrest and if the crime had been committed by him it must even if he were conscious of it have been almost involuntary as he had not the power to control the morbid impulse that possessed him
but apart from temporary aberration the doctor diagnosed mania which premised in his words to lead to complete insanity in the future
it must be noted that i report this in my own words the doctor made use of very learned and professional language
not to refer to what i have not seen that is the crime itself and the whole catastrophe the day before yesterday while he was talking to me he had an unaccountably fixed look in his eye
all his actions are in contravention of common sense and logic he continued he laughed unexpectedly when there was nothing to laugh at
but the doctor detected mania above all in the fact that the prisoner could not even speak of the three thousand roubles of which he considered himself to have been cheated without extraordinary irritation though he could speak comparatively lightly of other misfortunes and grievances
according to all accounts he had even in the past whenever the subject of the three thousand roubles was touched on flown into a perfect frenzy and yet he was reported to be a disinterested and not grasping man
as to the opinion of my learned colleague the moscow doctor added ironically in conclusion that the prisoner would on entering the court have naturally looked at the lady and not straight before him i will only say that apart from the playfulness of this theory it is radically unsound
for though i fully agree that the prisoner on entering the court where his fate will be decided would not naturally look straight before him in that fixed way and that that may really be a sign of his abnormal mental condition at the same time i maintain that he would naturally not look to the left at the lady but on the contrary to the right to find his legal adviser on whose help all his hopes rest and on whose defense all his future depends
he showed continual and inexplicable irritability using strange words karl_bernard ethics and others equally inappropriate the doctor expressed his opinion positively and emphatically
but the unexpected pronouncement of doctor varvinsky gave the last touch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts
in his opinion the prisoner was now and had been all along in a perfectly normal condition and although he certainly must have been in a nervous and exceedingly excited state before his arrest this might have been due to several perfectly obvious causes jealousy anger continual drunkenness and so on
as to the question whether the prisoner should have looked to the left or to the right on entering the court in his modest opinion the prisoner would naturally look straight before him on entering the court as he had in fact done as that was where the judges on whom his fate depended were sitting
so that it was just by looking straight before him that he showed his perfectly normal state of mind at the present
but this nervous condition would not involve the mental aberration of which mention had just been made the young doctor concluded his modest testimony with some heat
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov of course was checked but the young doctor opinion had a decisive influence on the judges and on the public and as appeared afterwards every one agreed with him
bravo doctor cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov from his seat just so but doctor herzenstube when called as a witness was quite unexpectedly of use to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
as an old resident in the town who had known the alyosha_karamazov family for years he furnished some facts of great value for the prosecution and suddenly as though recalling something he added but the poor young man might have had a very different life for he had a good heart both in childhood and after childhood that i know
but the russian proverb says if a man has one head it good but if another clever man comes to visit him it would be better still for then there will be two heads and not only one
he knew the old man habit of talking slowly and deliberately regardless of the impression he was making and of the delay he was causing and highly prizing his flat dull and always gleefully complacent german wit
one head is good but two are better the prosecutor put in impatiently the old man was fond of making jokes
one head is good but two are much better but he did not meet another head with wits and his wits went
oh yes that what i say he went on stubbornly where did they go i ve forgotten the word
he went on passing his hand before his eye oh yes spazieren wandering oh yes wandering that what i say
well his wits went wandering and fell in such a deep hole that he lost himself and yet he was a grateful and sensitive boy
oh i remember him very well a little chap so high left neglected by his father_zossima in the back yard when he ran about without boots on his feet and his little breeches hanging by one button
a note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest old man voice fetyukovitch positively started as though scenting something and caught at it instantly
oh yes i was a young man then i was well i was forty five then and had only just come here
and i was so sorry for the boy then i asked myself why shouldnt i buy him a pound of a pound of what
i ve forgotten what it called a pound of what child are very fond of what is it what is it
the doctor began waving his hands again it grows on a tree and is gathered and given to every one
apples oh no no you have a dozen of apples not a pound no there are a lot of them and all little
you put them in the mouth and crack nuts quite so nuts i say so the doctor repeated in the calmest way as though he had been at no loss for a word
and i bought him a pound of nuts for no one had ever bought the boy a pound of nuts before
and i lifted my finger and said to him boy gott_der_sohn der vater he laughed and said gott_der_sohn der vater gott_der_sohn der von_sohn
he laughed again and lisped gott_der_sohn der von_sohn gott_der_sohn der heilige geist then he laughed and said as best he could gott_der_sohn der heilige geist
i went away and two day after i happened to be passing and he shouted to me of himself uncle gott_der_sohn der vater gott_der_sohn der von_sohn and he had only forgotten gott_der_sohn der heilige geist
but i reminded him of it and i felt very sorry for him again but he was taken away and i did not see him again
i am sitting one morning in my study a white haired old man when there walks into the room a blooming young man whom i should never have recognized but he held up his finger and said laughing gott_der_sohn der vater gott_der_sohn der von_sohn and gott_der_sohn der heilige geist
i have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts for no one else ever bought me a pound of nuts you are the only one that ever did
and then i remembered my happy youth and the poor child in the yard without boots on his feet and my heart was touched and i said you are a grateful young man for you have remembered all your life the pound of nuts i bought you in your childhood
twenty three years passed and i embraced him and blessed him and i shed tears he laughed but he shed tears too for the russian often laughs when he ought to be weeping
but he did weep i saw it and now alas and i am weeping now german i am weeping now too you saintly man mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried suddenly
in any case the anecdote made a certain favorable impression on the public but the chief sensation in mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov favor was created by the evidence of katerina_ivanovna which i will describe directly
indeed when the witnesses décharge that is called by the defense began giving evidence fortune seemed all at once markedly more favorable to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and what was particularly striking this was a surprise even to the counsel for the defense
but before katerina_ivanovna was called alyosha_karamazov was examined and he recalled a fact which seemed to furnish positive evidence against one important point made by the prosecution
chapter iv fortune smiles on mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov it came quite as a surprise even to alyosha_karamazov himself he was not required to take the oath and i remember that both sides addressed him very gently and sympathetically
it was evident that his reputation for goodness had preceded him alyosha_karamazov gave his evidence modestly and with restraint but his warm sympathy for his unhappy brother was unmistakable
in answer to one question he sketched his brother character as that of a man violent tempered perhaps and carried away by his passions but at the same time honorable proud and generous capable of self sacrifice if necessary
he admitted however that through his passion for grushenka and his rivalry with his father_zossima his brother had been of late in an intolerable position
but he repelled with indignation the suggestion that his brother might have committed a murder for the sake of gain though he recognized that the three thousand roubles had become almost an obsession with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that he looked upon them as part of the inheritance he had been cheated of by his father_zossima and that indifferent as he was to money as a rule he could not even speak of that three thousand without fury
as for the rivalry of the two lady as the prosecutor expressed it that is of grushenka and katya he answered evasively and was even unwilling to answer one or two questions altogether
did your brother tell you anyway that he intended to kill your father_zossima asked the prosecutor you can refuse to answer if you think necessary he added
he spoke to me once of his hatred for our father_zossima and his fear that at an extreme moment at a moment of fury he might perhaps murder him
he did not tell me so directly answered alyosha_karamazov how so did he indirectly and you believed him
but i never doubted that some higher feeling would always save him at the fatal moment as it has indeed saved him for it was not he killed my father_zossima alyosha_karamazov said firmly in a loud voice that was heard throughout the court
let me assure you that i fully believe in the complete sincerity of your conviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your affection for your unhappy brother
i am afraid to say that i did the prosecutor started like a war horse at the sound of a trumpet your peculiar view of the whole tragic episode is known to us already from the preliminary investigation
i wont attempt to conceal from you that it is highly individual and contradicts all the other evidence collected by the prosecution
and so i think it essential to press you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your brother innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom you gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry
i only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry replied alyosha_karamazov slowly and calmly i made no accusation against smerdyakov of myself
yet you gave evidence against him i was led to do so by my brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov words i was told what took place at his arrest and how he had pointed to smerdyakov before i was examined
i believe absolutely that my brother is innocent and if he didnt commit the murder then then smerdyakov why smerdyakov and why are you so completely persuaded of your brother innocence
i cannot help believing my brother i know he wouldnt lie to me i saw from his face he wasnt lying
only from his face is that all the proof you have i have no other proof and of smerdyakov guilt you have no proof
whatever but your brother word and the expression of his face no i have no other proof the prosecutor dropped the examination at this point
there had been talk about smerdyakov before the trial some one had heard something some one had pointed out something else it was said that alyosha_karamazov had gathered together some extraordinary proofs of his brother innocence and smerdyakov guilt and after all there was nothing no evidence except certain moral convictions so natural in a brother
on his asking alyosha_karamazov when it was that the prisoner had told him of his hatred for his father_zossima and that he might kill him and whether he had heard it for instance at their last meeting before the catastrophe alyosha_karamazov started as he answered as though only just recollecting and understanding something
the impression left by alyosha_karamazov evidence on the public was most disappointing but fetyukovitch began his cross examination i remember one circumstance now which i quite forgotten myself
and obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea he recounted eagerly how at his last interview with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that evening under the tree on the road to the monastery mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had struck himself on the breast the upper part of the breast and had repeated several time that he had a means of regaining his honor that that means was here here on his breast
i thought when he struck himself on the breast he meant that it was in his heart alyosha_karamazov continued that he might find in his heart strength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting him and which he did not dare confess even to me
i must confess i did think at the time that he was speaking of our father_zossima and that the disgrace he was shuddering at was the thought of going to our father_zossima and doing some violence to him
yet it was just then that he pointed to something on his breast so that i remember the idea struck me at the time that the heart is not on that part of the breast but below and that he struck himself much too high just below the neck and kept pointing to that place
my idea seemed silly to me at the time but he was perhaps pointing then to that little bag in which he had fifteen hundred roubles
it wasnt clear to me at the time but now just so mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried from his place that right alyosha_karamazov it was the little bag i struck with my fist
fetyukovitch flew to him in hot haste entreating him to keep quiet and at the same instant pounced on alyosha_karamazov
alyosha_karamazov carried away himself by his recollection warmly expressed his theory that this disgrace was probably just that fifteen hundred roubles on him which he might have returned to katerina_ivanovna as half of what he owed her but which he had yet determined not to repay her and to use for another purpose namely to enable him to elope with grushenka if she consented
my brother cried several time that half of the disgrace half of it he said half several time he could free himself from at once but that he was so unhappy in his weakness of will that he wouldnt do it that he knew beforehand he was incapable of doing it
it is so it must be so exclaimed alyosha_karamazov in sudden excitement and you clearly confidently remember that he struck himself just on this part of the breast
clearly and confidently for i thought at the time why does he strike himself up there when the heart is lower down
fetyukovitch asked eagerly and the thought seemed stupid to me at the time i remember its seeming stupid it flashed through my mind
it was that little bag he meant when he said he had the means but wouldnt give back that fifteen hundred
that what brought it back to me just now how could i have forgotten it till now and when he was arrested at mokroe he cried out
i know i was told it that he considered it the most disgraceful act of his life that when he had the means of repaying katerina_ivanovna half half note
what he owed her he yet could not bring himself to repay the money and preferred to remain a thief in her eye rather than part with it
he asked alyosha_karamazov to describe once more how it had all happened and several time insisted on the question had the prisoner seemed to point to anything
and what torture what torture that debt has been to him alyosha_karamazov exclaimed in conclusion the prosecutor of course intervened perhaps he had simply struck himself with his fist on the breast
but it was not with his fist cried alyosha_karamazov he pointed with his fingers and pointed here very high up
how could i have so completely forgotten it till this moment the president asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov what he had to say to the last witness evidence
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov confirmed it saying that he had been pointing to the fifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast just below the neck and that that was of course the disgrace a disgrace i cannot deny the most shameful act of my whole life cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
i might have repaid it and didnt repay it i preferred to remain a thief in her eye rather than give it back
and the most shameful part of it was that i knew beforehand i shouldnt give it back you are right alyosha_karamazov
what was important and striking about it was that one fact at least had been found and even though this were only one tiny bit of evidence a mere hint at evidence it did go some little way towards proving that the bag had existed and had contained fifteen hundred roubles and that the prisoner had not been lying at the preliminary inquiry when he alleged at mokroe that those fifteen hundred roubles were his own
thanks alyosha_karamazov so alyosha_karamazov cross examination ended alyosha_karamazov was glad with a flushed face he moved away to the seat assigned to him
he kept repeating to himself how was it i forgot how could i have forgotten it and what made it come back to me now
katerina_ivanovna was called to the witness box as she entered something extraordinary happened in the court the lady clutched their lorgnettes and opera glasses
there was a stir among the man some stood up to get a better view everybody alleged afterwards that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had turned white as a sheet on her entrance
it was impossible to tell from her face that she was agitated but there was a resolute gleam in her dark and gloomy eye
all in black she advanced modestly almost timidly i may remark that many people mentioned that she looked particularly handsome at that moment
she spoke softly but clearly so that she was heard all over the court she expressed herself with composure or at least tried to appear composed
the president began his examination discreetly and very respectfully as though afraid to touch on certain chords and showing consideration for her great unhappiness
but in answer to one of the first questions katerina_ivanovna replied firmly that she had been formerly betrothed to the prisoner until he left me of his own accord she added quietly
when they asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to post to her relations she said firmly i didnt give him the money simply to send it off
i gave him the three thousand on the understanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to
i felt at the time that he was in great need of money there was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards
i will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in detail i will only give the substance of her evidence
i was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he got money from his father_zossima she went on
he felt quite certain that he would receive the money from his father_zossima and spoke to me several time about it
i knew he had a feud with his father_zossima and have always believed that he had been unfairly treated by his father_zossima
i have never doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty his scrupulous honesty in money matters i dont remember any threat uttered by him against his father_zossima
if he had come to me at that time i should have at once relieved his anxiety about that unlucky three thousand roubles but he had given up coming to see me and i myself was put in such a position that i could not invite him
and i had no right indeed to be exacting as to that money she added suddenly and there was a ring of resolution in her voice
i was once indebted to him for assistance in money for more than three thousand and i took it although i could not at that time foresee that i should ever be in a position to repay my debt
he certainly never uttered any such threat before me there was a note of defiance in her voice it was then
fetyukovitch began his cross examination did that take place not here but at the beginning of your acquaintance fetyukovitch suggested cautiously feeling his way instantly scenting something favorable
i must mention in parenthesis that though fetyukovitch had been brought from petersburg partly at the instance of katerina_ivanovna herself he knew nothing about the episode of the four thousand roubles given her by mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and of her bowing to the ground to him
it may be pretty certainly assumed that she herself did not know till the very last minute whether she would speak of that episode in the court and waited for the inspiration of the moment
she concealed this from him and said nothing about it and that was strange no i can never forget those moments
she began telling her story she told everything the whole episode that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had told alyosha_karamazov and her bowing to the ground and her reason
she told about her father_zossima and her going to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and did not in one word in a single hint suggest that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had himself through her sister proposed they should send him katerina_ivanovna to fetch the money
she generously concealed that and was not ashamed to make it appear as though she had of her own impulse run to the young officer relying on something to beg him for the money
it was something tremendous i turned cold and trembled as i listened the court was hushed trying to catch each word
even from such a self willed and contemptuously proud girl as she was such an extremely frank avowal such sacrifice such self immolation seemed incredible
to save the man who had deceived and insulted her and to help in however small a degree in saving him by creating a strong impression in his favor
and indeed the figure of the young officer who with a respectful bow to the innocent girl handed her his last four thousand roubles all he had in the world was thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light but
it was something unexampled and for what for whom i had a painful misgiving at heart i felt that calumny might come of it later and it did in fact it did
it was repeated all over the town afterwards with spiteful laughter that the story was perhaps not quite complete that is in the statement that the officer had let the young lady depart with nothing but a respectful bow
and even if nothing had been omitted if this were the whole story the most highly respected of our lady maintained even then it very doubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl to behave in that way even for the sake of saving her father_zossima
it was hinted that something was here omitted and can katerina_ivanovna with her intelligence her morbid sensitiveness have failed to understand that people would talk like that
of course all these nasty little suspicions as to the truth of her story only arose afterwards and at the first moment all were deeply impressed by it
she must have understood it yet she made up her mind to tell everything as for the judges and the lawyers they listened in reverent almost shame faced silence to katerina_ivanovna
the prosecutor did not venture upon even one question on the subject fetyukovitch made a low bow to her oh he was almost triumphant
for a man to give his last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the same man to murder his father_zossima for the sake of robbing him of three thousand the idea seemed too incongruous
much ground had been gained fetyukovitch felt that now the charge of theft at least was as good as disproved
as for him i was told that once or twice while katerina_ivanovna was giving her evidence he jumped up from his seat sank back again and hid his face in his hands
but when she had finished he suddenly cried in a sobbing voice katya why have you ruined me and his sobs were audible all over the court
the case was thrown into quite a different light there was a wave of sympathy for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov but he instantly restrained himself and cried again now i am condemned
then he sat rigid in his place with his teeth clenched and his arms across his chest katerina_ivanovna remained in the court and sat down in her place
those who were sitting near her declared that for a long time she shivered all over as though in a fever
she was pale and sat with her eye cast down grushenka was called i am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the final cause of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov ruin
for i am convinced so is every one all the lawyers said the same afterwards that if the episode had not occurred the prisoner would at least have been recommended to mercy
but of that later a few words first about grushenka she too was dressed entirely in black with her magnificent black shawl on her shoulders
she walked to the witness box with her smooth noiseless tread with the slightly swaying gait common in women of full figure
she looked steadily at the president turning her eye neither to the right nor to the left to my thinking she looked very handsome at that moment and not at all pale as the lady alleged afterwards
they declared too that she had a concentrated and spiteful expression i believe that she was simply irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous and inquisitive eye of our scandal loving public
she was proud and could not stand contempt she was one of those people who flare up angry and eager to retaliate at the mere suggestion of contempt
there was an element of timidity too of course and inward shame at her own timidity so it was not strange that her tone kept changing
sometimes she spoke as though she were taking a desperate plunge as though she felt i dont care what happens i ll say it
at one moment it was angry contemptuous and rough and at another there was a sincere note of self condemnation
apropos of her acquaintance with fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov she remarked curtly that all nonsense and was it my fault that he would pester me
but a minute later she added it was all my fault i was laughing at them both at the old man and at him too and i brought both of them to this
it was all on account of me it happened mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov name came up somehow that nobody business she snapped at once with a sort of insolent defiance
he was my benefactor he took me when i hadnt a shoe to my foot when my family had turned me out
the president reminded her though very politely that she must answer the questions directly without going off into irrelevant details
the envelope with the notes in it she had not seen but had only heard from that wicked wretch that fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov had an envelope with notes for three thousand in it
grushenka crimsoned and her eye flashed but that was all foolishness i was only laughing i wouldnt have gone to him for anything
to whom are you referring as that wicked wretch inquired the prosecutor the lackey smerdyakov who murdered his master and hanged himself last night
she was of course at once asked what ground she had for such a definite accusation but it appeared that she too had no grounds for it
the woman who came between us has ruined him she is the cause of it all let me tell you grushenka added
dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov told me so himself you can believe him she seemed to be quivering with hatred and there was a vindictive note in her voice
she was again asked to whom she was referring the young lady katerina_ivanovna there she sent for me offered me chocolate tried to fascinate me
there not much true shame about her i can tell you that at this point the president checked her sternly begging her to moderate her language
when the prisoner was arrested at mokroe the prosecutor asked every one saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry out it all my fault
but the jealous woman heart was burning and she did not care what she did we ll go to siberia together
so you already believed him to have murdered his father_zossima i dont remember what i felt at the time answered grushenka
every one was crying out that he had killed his father_zossima and i felt that it was my fault that it was on my account he had murdered him
but when he said he wasnt guilty i believed him at once and i believe him now and always shall believe him
i remember that among other things he asked about mr_rakitin and the twenty five roubles you paid him for bringing alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov to see you
he is not the man to tell a lie fetyukovitch began his cross examination there was nothing strange about his taking the money sneered grushenka with angry contempt
he was always coming to me for money he used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me chiefly for luxuries he had enough to keep him without my help
what led you to be so liberal to mr_rakitin fetyukovitch asked in spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the president
why he is my cousin his mother was my mother sister but he always besought me not to tell any one here of it he is so dreadfully ashamed of me
this fact was a complete surprise to every one no one in the town nor in the monastery not even mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov knew of it
grushenka had somehow heard before she came into the court that he had given evidence against mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov and so she was angry
the whole effect on the public of mr_rakitin speech of his noble sentiments of his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder of russia was this time finally ruined
i was told that mr_rakitin turned purple with shame where he sat fetyukovitch was satisfied it was another godsend grushenka cross examination did not last long and of course there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence
she left a very disagreeable impression on the public hundreds of contemptuous eye were fixed upon her as she finished giving her evidence and sat down again in the court at a good distance from katerina_ivanovna
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was silent throughout her evidence he sat as though turned to stone with his eye fixed on the ground ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was called to give evidence
but the usher of the court announced to the president that owing to an attack of illness or some sort of fit the witness could not appear at the moment but was ready to give his evidence as soon as he recovered
chapter a sudden catastrophe i may note that he had been called before alyosha_karamazov but no one seemed to have heard it and it only came out later
his entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed the principal witnesses especially the two rival lady had already been questioned
several more witnesses were still to be heard who probably had little information to give after all that had been given
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov walked up with extraordinary slowness looking at no one and with his head bowed as though plunged in gloomy thought
he was irreproachably dressed but his face made a painful impression on me at least there was an earthy look in it a look like a dying man
curiosity was satisfied for the time the public was feeling almost fatigued time was passing his eye were lusterless he raised them and looked slowly round the court
the president began by informing him that he was a witness not on oath that he might answer or refuse to answer but that of course he must bear witness according to his conscience and so on and so on
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov listened and looked at him blankly but his face gradually relaxed into a smile and as soon as the president looking at him in astonishment finished he laughed outright
alyosha_karamazov jumped up from his seat and moaned ah i remember that but it was hardly noticed well and what else
he asked in a loud voice there was a hush in the court there was a feeling of something strange
the president showed signs of uneasiness you are perhaps still unwell he began looking everywhere for the usher
dont trouble yourself your excellency i am well enough and can tell you something interesting ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov answered with sudden calmness and respectfulness
you have some special communication to make the president went on still mistrustfully ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov looked down waited a few second and raising his head answered almost stammering no
he answered as it were reluctantly with extreme brevity with a sort of disgust which grew more and more marked though he answered rationally
i havent i have nothing particular they began asking him questions to many questions he answered that he did not know
he knew nothing of his father_zossima money relations with dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov i wasnt interested in the subject he added threats to murder his father_zossima he had heard from the prisoner
of the money in the envelope he had heard from smerdyakov the same thing over and over again he interrupted suddenly with a look of weariness
i have nothing particular to tell the court i see you are unwell and understand your feeling the president began
he turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to invite them to examine the witness if necessary when ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly asked in an exhausted voice
let me go your excellency i feel very ill and with these words without waiting for permission he turned to walk out of the court
but after taking four steps he stood still as though he had reached a decision smiled slowly and went back
i am like the peasant girl your excellency you know how does it go i ll stand up if i like and i wont if i dont
they were trying to put on her sarafan to take her to church_of_christ to be married and she said i ll stand up if i like and i wont if i dont
it in some book about the peasantry what do you mean by that the president asked severely why this ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov suddenly pulled out a roll of notes
he nodded towards the table on which lay the material evidence for the sake of which our father_zossima was murdered
here the money the notes that lay in that envelope where shall i put them mr superintendent take them
the usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the president how could this money have come into your possession if it is the same money
the president asked wonderingly i got them from smerdyakov from the murderer yesterday i was with him just before he hanged himself
it was he not my brother killed our father_zossima he murdered him and i incited him to do it who doesnt desire his father_zossima death
are you in your right mind broke involuntarily from the president i should think i am in my right mind
in the same nasty mind as all of you as all these ugly faces he turned suddenly to the audience
my father_zossima has been murdered and they pretend they are horrified he snarled with furious contempt they keep up the sham with one another
liars they all desire the death of their fathers one reptile devours another if there hadnt been a murder they have been angry and gone home ill humored
it a spectacle they want panem et circenses though i am one to talk have you any water give me a drink for church_of_christ sake
he suddenly clutched his head the usher at once approached him alyosha_karamazov jumped up and cried he is ill dont believe him he has brain fever
katerina_ivanovna rose impulsively from her seat and rigid with horror gazed at ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stood up and greedily looked at his brother and listened to him with a wild strange smile
dont disturb yourselves i am not mad i am only a murderer ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov began again you cant expect eloquence from a murderer he added suddenly for some reason and laughed a queer laugh
the prosecutor bent over to the president in obvious dismay the two other judges communicated in agitated whispers fetyukovitch pricked up his ears as he listened the hall was hushed in expectation
the president seemed suddenly to recollect himself witness your words are incomprehensible and impossible here calm yourself if you can and tell your story if you really have something to tell
how can you confirm your statement if indeed you are not delirious that just it i have no proof
that cur smerdyakov wont send you proofs from the other world in an envelope you think of nothing but envelopes one is enough
i ve no witnesses except one perhaps he smiled thoughtfully who is your witness he has a tail your excellency and that would be irregular
le diable existe point dont pay attention he is a paltry pitiful devil he added suddenly he ceased laughing and spoke as it were confidentially
he is here somewhere no doubt under that table with the material evidence on it perhaps where should he sit if not there
you see listen to me i told him i dont want to keep quiet and he talked about the geological cataclysm idiocy
it like a drunken man in the street bawling how vanka went to petersburg and i would give a quadrillion quadrillions for two second of joy
come release the monster he been singing a hymn that because his heart is light you dont know me oh how stupid all this business is
come take me instead of him i didnt come for nothing why why is everything so stupid and he began slowly and as it were reflectively looking round him again
but the court was all excitement by now alyosha_karamazov rushed towards him but the court usher had already seized ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov by the arm
he cried staring into the man face and suddenly seizing him by the shoulders he flung him violently to the floor
what are you about but the police were on the spot and he was seized he screamed furiously and all the time he was being removed he yelled and screamed something incoherent
the whole court was thrown into confusion i dont remember everything as it happened i was excited myself and could not follow
i only know that afterwards when everything was quiet again and every one understood what had happened the court usher came in for a reprimand though he very reasonably explained that the witness had been quite well that the doctor had seen him an hour ago when he had a slight attack of giddiness but that until he had come into the court he had talked quite consecutively so that nothing could have been foreseen that he had in fact insisted on giving evidence
but before every one had completely regained their composure and recovered from this scene it was followed by another katerina_ivanovna had an attack of hysterics
she sobbed shrieking loudly but refused to leave the court struggled and besought them not to remove her suddenly she cried to the president
there is more evidence i must give at once at once here is a document a letter take it read it quickly quickly
it a letter from that monster that man there there she pointed to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov it was he killed his father_zossima you will see that directly
he wrote to me how he would kill his father_zossima but the other one is ill he is ill he is delirious
the court usher took the document she held out to the president and she dropping into her chair hiding her face in her hands began convulsively and noiselessly sobbing shaking all over and stifling every sound for fear she should be ejected from the court
the document she had handed up was that letter mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had written at the metropolis tavern which ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had spoken of as a mathematical proof
its mathematical conclusiveness was recognized and had it not been for that letter mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov might have escaped his doom or at least that doom would have been less terrible
she kept crying out beside herself alas it was i repeat difficult to notice every detail what followed is still confused to my mind
the president must i suppose have at once passed on the document to the judges the jury and the lawyers on both sides
on being gently asked by the president whether she had recovered sufficiently katerina_ivanovna exclaimed impetuously i am ready i am ready
i am quite equal to answering you she added evidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented from giving evidence
i only remember how they began examining the witness she was asked to explain in detail what this letter was and under what circumstances she received it
i received it the day before the crime was committed but he wrote it the day before that at the tavern that is two day before he committed the crime
he hated me at that time because he had behaved contemptibly and was running after that creature and because he owed me that three thousand
look it is written on some sort of bill she cried breathlessly oh he was humiliated by that three thousand on account of his own meanness
this is how it happened about that three thousand i beg you i beseech you to hear me three weeks before he murdered his father_zossima he came to me one morning
i knew he was in want of money and what he wanted it for yes yes to win that creature and carry her off
i knew then that he had been false to me and meant to abandon me and it was i i who gave him that money who offered it to him on the pretext of his sending it to my sister in moscow
and as i gave it him i looked him in the face and said that he could send it when he liked in a month time would do
how how could he have failed to understand that i was practically telling him to his face you want money to be false to me with your creature so here the money for you
i give it to you myself take it if you have so little honor as to take it i wanted to prove what he was and what happened
he took it he took it and squandered it with that creature in one night but he knew he knew that i knew all about it
i assure you he understood too that i gave him that money to test him to see whether he was so lost to all sense of honor as to take it from me
i looked into his eye and he looked into mine and he understood it all and he took it he carried off my money
that true katya mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov roared suddenly i looked into your eye and i knew that you were dishonoring me and yet i took your money
despise me as a scoundrel despise me all of you i ve deserved it prisoner cried the president another word and i will order you to be removed
that money was a torment to him katya went on with impulsive haste he wanted to repay it me
so he murdered his father_zossima but he didnt repay me and went off with her to that village where he was arrested
he wanted to that true but he needed money for that creature too there again he squandered the money he had stolen after the murder of his father_zossima
and a day before the murder he wrote me this letter he was drunk when he wrote it i saw it at once at the time
he wrote it from spite and feeling certain positively certain that i should never show it to any one even if he did kill him or else he wouldnt have written it
but read it read it attentively more attentively please and you will see that he had described it all in his letter all beforehand how he would kill his father_zossima and where his money was kept
for he knew i shouldnt want to revenge myself and ruin him look please dont overlook that there one phrase there i shall kill him as soon as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has gone away
so he thought it all out beforehand how he would kill him katerina_ivanovna pointed out to the court with venomous and malignant triumph
if he hadnt been drunk he wouldnt have written to me but look everything is written there beforehand just as he committed the murder after
oh it was clear she had studied every line of that letter and detected every meaning underlining it a complete program of it
she was reckless now of all consequences to herself though no doubt she had foreseen them even a month ago for even then perhaps shaking with anger she had pondered whether to show it at the trial or not
she exclaimed frantically now she had taken the fatal plunge i remember that the letter was read aloud by the clerk directly afterwards i believe
it made an overwhelming impression they asked mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov whether he admitted having written the letter it mine mine cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
we ve hated each other for many things katya but i swear i swear i loved you even while i hated you and you didnt love me
i shouldnt have written it if i hadnt been drunk he sank back on his seat wringing his hands in despair
the prosecutor and counsel for the defense began cross examining her chiefly to ascertain what had induced her to conceal such a document and to give her evidence in quite a different tone and spirit just before
i was lying against my honor and my conscience but i wanted to save him for he has hated and despised me so
oh he has despised me horribly he has always despised me and do you know he has despised me from the very moment that i bowed down to him for that money
yes yes i was telling lies just now katya cried madly i saw that i felt it at once at the time but for a long time i wouldnt believe it
oh he didnt understand he had no idea why i ran to him he can suspect nothing but baseness he judged me by himself he thought every one was like himself
how often i have read it in his eye you came of yourself though katya hissed furiously in a perfect frenzy
and he only wanted to marry me because i inherited a fortune because of that because of that i always suspected it was because of that
he was always convinced that i should be trembling with shame all my life before him because i went to him then and that he had a right to despise me for ever for it and so to be superior to me
oh he is a brute that why he wanted to marry me that so that all so i tried to conquer him by my love a love that knew no bounds
i even tried to forgive his faithlessness but he understood nothing nothing how could he understand indeed he is a monster
i only received that letter the next evening it was brought me from the tavern and only that morning only that morning i wanted to forgive him everything everything even his treachery
the president and the prosecutor of course tried to calm her i cant help thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage of her hysteria and of listening to such avowals
i remember hearing them say to her we understand how hard it is for you be sure we are able to feel for you and so on and so on
she described at last with extraordinary clearness which is so often seen though only for a moment in such over wrought states how ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had been nearly driven out of his mind during the last two months trying to save the monster and murderer his brother
he tortured himself she exclaimed he was always trying to minimize his brother guilt and confessing to me that he too had never loved his father_zossima and perhaps desired his death himself
and yet they dragged the evidence out of the raving hysterical woman oh he has a tender over tender conscience he tormented himself with his conscience
he told me everything everything he came every day and talked to me as his only friend i have the honor to be his only friend
she cried suddenly with a sort of defiance and her eye flashed he had been twice to see smerdyakov
one day he came to me and said if it was not my brother but smerdyakov committed the murder for the legend was circulating everywhere that smerdyakov had done it perhaps i too am guilty for smerdyakov knew i didnt like my father_zossima and perhaps believed that i desired my father_zossima death
then i brought out that letter and showed it him he was entirely convinced that his brother had done it and he was overwhelmed by it
he couldnt endure the thought that his own brother was a parricide only a week ago i saw that it was making him ill
during the last few day he has talked incoherently in my presence i saw his mind was giving way he walked about raving he was seen muttering in the streets
the doctor from moscow at my request examined him the day before yesterday and told me that he was on the eve of brain fever and all on his account on account of this monster
it was such a shock that it drove him out of his mind and all through this monster all for the sake of saving the monster
oh of course such an outpouring such an avowal is only possible once in a lifetime at the hour of death for instance on the way to the scaffold
and last night he learnt that smerdyakov was dead but it was in katya character and it was such a moment in her life
it was the same impetuous katya who had thrown herself on the mercy of a young profligate to save her father_zossima the same katya who had just before in her pride and chastity sacrificed herself and her maidenly modesty before all these people telling of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov generous conduct in the hope of softening his fate a little
and now again she sacrificed herself but this time it was for another and perhaps only now perhaps only at this moment she felt and knew how dear that other was to her
she had sacrificed herself in terror for him conceiving all of a sudden that he had ruined himself by his confession that it was he who had committed the murder not his brother she had sacrificed herself to save him to save his good name his reputation
and yet one terrible doubt occurred to one was she lying in her description of her former relations with mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov that was the question
no she had not intentionally slandered him when she cried that mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov despised her for her bowing down to him she believed it herself
she had been firmly convinced perhaps ever since that bow that the simple hearted mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov who even then adored her was laughing at her and despising her
she had loved him with an hysterical lacerated love only from pride from wounded pride and that love was not like love but more like revenge
oh perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love perhaps katya longed for nothing more than that but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov faithlessness had wounded her to the bottom of her heart and her heart could not forgive him
the moment of revenge had come upon her suddenly and all that had been accumulating so long and so painfully in the offended woman breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly
and no sooner had she given full expression to her feeling than the tension of course was over and she was overwhelmed with shame
she betrayed mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov but she betrayed herself too hysterics began again she fell on the floor sobbing and screaming she was carried out
at that moment grushenka with a wail rushed towards mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov before they had time to prevent her mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov she wailed your serpent has destroyed you
there she has shown you what she is she shouted to the judges shaking with anger at a signal from the president they seized her and tried to remove her from the court
she wouldnt allow it she fought and struggled to get back to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her
yes i think the lady who came to see the spectacle must have been satisfied the show had been a varied one
he was overpowered then i remember the moscow doctor appeared on the scene i believe the president had previously sent the court usher to arrange for medical aid for ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
the doctor announced to the court that the sick man was suffering from a dangerous attack of brain fever and that he must be at once removed
in answer to questions from the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense he said that the patient had come to him of his own accord the day before yesterday and that he had warned him that he had such an attack coming on but he had not consented to be looked after
he was certainly not in a normal state of mind he told me himself that he saw visions when he was awake that he met several person in the street who were dead and that satan visited him every evening said the doctor in conclusion
having given his evidence the celebrated doctor withdrew the letter produced by katerina_ivanovna was added to the material proofs
after some deliberation the judges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of evidence given by ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and katerina_ivanovna on the protocol
but i will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses who only repeated and confirmed what had been said before though all with their characteristic peculiarities
every one was excited every one was electrified by the late catastrophe and all were awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense impatience
i repeat all was brought together in the prosecutor speech which i shall quote immediately fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by katerina_ivanovna evidence
i believe it was just eight clock when the president returned to his seat and our prosecutor ippolit_kirillovitch began his speech
but the prosecutor was triumphant when all the evidence had been taken the court was adjourned for almost an hour chapter vi
sketches of character ippolit_kirillovitch began his speech trembling with nervousness with cold sweat on his forehead feeling hot and cold all over by turns
the prosecutor speech he described this himself afterwards he regarded this speech as his chef oeuvre the chef oeuvre of his whole life as his swan song
he died it is true nine months later of rapid consumption so that he had the right as it turned out to compare himself to a swan singing his last song
and poor ippolit_kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least some feeling for the public welfare and the eternal question lay concealed in him
he had put his whole heart and all the brain he had into that speech where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity
he genuinely believed in the prisoner guilt he was accusing him not as an official duty only and in calling for vengeance he quivered with a genuine passion for the security of society
even the lady in the audience though they remained hostile to ippolit_kirillovitch admitted that he made an extraordinary impression on them
he began in a breaking voice but it soon gained strength and filled the court to the end of his speech
but as soon as he had finished he almost fainted gentlemen of the jury began the prosecutor this case has made a stir throughout russia
but what is there to wonder at what is there so peculiarly horrifying in it for us we are so accustomed to such crimes
that what so horrible that such dark deeds have ceased to horrify us what ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it and not this or that isolated crime
what are the causes of our indifference our lukewarm attitude to such deeds to such signs of the time ominous of an unenviable future
is it our cynicism is it the premature exhaustion of intellect and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay in spite of its youth
is it that our moral principles are shattered to their foundations or is it perhaps a complete lack of such principles among us
i cannot answer such questions nevertheless they are disturbing and every citizen not only must but ought to be harassed by them
our newborn and still timid press has done good service to the public already for without it we should never have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence and moral degradation which are continually made known by the press not merely to those who attend the new jury courts established in the present reign but to every one
but what is most important is that the majority of our national crimes of violence bear witness to a widespread evil now so general among us that it is difficult to contend against it
and what do we read almost daily of things beside which the present case grows pale and seems almost commonplace
one day we see a brilliant young officer of high society at the very outset of his career in a cowardly underhand way without a pang of conscience murdering an official who had once been his benefactor and the servant girl to steal his own i u and what ready money he could find on him it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionable world and for my career in the future
next a young hero decorated for bravery kills the mother of his chief and benefactor like a highwayman and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that she loves him like a son and so will follow all his directions and take no precautions
after murdering them he puts pillows under the head of each of his victims he goes away granted that he is a monster yet i dare not say in these day that he is unique
in silence alone with his conscience he asks himself perhaps what is honor and isnt the condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice
another man will not commit the murder but will feel and think like him and is as dishonorable in soul
perhaps people will cry out against me that i am morbid hysterical that it is a monstrous slander that i am exaggerating
oh dont believe me think of me as morbid but remember my words if only a tenth if only a twentieth part of what i say is true even so it awful
look how our young people commit suicide without asking themselves hamlet question what there is beyond without a sign of such a question as though all that relates to the soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had long been erased in their minds and buried under the sands
let them say so and heavens i should be the first to rejoice if it were so look at our vice at our profligates
fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov the luckless victim in the present case was almost an innocent babe compared with many of them and yet we all knew him he lived among us
yes one day perhaps the leading intellects of russia and of europe will study the psychology of russian crime for the subject is worth it
but this study will come later at leisure when all the tragic topsy turvydom of to day is farther behind us so that it possible to examine it with more insight and more impartiality than i can do
now we are either horrified or pretend to be horrified though we really gloat over the spectacle and love strong and eccentric sensations which tickle our cynical pampered idleness
or like little child we brush the dreadful ghosts away and hide our heads in the pillow so as to return to our sports and merriment as soon as they have vanished
but we must one day begin life in sober earnest we must look at ourselves as a society it time we tried to grasp something of our social position or at least to make a beginning in that direction
a great writer of the last epoch comparing russia to a swift troika galloping to an unknown goal exclaims oh troika birdlike troika who invented thee
and adds in proud ecstasy that all the people of the world stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly galloping troika to pass
that may be they may stand aside respectfully or no but in my poor opinion the great writer ended his book in this way either in an access of childish and naďve optimism or simply in fear of the censorship of the day
for if the troika were drawn by his heroes sobakevitch nozdryov tchitchikov it could reach no rational goal whoever might be driving it
and those were the heroes of an older generation ours are worse specimens still at this point ippolit_kirillovitch speech was interrupted by applause
the applause was it true of brief duration so that the president did not think it necessary to caution the public and only looked severely in the direction of the offenders
he had been all his life unable to get a hearing and now he suddenly had an opportunity of securing the ear of all russia
the liberal significance of this simile was appreciated but ippolit_kirillovitch was encouraged he had never been applauded before what after all is this alyosha_karamazov family which has gained such an unenviable notoriety throughout russia he continued
perhaps i am exaggerating but it seems to me that certain fundamental features of the educated class of to day are reflected in this family picture only of course in miniature like the sun in a drop of water
think of that unhappy vicious unbridled old man who has met with such a melancholy end the head of a family
beginning life of noble birth but in a poor dependent position through an unexpected marriage he came into a small fortune
a petty knave a toady and buffoon of fairly good though undeveloped intelligence he was above all a moneylender who grew bolder with growing prosperity
his abject and servile characteristics disappeared his malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that remained on the spiritual side he was undeveloped while his vitality was excessive
he saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure and he brought his child up to be the same he had no feeling for his duties as a father_zossima
he ridiculed those duties he left his little child to the servants and was glad to be rid of them forgot about them completely
the old man maxim was aprčs moi le déluge he was an example of everything that is opposed to civic duty of the most complete and malignant individualism
he was content he was eager to go on living in the same way for another twenty or thirty years
the world may burn for aught i care so long as i am all right and he was all right he swindled his own son and spent his money his maternal inheritance on trying to get his mistress from him
i will speak the truth myself i can well understand what resentment he had heaped up in his son heart against him
no i dont intend to leave the prisoner defense altogether to my talented colleague from petersburg but enough enough of that unhappy old man he has paid the penalty
let us remember however that he was a father_zossima and one of the typical fathers of to day am i unjust indeed in saying that he is typical of many modern fathers
many of them only differ in not openly professing such cynicism for they are better educated more cultured but their philosophy is essentially the same as his
alas perhaps i am a pessimist but you have agreed to forgive me let us agree beforehand you need not believe me but let me speak
let me say what i have to say and remember something of my words now for the child of this father_zossima this head of a family
one of them is the prisoner before us all the rest of my speech will deal with him of the other two i will speak only cursorily
the elder is one of those modern young man of brilliant education and vigorous intellect who has lost all faith in everything
he has denied and rejected much already like his father_zossima we have all heard him he was a welcome guest in local society
he never concealed his opinions quite the contrary in fact which justifies me in speaking rather openly of him now of course not as an individual but as a member of the alyosha_karamazov family
another personage closely connected with the case died here by his own hand last night i mean an afflicted idiot formerly the servant and possibly the illegitimate son of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov smerdyakov
at the preliminary inquiry he told me with hysterical tears how the young ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity
everything in the world is lawful according to him and nothing must be forbidden in the future that is what he always taught me
i believe that idiot was driven out of his mind by this theory though of course the epileptic attacks from which he suffered and this terrible catastrophe have helped to unhinge his faculties
but he dropped one very interesting observation which would have done credit to a more intelligent observer and that is indeed why i ve mentioned it if there is one of the sons that is like fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in character it is ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
with that remark i conclude my sketch of his character feeling it indelicate to continue further oh i dont want to draw any further conclusions and croak like a raven over the young man future
we ve seen to day in this court that there are still good impulses in his young heart that family feeling has not been destroyed in him by lack of faith and cynicism which have come to him rather by inheritance than by the exercise of independent thought
oh he is a devout and modest youth who does not share his elder brother gloomy and destructive theory of life
he has sought to cling to the ideas of the people or to what goes by that name in some circles of our intellectual classes
he seems to me to have betrayed unconsciously and so early that timid despair which leads so many in our unhappy society who dread cynicism and its corrupting influences and mistakenly attribute all the mischief to european enlightenment to return to their native soil as they say to the bosom so to speak of their mother earth like frightened child yearning to fall asleep on the withered bosom of their decrepit mother and to sleep there for ever only to escape the horrors that terrify them
for my part i wish the excellent and gifted young man every success i trust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the ideas of the people may never degenerate as often happens on the moral side into gloomy mysticism and on the political into blind chauvinism two elements which are even a greater menace to russia than the premature decay due to misunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of european ideas from which his elder brother is suffering
then the third son he clung to the monastery and was within an ace of becoming a monk
two or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism and mysticism ippolit_kirillovitch had been indeed carried away by his own eloquence
all this had little to do with the case in hand to say nothing of the fact of its being somewhat vague but the sickly and consumptive man was overcome by the desire to express himself once in his life
people said afterwards that he was actuated by unworthy motives in his criticism of ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov because the latter had on one or two occasions got the better of him in argument and ippolit_kirillovitch remembering it tried now to take his revenge
but i dont know whether it was true all this was only introductory however and the speech passed to more direct consideration of the case
we have his life and his actions too before us the fatal day has come and all has been brought to the surface
while his brothers seem to stand for europeanism and the principles of the people he seems to represent russia as she is
but to return to the eldest son ippolit_kirillovitch went on he is the prisoner before us oh not all russia not all
god preserve us if it were yet here we have her our mother russia the very scent and sound of her
oh he is spontaneous he is a marvelous mingling of good and evil he is a lover of culture and schiller yet he brawls in taverns and plucks out the beards of his boon companions
what is more he can be carried off his feet positively carried off his feet by noble ideals but only if they come of themselves if they fall from heaven for him if they need not be paid for
oh he too can be good and noble but only when all goes well with him he dislikes paying for anything but is very fond of receiving and that so with him in everything
he couldnt be content with less and put no obstacle in his way and he will show that he too can be noble
he is not greedy no but he must have money a great deal of money and you will see how generously with what scorn of filthy lucre he will fling it all away in the reckless dissipation of one night
but if he has not money he will show what he is ready to do to get it when he is in great need of it
oh give him every possible good in life but all this later let us take events in their chronological order
first we have before us a poor abandoned child running about the back yard without boots on his feet as our worthy and esteemed fellow citizen of foreign origin alas
expressed it just now i repeat it again i yield to no one the defense of the criminal i am here to accuse him but to defend him also
but the boy grows up and becomes an officer for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled to one of the remote frontier towns of russia
yes i too am human i too can weigh the influence of home and childhood on the character there he led a wild life as an officer
and of course he needed money money before all things and so after prolonged disputes he came to a settlement with his father_zossima and the last six thousand was sent him
a letter is in existence in which he practically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict with his father_zossima over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand
then came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and brilliant education oh i do not venture to repeat the details you have only just heard them
the figure of the young officer frivolous and profligate doing homage to true nobility and a lofty ideal was shown in a very sympathetic light before us
honor self sacrifice were shown there and i will be silent but the other side of the medal was unexpectedly turned to us immediately after in this very court
the same lady bathed in tears of long concealed indignation alleged that he he of all man had despised her for her action which though incautious reckless perhaps was still dictated by lofty and generous motives
he he the girl betrothed looked at her with that smile of mockery which was more insufferable from him than from any one
and knowing that he had already deceived her he had deceived her believing that she was bound to endure everything from him even treachery she intentionally offered him three thousand roubles and clearly too clearly let him understand that she was offering him money to deceive her
again i will not venture to conjecture why it happened so but there were causes well will you take it or not are you so lost to shame
he looked at her saw clearly what was in her mind he admitted here before you that he understood it all appropriated that three thousand unconditionally and squandered it in two day with the new object of his affections
the first legend of the young officer sacrificing his last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity and doing reverence to virtue or this other revolting picture
as a rule between two extremes one has to find the mean but in the present case this is not true
was the dumb question in her scrutinizing eye what are we to believe then the probability is that in the first case he was genuinely noble and in the second as genuinely base
because he was of the broad alyosha_karamazov character that just what i am leading up to capable of combining the most incongruous contradictions and capable of the greatest heights and of the greatest depths
mr_rakitin the sense of their own degradation is as essential to those reckless unbridled natures as the sense of their lofty generosity
and why remember the brilliant remark made by a young observer who has seen the alyosha_karamazov family at close quarters mr and that true they need continually this unnatural mixture
two extremes at the same moment or they are miserable and dissatisfied and their existence is incomplete they are wide wide as mother russia they include everything and put up with everything
by the way gentlemen of the jury we ve just touched upon that three thousand roubles and i will venture to anticipate things a little
can you conceive that a man like that on receiving that sum and in such a way at the price of such shame such disgrace such utter degradation could have been capable that very day of setting apart half that sum that very day and sewing it up in a little bag and would have had the firmness of character to carry it about with him for a whole month afterwards in spite of every temptation and his extreme need of it
neither in drunken debauchery in taverns nor when he was flying into the country trying to get from god knows whom the money so essential to him to remove the object of his affections from being tempted by his father_zossima did he bring himself to touch that little bag
why if only to avoid abandoning his mistress to the rival of whom he was so jealous he would have been certain to have opened that bag and to have stayed at home to keep watch over her and to await the moment when she would say to him at last i am yours and to fly with her far from their fatal surroundings
the chief reason as i have just said was that when she would say i am yours take me where you will he might have the wherewithal to take her
but no he did not touch his talisman and what is the reason he gives for it but that first reason in the prisoner own words was of little weight beside the second
while i have that money on me he said i am a scoundrel not a thief for i can always go to my insulted betrothed and laying down half the sum i have fraudulently appropriated i can always say to her you see i ve squandered half your money and shown i am a weak and immoral man and if you like a scoundrel i use the prisoner own expression but though i am a scoundrel i am not a thief for if i had been a thief i shouldnt have brought you back this half of the money but should have taken it as i did the other half
this frantic but weak man who could not resist the temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at the price of such disgrace this very man suddenly develops the most stoical firmness and carries about a thousand roubles without daring to touch it
no and i venture to tell you how the real dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov would have behaved in such circumstances if he really had brought himself to put away the money
at the first temptation for instance to entertain the woman with whom he had already squandered half the money he would have unpicked his little bag and have taken out some hundred roubles for why should he have taken back precisely half the money
a marvelous explanation does that fit in at all with the character we have analyzed that is fifteen hundred roubles
he could just as well have said then that he was not a thief because he brought back fourteen hundred roubles
then another time he would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred and then a third and then a fourth and before the end of the month he would have taken the last note but one feeling that if he took back only a hundred it would answer the purpose for a thief would have stolen it all
and then he would have looked at this last note and have said to himself it really not worth while to give back one hundred let spend that too
why not fourteen hundred that how the real dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov as we know him would have behaved one cannot imagine anything more incongruous with the actual fact than this legend of the little bag
after touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning the financial relations of father_zossima and son and arguing again and again that it was utterly impossible from the facts known to determine which was in the wrong ippolit_kirillovitch passed to the evidence of the medical experts in reference to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov fixed idea about the three thousand owing him
an historical survey the medical experts have striven to convince us that the prisoner is out of his mind and in fact a maniac
i maintain that he is in his right mind and that if he had not been he would have behaved more cleverly
as for his being a maniac that i would agree with but only in one point that is his fixed idea about the three thousand
nothing could be more inconceivable but we shall return to that later chapter vii yet i think one might find a much simpler cause than his tendency to insanity
for my part i agree thoroughly with the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner mental faculties have always been normal and that he has only been irritable and exasperated
the object of the prisoner continual and violent anger was not the sum itself there was a special motive at the bottom of it
he began from the moment when the prisoner went to the young person lodgings to beat her i use his own expression the prosecutor explained but instead of beating her he remained there at her feet
that motive is jealousy here ippolit_kirillovitch described at length the prisoner fatal passion for grushenka that was the beginning of the passion
at the same time the prisoner father_zossima was captivated by the same young person a strange and fatal coincidence for they both lost their hearts to her simultaneously though both had known her before
and she inspired in both of them the most violent characteristically alyosha_karamazov passion we have her own confession i was laughing at both of them
yes the sudden desire to make a jest of them came over her and she conquered both of them at once
the old man who worshiped money at once set aside three thousand roubles as a reward for one visit from her but soon after that he would have been happy to lay his property and his name at her feet if only she would become his lawful wife
we have good evidence of this as for the prisoner the tragedy of his fate is evident it is before us
the enchantress gave the unhappy young man no hope until the last moment when he knelt before her stretching out hands that were already stained with the blood of his father_zossima and rival
send me to siberia with him i have brought him to this i am most to blame the woman herself cried in genuine remorse at the moment of his arrest
the talented young man to whom i have referred already mr_rakitin characterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms she was disillusioned early in life deceived and ruined by a betrothed who seduced and abandoned her
she was left in poverty cursed by her respectable family and taken under the protection of a wealthy old man whom she still however considers as her benefactor
but such was the young person game it was in that position that he was arrested there was perhaps much that was good in her young heart but it was embittered too early
after this sketch of her character it may well be understood that she might laugh at both of them simply from mischief from malice
after a month of hopeless love and moral degradation during which he betrayed his betrothed and appropriated money entrusted to his honor the prisoner was driven almost to frenzy almost to madness by continual jealousy and of whom
and the worst of it was that the crazy old man was alluring and enticing the object of his affection by means of that very three thousand roubles which the son looked upon as his own property part of his inheritance from his mother of which his father_zossima was cheating him
she became prudent and saved money she grew sarcastic and resentful against society his father_zossima yes i admit it was hard to bear
it was not the money but the fact that this money was used with such revolting cynicism to ruin his happiness
then the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering his father_zossima had entered the prisoner head and illustrated his theory with facts
it might well drive a man to madness at first he only talked about it in taverns he was talking about it all that month
ah he likes being always surrounded with company and he likes to tell his companions everything even his most diabolical and dangerous ideas he likes to share every thought with others and expects for some reason that those he confides in will meet him with perfect sympathy enter into all his troubles and anxieties take his part and not oppose him in anything
if not he flies into a rage and smashes up everything in the tavern then followed the anecdote about captain snegiryov
those who heard the prisoner began to think at last that he might mean more than threats and that such a frenzy might turn threats into actions
here the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the monastery the conversation with alyosha_karamazov and the horrible scene of violence when the prisoner had rushed into his father_zossima house just after dinner
i cannot positively assert the prosecutor continued that the prisoner fully intended to murder his father_zossima before that incident
yet the idea had several time presented itself to him and he had deliberated on it for that we have facts witnesses and his own words
i confess gentlemen of the jury he added that till to day i have been uncertain whether to attribute to the prisoner conscious premeditation
i was firmly convinced that he had pictured the fatal moment beforehand but had only pictured it contemplating it as a possibility
he had not definitely considered when and how he might commit the crime but i was only uncertain till to day till that fatal document was presented to the court just now
you yourselves heard that young lady exclamation it is the plan the program of the murder that is how she defined that miserable drunken letter of the unhappy prisoner
it was written two day before and so we know now for a fact that forty eight hours before the perpetration of his terrible design the prisoner swore that if he could not get money next day he would murder his father_zossima in order to take the envelope with the notes from under his pillow as soon as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had left
as soon as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had gone away you hear that so he had thought everything out weighing every circumstance and he carried it all out just as he had written it
the proof of premeditation is conclusive the crime must have been committed for the sake of the money that is stated clearly that is written and signed
and in fact from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder was premeditated the prisoner does not deny his signature
but that does not diminish the value of the letter quite the contrary he wrote when drunk what he had planned when sober
i shall be told he was drunk when he wrote it had he not planned it when sober he would not have written it when drunk
i shall be asked then why did he talk about it in taverns a man who premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it to himself
yes but he talked about it before he had formed a plan when he had only the desire only the impulse to it
on the evening he wrote that letter at the metropolis tavern contrary to his custom he was silent though he had been drinking
he did indeed turn a shopman out of his seat but that was done almost unconsciously because he could never enter a tavern without making a disturbance
it is true that after he had taken the final decision he must have felt apprehensive that he had talked too much about his design beforehand and that this might lead to his arrest and prosecution afterwards
but there was nothing for it he could not take his words back but his luck had served him before it would serve him again
afterwards he talked less about it he did not play billiards he sat in a corner talked to no one he believed in his star you know
to morrow i shall try and borrow the money from every one as he writes in his peculiar language and if they wont give it to me there will be bloodshed
i must confess too that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastrophe here ippolit_kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov efforts to borrow the money
harassed jeered at hungry after selling his watch to pay for the journey though he tells us he had fifteen hundred roubles on him a likely story tortured by jealousy at having left the object of his affections in the town suspecting that she would go to fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov in his absence he returned at last to the town to find to his joy that she had not been near his father_zossima
he described his visit to mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov his journey to lyagavy he accompanied her himself to her protector strange to say he doesnt seem to have been jealous of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov which is psychologically interesting
then he hastens back to his ambush in the back garden and there learns that smerdyakov is in a fit that the other servant is ill the coast is clear and he knows the signals what a temptation
still he resists it he goes off to a lady who has for some time been residing in the town and who is highly esteemed among us madame_hohlakov
that lady who had long watched his career with compassion gave him the most judicious advice to give up his dissipated life his unseemly love affair the waste of his youth and vigor in pot house debauchery and to set off to siberia to the gold mines that would be an outlet for your turbulent energies your romantic character your thirst for adventure
after describing the result of this conversation and the moment when the prisoner learnt that grushenka had not remained at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the sudden frenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous exhaustion at the thought that she had deceived him and was now with his father_zossima ippolit_kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence of chance
had the maid told him that her mistress was at mokroe with her former lover nothing would have happened
but she lost her head she could only swear and protest her ignorance and if the prisoner did not kill her on the spot it was only because he flew in pursuit of his false mistress
but note frantic as he was he took with him a brass pestle why that why not some other weapon
but since he had been contemplating his plan and preparing himself for it for a whole month he would snatch up anything like a weapon that caught his eye
he had realized for a month past that any object of the kind would serve as a weapon so he instantly without hesitation recognized that it would serve his purpose
so it was by no means unconsciously by no means involuntarily that he snatched up that fatal pestle and then we find him in his father_zossima garden
the suspicion that she was there with him with his rival in his arms and perhaps laughing at him at that moment took his breath away
the coast is clear there are no witnesses darkness and jealousy and it was not mere suspicion the deception was open obvious
she must be there in that lighted room she must be behind the screen and the unhappy man would have us believe that he stole up to the window peeped respectfully in and discreetly withdrew for fear something terrible and immoral should happen
and he tries to persuade us of that us who understand his character who know his state of mind at the moment and that he knew the signals by which he could at once enter the house
he did this very circumstantially and every one realized that although he professed to despise that suspicion he thought the subject of great importance
at this point ippolit_kirillovitch broke off to discuss exhaustively the suspected connection of smerdyakov with the murder chapter viii
the first person who cried out that smerdyakov had committed the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his arrest yet from that time to this he had not brought forward a single fact to confirm the charge nor the faintest suggestion of a fact
a treatise on smerdyakov to begin with what was the source of this suspicion ippolit_kirillovitch began the charge is confirmed by three person only the two brothers of the prisoner and madame_svyetlov
but we know that for the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of his brother guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea
the elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only to day when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever but of that later
the younger brother has admitted that he has not the slightest fact to support his notion of smerdyakov guilt and has only been led to that conclusion from the prisoner own words and the expression of his face
yes that astounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twice to day by him madame_svyetlov was even more astounding
that is all the evidence against smerdyakov produced by these three person who are all deeply concerned in the prisoner fate
what the prisoner tells you you must believe he is not a man to tell a lie and yet the theory of smerdyakov guilt has been noised about has been and is still maintained
here ippolit_kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the personality of smerdyakov who had cut short his life in a fit of insanity
he depicted him as a man of weak intellect with a smattering of education who had been thrown off his balance by philosophical ideas above his level and certain modern theories of duty which he learnt in practice from the reckless life of his master who was also perhaps his father_zossima fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov and theoretically from various strange philosophical conversation with his master elder son ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov who readily indulged in this diversion probably feeling dull or wishing to amuse himself at the valet expense
he spoke to me himself of his spiritual condition during the last few day at his father_zossima house ippolit_kirillovitch explained but others too have borne witness to it the prisoner himself his brother and the servant grigory_vassilyevitch that is all who knew him well
is it credible is it conceivable moreover smerdyakov whose health was shaken by his attacks of epilepsy had not the courage of a chicken
he fell at my feet and kissed them the prisoner himself has told us before he realized how damaging such a statement was to himself
and the prisoner chose him for his confidant we have his own word for it and he frightened him into consenting at last to act as a spy for him
in that capacity he deceived his master revealing to the prisoner the existence of the envelope with the notes in it and the signals by means of which he could get into the house
he is an epileptic chicken he declared about him in his characteristic language how could he help telling him indeed
he would have killed me i could see that he would have killed me he said at the inquiry trembling and shaking even before us though his tormentor was by that time arrested and could do him no harm
in fear and trembling i hastened to tell him every secret to pacify him that he might see that i had not deceived him and let me off alive
he suspected me at every instant those are his own words i wrote them down and i remember them when he began shouting at me i would fall on my knees
he was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence of his master ever since he had restored him some money he had lost
so it may be supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs of remorse at having deceived his master whom he loved as his benefactor
person severely afflicted with epilepsy are so the most skillful doctors tell us always prone to continual and morbid self reproach
they worry over their wickedness they are tormented by pangs of conscience often entirely without cause they exaggerate and often invent all sort of faults and crimes
and here we have a man of that type who had really been driven to wrong doing by terror and intimidation
he had besides a strong presentiment that something terrible would be the outcome of the situation that was developing before his eye
when ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov was leaving for moscow just before the catastrophe smerdyakov besought him to remain though he was too timid to tell him plainly what he feared
it must be observed that he looked on ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov as a protector whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm would come to pass
he confined himself to hints but his hints were not understood remember the phrase in dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov drunken letter i shall kill the old man if only ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov goes away
so ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov presence seemed to every one a guarantee of peace and order in the house but he went away and within an hour of his young master departure smerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit
here i must mention that smerdyakov oppressed by terror and despair of a sort had felt during those last few day that one of the fits from which he had suffered before at moments of strain might be coming upon him again
the day and hour of such an attack cannot of course be foreseen but every epileptic can feel beforehand that he is likely to have one
and so as soon as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had driven out of the yard smerdyakov depressed by his lonely and unprotected position went to the cellar
he went down the stairs wondering if he would have a fit or not and what if it were to come upon him at once
and that very apprehension that very wonder brought on the spasm in his throat that always precedes such attacks and he fell unconscious into the cellar
and in this perfectly natural occurrence people try to detect a suspicion a hint that he was shamming an attack on purpose
but that perfectly intelligible so the doctors tell us but if it were on purpose the question arises at once what was his motive
i say nothing about medicine science i am told may go astray the doctors were not able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the real
what was he reckoning on what was he aiming at that may be so but answer me one question what motive had he for such a counterfeit
could he had he been plotting the murder have desired to attract the attention of the household by having a fit just before
you see gentlemen of the jury on the night of the murder there were five person in fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov pavlovitch himself but he did not kill himself
that evident then his servant grigory_vassilyevitch but he was almost killed himself the third person was grigory_vassilyevitch wife marfa_ignatyevna but it would be simply shameful to imagine her murdering her master
but if we are to believe the prisoner statement that he is not the murderer then smerdyakov must have been for there is no other alternative no one else can be found
two person are left the prisoner and smerdyakov that is what accounts for the artful astounding accusation against the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday
had a shadow of suspicion rested on any one else had there been any sixth person i am persuaded that even the prisoner would have been ashamed to accuse smerdyakov and would have accused that sixth person for to charge smerdyakov with that murder is perfectly absurd
gentlemen let us lay aside psychology let us lay aside medicine let us even lay aside logic let us turn only to the facts and see what the facts tell us
if smerdyakov killed him how did he do it alone or with the assistance of the prisoner let us consider the first alternative that he did it alone
but not having a shadow of the motive that the prisoner had for the murder hatred jealousy and so on smerdyakov could only have murdered him for the sake of gain in order to appropriate the three thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope
and yet he tells another person and a person most closely interested that is the prisoner everything about the money and the signals where the envelope lay what was written on it what it was tied up with and above all told him of those signals by which he could enter the house
did he do this simply to betray himself or to invite to the same enterprise one who would be anxious to get that envelope for himself
if he had killed him it must have been with some object for some advantage to himself yes i shall be told but he betrayed it from fear
a man who could conceive such an audacious savage act and carry it out tells facts which are known to no one else in the world and which if he held his tongue no one would ever have guessed
no however cowardly he might be if he had plotted such a crime nothing would have induced him to tell any one about the envelope and the signals for that was as good as betraying himself beforehand
he would have invented something he would have told some lie if he had been forced to give information but he would have been silent about that
for on the other hand if he had said nothing about the money but had committed the murder and stolen the money no one in the world could have charged him with murder for the sake of robbery since no one but he had seen the money no one
even if he had been accused of the murder it could only have been thought that he had committed it from some other motive
but since no one had observed any such motive in him beforehand and every one saw on the contrary that his master was fond of him and honored him with his confidence he would of course have been the last to be suspected
people would have suspected first the man who had a motive a man who had himself declared he had such motives who had made no secret of it they would in fact have suspected the son of the murdered man dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
but how do you explain this but he knew of its existence in the house had smerdyakov killed and robbed him and the son been accused of it that would of course have suited smerdyakov
yet are we to believe that though plotting the murder he told that son dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov about the money the envelope and the signals
when the day of the murder planned by smerdyakov came we have him falling downstairs in a feigned fit with what object
in the first place that grigory_vassilyevitch who had been intending to take his medicine might put it off and remain on guard seeing there was no one to look after the house and in the second place i suppose that his master seeing that there was no one to guard him and in terror of a visit from his son might redouble his vigilance and precaution
and most of all i suppose that he smerdyakov disabled by the fit might be carried from the kitchen where he always slept apart from all the rest and where he could go in and out as he liked to grigory_vassilyevitch room at the other end of the lodge where he was always put shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed
is that logical is that clear this was the immemorial custom established by his master and the kind hearted marfa_ignatyevna whenever he had a fit
there lying behind the screen he would most likely to keep up the sham have begun groaning and so keeping them awake all night as grigory_vassilyevitch and his wife testified
but i shall be told that he shammed illness on purpose that he might not be suspected and that he told the prisoner of the money and the signals to tempt him to commit the murder and when he had murdered him and had gone away with the money making a noise most likely and waking people smerdyakov got up am i to believe and went in what for
and all this we are to believe that he might more conveniently get up and murder his master to murder his master a second time and carry off the money that had already been stolen
gentlemen are you laughing i am ashamed to put forward such suggestions but incredible as it seems that just what the prisoner alleges
when he had left the house had knocked grigory_vassilyevitch down and raised an alarm he tells us smerdyakov got up went in and murdered his master and stole the money
i wont press the point that smerdyakov could hardly have reckoned on this beforehand and have foreseen that the furious and exasperated son would simply come to peep in respectfully though he knew the signals and beat a retreat leaving smerdyakov his booty
gentlemen of the jury i put this question to you in earnest when was the moment when smerdyakov could have committed his crime
name that moment or you cant accuse him but perhaps the fit was a real one the sick man suddenly recovered heard a shout and went out
well what then he looked about him and said why not go and kill the master and how did he know what had happened since he had been lying unconscious till that moment
but there a limit to these flights of fancy quite so some astute people will tell me but what if they were in agreement
what if they murdered him together and shared the money what then a weighty question truly and the facts to confirm it are astounding
one commits the murder and takes all the trouble while his accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit apparently to arouse suspicion in every one alarm in his master and alarm in grigory_vassilyevitch
it would be interesting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices to form such an insane plan
but perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on smerdyakov part but only of passive acquiescence perhaps smerdyakov was intimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder and foreseeing that he would be blamed for letting his master be murdered without screaming for help or resisting he may have obtained permission from dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov to get out of the way by shamming a fit you may murder him as you like it nothing to me
but as this attack of smerdyakov was bound to throw the household into confusion dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov could never have agreed to such a plan
supposing that he did agree it would still follow that dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov is the murderer and the instigator and smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice and not even an accomplice but merely acquiesced against his will through terror
as soon as he is arrested the prisoner instantly throws all the blame on smerdyakov not accusing him of being his accomplice but of being himself the murderer
i will waive that point however but what do we see he did it alone he says he murdered and robbed him
it was the work of his hands strange sort of accomplices who begin to accuse one another at once and think of the risk for alyosha_karamazov
after committing the murder while his accomplice lay in bed he throws the blame on the invalid who might well have resented it and in self preservation might well have confessed the truth
for he might well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he was responsible and so he might well have reckoned that if he were punished it would be far less severely than the real murderer
smerdyakov never hinted at their complicity though the actual murderer persisted in accusing him and declaring that he had committed the crime alone
what more smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement that it was he who had told the prisoner of the envelope of notes and of the signals and that but for him he would have known nothing about them
but in that case he would have been certain to make a confession yet he has not done so if he had really been a guilty accomplice would he so readily have made this statement at the inquiry
on the contrary he would have tried to conceal it to distort the facts or minimize them but he was far from distorting or minimizing them
no one but an innocent man who had no fear of being charged with complicity could have acted as he did
he left a note written in his peculiar language i destroy myself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no blame on any one
and in a fit of melancholy arising from his disease and this catastrophe he hanged himself yesterday what would it have cost him to add i am the murderer not alyosha_karamazov
but that he did not add did his conscience lead him to suicide and not to avowing his guilt and what followed
notes for three thousand roubles were brought into the court just now and we were told that they were the same that lay in the envelope now on the table before us and that the witness had received them from smerdyakov the day before
but i need not recall the painful scene though i will make one or two comments selecting such trivial ones as might not be obvious at first sight to every one and so may be overlooked
in the first place smerdyakov must have given back the money and hanged himself yesterday from remorse and only yesterday he confessed his guilt to ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov as the latter informs us
and so if he has confessed then why i ask again did he not avow the whole truth in the last letter he left behind knowing that the innocent prisoner had to face this terrible ordeal the next day
if it were not so indeed why should ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov have kept silence till now the money alone is no proof
a week ago quite by chance the fact came to the knowledge of myself and two other person in this court that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had sent two five per cent
i only mention this to point out that any one may have money and that it cant be proved that these notes are the same as were in fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov envelope
coupons of five thousand each that is ten thousand in all to the chief town of the province to be changed ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov after receiving yesterday a communication of such importance from the real murderer did not stir
why didnt he report it at once why did he put it all off till morning i think i have a right to conjecture why
his health had been giving way for a week past he had admitted to a doctor and to his most intimate friends that he was suffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead he was on the eve of the attack of brain fever by which he has been stricken down to day
in this condition he suddenly heard of smerdyakov death and at once reflected the man is dead i can throw the blame on him and save my brother
i have money i will take a roll of notes and say that smerdyakov gave them me before his death you will say that was dishonorable it dishonorable to slander even the dead and even to save a brother
true but what if he slandered him unconsciously what if finally unhinged by the sudden news of the valet death he imagined it really was so
you saw the recent scene you have seen the witness condition he was standing up and was speaking but where was his mind
then followed the document the prisoner letter written two day before the crime and containing a complete program of the murder
why then are we looking for any other program the crime was committed precisely according to this program and by no other than the writer of it
he did not run respectfully and timidly away from his father_zossima window though he was firmly convinced that the object of his affections was with him
yes gentlemen of the jury it went off without a hitch no that is absurd and unlikely he went in and murdered him
but having killed him probably with one blow of the brass pestle and having convinced himself after careful search that she was not there he did not however forget to put his hand under the pillow and take out the envelope the torn cover of which lies now on the table before us
most likely he killed him in anger burning with resentment as soon as he looked on his hated rival i mention this fact that you may note one to my thinking very characteristic circumstance
had he been an experienced murderer and had he committed the murder for the sake of gain only would he have left the torn envelope on the floor as it was found beside the corpse
had it been smerdyakov for instance murdering his master to rob him he would have simply carried away the envelope with him without troubling himself to open it over his victim corpse for he would have known for certain that the notes were in the envelope they had been put in and sealed up in his presence and had he taken the envelope with him no one would ever have known of the robbery
i ask you gentlemen would smerdyakov have behaved in that way would he have left the envelope on the floor
no this was the action of a frantic murderer a murderer who was not a thief and had never stolen before that day who snatched the notes from under the pillow not like a thief stealing them but as though seizing his own property from the thief who had stolen it
and pouncing upon the envelope which he had never seen before he tore it open to make sure whether the money was in it and ran away with the money in his pocket even forgetting to consider that he had left an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelope on the floor
for that was the idea which had become almost an insane obsession in dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov in regard to that money all because it was alyosha_karamazov not smerdyakov he didnt think he didnt reflect and how should he
he ran away he heard behind him the servant cry out the old man caught him stopped him and was felled to the ground by the brass pestle
would you believe it he tells us that he leapt down out of pity out of compassion to see whether he could do anything for him
the prisoner moved by pity leapt down to look at him was that a moment to show compassion no he jumped down simply to make certain whether the only witness of his crime were dead or alive
note that he took trouble over grigory_vassilyevitch wiped his head with his handkerchief and convincing himself he was dead he ran to the house of his mistress dazed and covered with blood
any other feeling any other motive would be unnatural how was it he never thought that he was covered with blood and would be at once detected
but the prisoner himself assures us that he did not even notice that he was covered with blood that may be believed that is very possible that always happens at such moments with criminals
on one point they will show diabolical cunning while another will escape them altogether but he was thinking at that moment of one thing only where was she
he wanted to find out at once where she was so he ran to her lodging and learnt an unexpected and astounding piece of news she had gone off to mokroe to meet her first lover
ippolit_kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of exposition beloved by all nervous orators who find in its limitation a check on their own eager rhetoric
at this moment in his speech he went off into a dissertation on grushenka first lover and brought forward several interesting thoughts on this theme
alyosha_karamazov who had been frantically jealous of every one collapsed so to speak and effaced himself at once before this first lover
chapter ix the galloping troika the end of the prosecutor speech what makes it all the more strange is that he seems to have hardly thought of this formidable rival
but he had looked upon him as a remote danger and alyosha_karamazov always lives in the present possibly he regarded him as a fiction
but his wounded heart grasped instantly that the woman had been concealing this new rival and deceiving him because he was anything but a fiction to her because he was the one hope of her life
grasping this instantly he resigned himself gentlemen of the jury i cannot help dwelling on this unexpected trait in the prisoner character
he suddenly evinces an irresistible desire for justice a respect for woman and a recognition of her right to love and all this at the very moment when he had stained his hands with his father_zossima blood for her sake
it is true that the blood he had shed was already crying out for vengeance for after having ruined his soul and his life in this world he was forced to ask himself at that same instant what he was and what he could be now to her to that being dearer to him than his own soul in comparison with that former lover who had returned penitent with new love to the woman he had once betrayed with honorable offers with the promise of a reformed and happy life
alyosha_karamazov felt all this knew that all ways were barred to him by his crime and that he was a criminal under sentence and not a man with life before him
and so he instantly flew to one frantic plan which to a man of alyosha_karamazov character must have appeared the one inevitable way out of his terrible position
and he luckless man what could he give her now what could he offer her this thought crushed him that way out was suicide
he ran for the pistol he had left in pledge with his friend pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin and on the way as he ran he pulled out of his pocket the money for the sake of which he had stained his hands with his father_zossima gore
oh now he needed money more than ever alyosha_karamazov would die alyosha_karamazov would shoot himself and it should be remembered to be sure he was a poet and had burnt the candle at both ends all his life
and there oh there i will give a feast to the whole world such as never was before that will be remembered and talked of long after
in the midst of shouts of wild merriment reckless gypsy songs and dances i shall raise the glass and drink to the woman i adore and her new found happiness
to her to her and then on the spot at her feet i shall dash out my brains before her and punish myself
here we see in excess a love of effect a romantic despair and sentimentality and the wild recklessness of the karamazovs
yes but there is something else gentlemen of the jury something that cries out in the soul throbs incessantly in the mind and poisons the heart unto death that something is conscience gentlemen of the jury its judgment its terrible torments
she will remember mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov alyosha_karamazov sometimes she will see how mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov loved her she will feel for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov the pistol will settle everything the pistol is the only way out
but beyond i dont know whether alyosha_karamazov wondered at that moment what lies beyond and whether alyosha_karamazov could like hamlet wonder what lies beyond
no gentlemen of the jury they have their hamlets but we still have our karamazovs here ippolit_kirillovitch drew a minute picture of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov preparations the scene at pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin at the shop with the drivers
he quoted numerous words and actions confirmed by witnesses and the picture made a terrible impression on the audience the guilt of this harassed and desperate man stood out clear and convincing when the facts were brought together
what need had he of precaution two or three time he almost confessed hinted at it all but spoke out
then followed the evidence given by witnesses he even cried out to the peasant who drove him do you know you are driving a murderer
but it was impossible for him to speak out he had to get to mokroe and there to finish his romance
almost from the first minute at mokroe he saw that his invincible rival was perhaps by no means so invincible that the toast to their new found happiness was not desired and would not be acceptable
alyosha_karamazov triumph over his rival was complete and his soul passed into quite a new phase perhaps the most terrible phase through which his soul has passed or will pass
but what was awaiting the luckless man but you know the facts gentlemen of the jury from the preliminary inquiry
one may say with certainty gentlemen of the jury the prosecutor continued that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring their own vengeance more completely than any earthly justice
what more justice and punishment on earth positively alleviate the punishment of nature and are indeed essential to the soul of the criminal at such moments as its salvation from despair
for i cannot imagine the horror and moral suffering of alyosha_karamazov when he learnt that she loved him that for his sake she had rejected her first lover that she was summoning him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to a new life that she was promising him happiness and when
by the way i will note in parenthesis a point of importance for the light it throws on the prisoner position at the moment
this woman this love of his had been till the last moment till the very instant of his arrest a being unattainable passionately desired by him but unattainable
yet why did he not shoot himself then why did he relinquish his design and even forget where his pistol was
when everything was over for him and nothing was possible it was just that passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying it that restrained him
throughout their revels he kept close to his adored mistress who was at the banquet with him and was more charming and fascinating to him than ever he did not leave her side abasing himself in his homage before her
his passion might well for a moment stifle not only the fear of arrest but even the torments of conscience
i can picture the state of mind of the criminal hopelessly enslaved by these influences first the influence of drink of noise and excitement of the thud of the dance and the scream of the song and of her flushed with wine singing and dancing and laughing to him
secondly the hope in the background that the fatal end might still be far off that not till next morning at least they would come and take him
for a moment oh only for a moment so he had a few hours and that much very much in a few hours one can think of many things
i imagine that he felt something like what criminals feel when they are being taken to the scaffold they have another long long street to pass down and at walking pace past thousands of people
then there will be a turning into another street and only at the end of that street the dread place of execution
i fancy that at the beginning of the journey the condemned man sitting on his shameful cart must feel that he has infinite life still before him
oh that nothing it still far to the turning into the second street and he still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of callously curious people with their eye fixed on him and he still fancy that he is just such a man as they
oh that nothing nothing there still a whole street before him and however many houses have been passed he will still think there are many left
the houses recede the cart moves on but now the turning comes to the next street and so to the very end to the very scaffold
this i imagine is how it was with alyosha_karamazov then they ve not had time yet he must have thought i may still find some way out
his soul was full of confusion and dread but he managed however to put aside half his money and hide it somewhere i cannot otherwise explain the disappearance of quite half of the three thousand he had just taken from his father_zossima pillow
he had been in mokroe more than once before he had caroused there for two day together already he knew the old big house with all its passages and outbuildings
i imagine that part of the money was hidden in that house not long before the arrest in some crevice under some floor in some corner under the roof
oh there still time to make some plan of defense and now now she is so fascinating with what object i shall be asked
why the catastrophe may take place at once of course he hadnt yet considered how to meet it he hadnt the time his head was throbbing and his heart was with her but money money was indispensable in any case
but he assures us himself that a month before at a critical and exciting moment he had halved his money and sewn it up in a little bag
and though that was not true as we shall prove directly it shows the idea was a familiar one to alyosha_karamazov he had contemplated it
what more when he declared at the inquiry that he had put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag which never existed he may have invented that little bag on the inspiration of the moment because he had two hours before divided his money and hidden half of it at mokroe till morning in case of emergency simply not to have it on himself
with money a man is always a man perhaps such foresight at such a moment may strike you as unnatural two extremes gentlemen of the jury remember that alyosha_karamazov can contemplate two extremes and both at once
we have looked in the house but we havent found the money it may still be there or it may have disappeared next day and be in the prisoner hands now
in any case he was at her side on his knees before her she was lying on the bed he had his hands stretched out to her and he had so entirely forgotten everything that he did not even hear the man coming to arrest him
he hadnt time to prepare any line of defense in his mind he was caught unawares and confronted with his judges the arbiters of his destiny
gentlemen of the jury there are moments in the execution of our duties when it is terrible for us to face a man terrible on his account too
the moments of contemplating that animal fear when the criminal sees that all is lost but still struggles still means to struggle the moments when every instinct of self preservation rises up in him at once and he looks at you with questioning and suffering eye study you your face your thoughts uncertain on which side you will strike and his distracted mind frames thousands of plans in an instant but he is still afraid to speak afraid of giving himself away
this purgatory of the spirit this animal thirst for self preservation these humiliating moments of the human soul are awful and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the criminal even in the lawyer
and this was what we all witnessed then at first he was thunderstruck and in his terror dropped some very compromising phrases
he had not prepared what he was to say what answer he was to make he had nothing but a bare denial ready
blood i ve deserved it but he quickly restrained himself i am not guilty of my father_zossima death that was his fence for the moment and behind it
his first compromising exclamations he hastened to explain by declaring that he was responsible for the death of the servant grigory_vassilyevitch only
he hoped to throw up a barricade of some sort of that bloodshed i am guilty but who has killed my father_zossima gentlemen who has killed him
who can have killed him if not i do you hear he asked us that us who had come to ask him that question
do you hear that phrase uttered with such premature haste if not i the animal cunning the naďveté the alyosha_karamazov impatience of it
i wanted to kill him gentlemen i wanted to kill him he hastens to admit he was in a hurry in a terrible hurry but still i am not guilty
he concedes to us that he wanted to murder him as though to say you can see for yourselves how truthful i am so you ll believe all the sooner that i didnt murder him
i didnt kill him and you mustnt think i did it is not i murdered him oh in such cases the criminal is often amazingly shallow and credulous
at that point one of the lawyers asked him as it were incidentally the most simple question wasnt it smerdyakov killed him
then as we expected he was horribly angry at our having anticipated him and caught him unawares before he had time to pave the way to choose and snatch the moment when it would be most natural to bring in smerdyakov name
he rushed at once to the other extreme as he always does and began to assure us that smerdyakov could not have killed him was not capable of it
but dont believe him that was only his cunning he didnt really give up the idea of smerdyakov on the contrary he meant to bring him forward again for indeed he had no one else to bring forward but he would do that later because for the moment that line was spoiled for him
he would bring him forward perhaps next day or even a few day later choosing an opportunity to cry out to us you know i was more skeptical about smerdyakov than you you remember that yourselves but now i am convinced
he killed him he must have done and for the present he falls back upon a gloomy and irritable denial
impatience and anger prompted him however to the most inept and incredible explanation of how he looked into his father_zossima window and how he respectfully withdrew
the worst of it was that he was unaware of the position of affairs of the evidence given by grigory_vassilyevitch
we proceeded to search him the search angered but encouraged him the whole three thousand had not been found on him only half of it
no doubt he was conscious himself of the improbability of the story and strove painfully to make it sound more likely to weave it into a romance that would sound plausible
in such cases the first duty the chief task of the investigating lawyers is to prevent the criminal being prepared to pounce upon him unexpectedly so that he may blurt out his cherished ideas in all their simplicity improbability and inconsistency
the criminal can only be made to speak by the sudden and apparently incidental communication of some new fact of some circumstance of great importance in the case of which he had no previous idea and could not have foreseen
we had such a fact in readiness that was grigory_vassilyevitch evidence about the open door through which the prisoner had run out
and no doubt only at that moment of angry silence the fiction of the little bag first occurred to him he had completely forgotten about that door and had not even suspected that grigory_vassilyevitch could have seen it
the effect of it was amazing he leapt up and shouted to us then smerdyakov murdered him it was smerdyakov
and so betrayed the basis of the defense he was keeping back and betrayed it in its most improbable shape for smerdyakov could only have committed the murder after he had knocked grigory_vassilyevitch down and run away
when we told him that grigory_vassilyevitch saw the door was open before he fell down and had heard smerdyakov behind the screen as he came out of his bedroom alyosha_karamazov was positively crushed
my esteemed and witty colleague nikolay_parfenovitch_nelyudov told me afterwards that he was almost moved to tears at the sight of him
and to improve matters the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much talked of little bag so be it you shall hear this romance
gentlemen of the jury i have told you already why i consider this romance not only an absurdity but the most improbable invention that could have been brought forward in the circumstances
the worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers can always be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which real life is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary story tellers neglect as insignificant trifles
if one tried for a bet to invent the most unlikely story one could hardly find anything more incredible oh they have no thought to spare for such details
their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a whole and fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle
the prisoner was asked the question where did you get the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you i made it myself
the prisoner was positively offended he thought it almost insulting to ask him such a trivial question and would you believe it his resentment was genuine
but that how they are caught and where did you get the linen but they are all like that i tore it off my shirt
and only fancy gentlemen of the jury if we really had found that torn shirt and how could we have failed to find it in his chest of drawers or trunk that would have been a fact a material fact in support of his statement
then we shall find that shirt among your linen to morrow with a piece torn off but he was incapable of that reflection
i dont remember it may not have been off my shirt i sewed it up in one of my landlady caps
what sort of a cap it was an old cotton rag of her lying about and do you remember that clearly
at the most terrible moments of man life for instance when he is being led to execution he remembers just such trifles
he will forget anything but some green roof that has flashed past him on the road or a jackdaw on a cross that he will remember
he concealed the making of that little bag from his household he must have remembered his humiliating fear that some one might come in and find him needle in hand how at the slightest sound he slipped behind the screen there is a screen in his lodgings
no i dont and he was angry very angry and yet imagine not remembering it but gentlemen of the jury why do i tell you all this all these details trifles
he has not explained anything since that fatal night two months ago he has not added one actual illuminating fact to his former fantastic statements all those are trivialities
cried ippolit_kirillovitch suddenly just because the prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment you must believe it on my honor
oh we are glad to believe it we are eager to believe it even if only on his word of honor
show us a single fact in the prisoner favor and we shall rejoice but let it be a substantial real fact and not a conclusion drawn from the prisoner expression by his own brother or that when he beat himself on the breast he must have meant to point to the little bag in the darkness too
we shall rejoice at the new fact we shall be the first to repudiate our charge we shall hasten to repudiate it
are we jackals thirsting for human blood but now justice cries out and we persist we cannot repudiate anything ippolit_kirillovitch passed to his final peroration
he looked as though he was in a fever he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance the blood of the father_zossima murdered by his son with the base motive of robbery
and whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for the defense ippolit_kirillovitch could not resist adding whatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities remember that at this moment you are in a temple of justice
remember that you are the champions of our justice the champions of our holy russia of her principles her family everything that she holds sacred
yes you represent russia here at this moment and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only but will reëcho throughout the whole of russia and all russia will hear you as her champions and her judges and she will be encouraged or disheartened by your verdict
our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight perhaps to destruction and in all russia for long past man have stretched out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course
and if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be not from respect as the poet would fain believe but simply from horror
he pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of the facts do not disappoint russia and her expectations from horror perhaps from disgust
and well it is that they stand aside but maybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness for the sake of their own safety enlightenment and civilization
already we have heard voices of alarm from europe they already begin to sound do not tempt them do not heap up their growing hatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father_zossima by his son
though ippolit_kirillovitch was genuinely moved he wound up his speech with this rhetorical appeal and the effect produced by him was extraordinary
when he had finished his speech he went out hurriedly and as i have mentioned before almost fainted in the adjoining room
the lady were not so well satisfied though even they were pleased with his eloquence especially as they had no apprehensions as to the upshot of the trial and had full trust in fetyukovitch
there was no applause in the court but serious person were pleased he will speak at last and of course carry all before him
every one looked at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov he sat silent through the whole of the prosecutor speech clenching his teeth with his hands clasped and his head bowed
when the prosecutor mentioned mr_rakitin opinion of her a smile of contempt and anger passed over his face and he murmured rather audibly the bernards
when ippolit_kirillovitch described how he had questioned and tortured him at mokroe mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov raised his head and listened with intense curiosity
at one point he seemed about to jump up and cry out but controlled himself and only shrugged his shoulders disdainfully
people talked afterwards of the end of the speech of the prosecutor feat in examining the prisoner at mokroe and jeered at ippolit_kirillovitch
only from time to time he raised his head and listened especially when grushenka was spoken of the man could not resist boasting of his cleverness they said
the court was adjourned but only for a short interval a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at most there was a hum of conversation and exclamations in the audience
i remember some of them a weighty speech a gentleman in one group observed gravely he brought in too much psychology said another voice
but it was all true the absolute truth yes he is first rate at it he summed it all up
yes he summed us up too chimed in another voice do you remember at the beginning of his speech making out we were all like fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov
and at the end too but that was all rot and obscure too he was a little too much carried away
it unjust it unjust no it was smartly done anyway he had long to wait but he had his say ha ha
in another group i heard he had no business to make a thrust at the petersburg man like that appealing to your sensibilities do you remember
what will the counsel for the defense say yes that was awkward of him he was in too great a hurry
he is a nervous man we laugh but what must the prisoner be feeling yes what must it be for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
in a third group what lady is that the fat one with the lorgnette sitting at the end she is a general wife divorced i know her
that why she has the lorgnette she is not good for much oh no she is a piquante little woman
two places beyond her there is a little fair woman she is prettier they caught him smartly at mokroe didnt they eh
oh it was smart enough we ve heard it before how often he has told the story at people houses
and he couldnt resist doing it now that vanity he is a man with a grievance he he
yes and quick to take offense and there was too much rhetoric such long sentences yes he tries to alarm us he kept trying to alarm us
do you remember about the troika something about they have hamlets but we have so far only karamazovs that was cleverly said
that was to propitiate the liberals he is afraid of them yes and he is afraid of the lawyer too
yes what will fetyukovitch say whatever he says he wont get round our peasants dont you think so
a fourth group what he said about the troika was good that piece about the other nations and that was true what he said about other nations not standing it
why in the english parliament a member got up last week and speaking about the nihilists asked the ministry whether it was not high time to intervene to educate this barbarous people
what do you mean ippolit_kirillovitch was thinking of him i know he was he was talking about that last week
not an easy job not an easy job why not why we shut up kronstadt and not let them have any corn
where would they get it in america they get it from america now nonsense but the bell rang all rushed to their places
fetyukovitch mounted the tribune chapter the speech for the defense an argument that cuts both ways all was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out
the eye of the audience were fastened upon him he began very simply and directly with an air of conviction but not the slightest trace of conceit
he made no attempt at eloquence at pathos or emotional phrases he was like a man speaking in a circle of intimate and sympathetic friends
his voice was a fine one sonorous and sympathetic and there was something genuine and simple in the very sound of it
but every one realized at once that the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and pierce the heart with untold power
his language was perhaps more irregular than ippolit_kirillovitch but he spoke without long phrases and indeed with more precision
one thing did not please the lady he kept bending forward especially at the beginning of his speech not exactly bowing but as though he were about to dart at his listeners bending his long spine in half as though there were a spring in the middle that enabled him to bend almost at right angles
at the beginning of his speech he spoke rather disconnectedly without system one may say dealing with facts separately though at the end these facts formed a whole
his speech might be divided into two parts the first consisting of criticism in refutation of the charge sometimes malicious and sarcastic
but in the second half he suddenly changed his tone and even his manner and at once rose to pathos the audience seemed on the look out for it and quivered with enthusiasm
he went straight to the point and began by saying that although he practiced in petersburg he had more than once visited provincial towns to defend prisoners of whose innocence he had a conviction or at least a preconceived idea
from the very first accounts in the newspapers i was struck by something which strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner favor
what interested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice but rarely i think in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the present case
i ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech but i will do so at the very beginning for it is my weakness to go to work directly not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing my material
that is what has happened to me in the present case he explained that may be imprudent on my part but at least it sincere
what i have in my mind is this there is an overwhelming chain of evidence against the prisoner and at the same time not one fact that will stand criticism if it is examined separately
as i followed the case more closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed and i suddenly received from the prisoner relatives a request to undertake his defense
it was to break down this terrible chain of facts and to show that each piece of evidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic that i undertook the case
i at once hurried here and here i became completely convinced so fetyukovitch began gentlemen of the jury he suddenly protested i am new to this district
i have no preconceived ideas the prisoner a man of turbulent and unbridled temper has not insulted me but he has insulted perhaps hundreds of person in this town and so prejudiced many people against him beforehand
of course i recognize that the moral sentiment of local society is justly excited against him the prisoner is of turbulent and violent temper
yet he was received in society here he was even welcome in the family of my talented friend the prosecutor
all of us knew that the prosecutor received mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov against his will solely because he had somehow interested his wife a lady of the highest virtue and moral worth but fanciful capricious and fond of opposing her husband especially in trifles
b at these words there were two or three laughs in the audience quickly suppressed but noticed by all mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov visits however had not been frequent
nevertheless i venture to suggest fetyukovitch continued that in spite of his independent mind and just character my opponent may have formed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate client
oh that is so natural the unfortunate man has only too well deserved such prejudice outraged morality and still more outraged taste is often relentless
we have in the talented prosecutor speech heard a stern analysis of the prisoner character and conduct and his severe critical attitude to the case was evident
and what more he went into psychological subtleties into which he could not have entered if he had the least conscious and malicious prejudice against the prisoner
but there are things which are even worse even more fatal in such cases than the most malicious and consciously unfair attitude
it is worse if we are carried away by the artistic instinct by the desire to create so to speak a romance especially if god has endowed us with psychological insight
before i started on my way here i was warned in petersburg and was myself aware that i should find here a talented opponent whose psychological insight and subtlety had gained him peculiar renown in legal circles of recent years
but profound as psychology is it a knife that cuts both ways laughter among the public you will of course forgive me my comparison i cant boast of eloquence
the prisoner running away in the garden in the dark climbed over the fence was seized by the servant and knocked him down with a brass pestle
then he jumped back into the garden and spent five minutes over the man trying to discover whether he had killed him or not
but i will take as an example any point in the prosecutor speech and the prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner statement that he ran to old grigory_vassilyevitch out of pity
no he says such sensibility is impossible at such a moment that unnatural he ran to find out whether the only witness of his crime was dead or alive and so showed that he had committed the murder since he would not have run back for any other reason
here you have psychology but let us take the same method and apply it to the case the other way round and our result will be no less probable
the murderer we are told leapt down to find out as a precaution whether the witness was alive or not yet he had left in his murdered father_zossima study as the prosecutor himself argues an amazing piece of evidence in the shape of a torn envelope with an inscription that there had been three thousand roubles in it
if he had carried that envelope away with him no one in the world would have known of that envelope and of the notes in it and that the money had been stolen by the prisoner
so on one side you see a complete absence of precaution a man who has lost his head and run away in a fright leaving that clew on the floor and two minutes later when he has killed another man we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating foresight in him
but even admitting this was so it is psychological subtlety i suppose that discerns that under certain circumstances i become as bloodthirsty and keen sighted as a caucasian eagle while at the next i am as timid and blind as a mole
but if i am so bloodthirsty and cruelly calculating that when i kill a man i only run back to find out whether he is alive to witness against me why should i spend five minutes looking after my victim at the risk of encountering other witnesses
those are the prosecutor own words why soak my handkerchief wiping the blood off his head so that it may be evidence against me later
if he were so cold hearted and calculating why not hit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as to kill him outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness
again though he ran to see whether the witness was alive he left another witness on the path that brass pestle which he had taken from the two women and which they could always recognize afterwards as theirs and prove that he had taken it from them
as though he had forgotten it on the path dropped it through carelessness or haste no he had flung away his weapon for it was found fifteen paces from where grigory_vassilyevitch lay
just because he was grieved at having killed a man an old servant and he flung away the pestle with a curse as a murderous weapon
and it is not why did he do so that how it must have been what other reason could he have had for throwing it so far
and if he was capable of feeling grief and pity at having killed a man it shows that he was innocent of his father_zossima murder
had he murdered him he would never have run to another victim out of pity then he would have felt differently his thoughts would have been centered on self preservation
he would have had none to spare for pity that is beyond doubt on the contrary he would have broken his skull instead of spending five minutes looking after him
there was room for pity and good feeling just because his conscience had been clear till then here we have a different psychology
i have purposely resorted to this method gentlemen of the jury to show that you can prove anything by it it all depends on who makes use of it
psychology lures even most serious people into romancing and quite unconsciously i am speaking of the abuse of psychology gentlemen
sounds of approval and laughter at the expense of the prosecutor were again audible in the court i will not repeat the speech in detail i will only quote some passages from it some leading points
chapter xi there was no money there was no robbery there was one point that struck every one in fetyukovitch speech
he flatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand roubles and consequently the possibility of their having been stolen
every new and unprejudiced observer must be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the present case namely the charge of robbery and the complete impossibility of proving that there was anything to be stolen
gentlemen of the jury he began we are told that money was stolen three thousand roubles but whether those roubles ever existed nobody knows
consider how have we heard of that sum and who has seen the notes the only person who saw them and stated that they had been put in the envelope was the servant smerdyakov
he had spoken of it to the prisoner and his brother ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov before the catastrophe madame_svyetlov too had been told of it
here the question arises if it true that they did exist and that smerdyakov had seen them when did he see them for the last time
what if his master had taken the notes from under his bed and put them back in his cash box without telling him
but not one of these three person had actually seen the notes no one but smerdyakov had seen them note that according to smerdyakov story the notes were kept under the mattress
the prisoner must have pulled them out and yet the bed was absolutely unrumpled that is carefully recorded in the protocol
how could the prisoner have found the notes without disturbing the bed how could he have helped soiling with his blood
stained hands the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had been purposely made but i shall be asked what about the envelope on the floor
yes it worth saying a word or two about that envelope i was somewhat surprised just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor declare of himself of himself observe that
but for that envelope but for its being left on the floor no one in the world would have known of the existence of that envelope and the notes in it and therefore of the prisoner having stolen it
the sole proof on which the charge of robbery rests otherwise no one would have known of the robbery nor perhaps even of the money
but is the mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a proof that there was money in it and that that money had been stolen
and so that torn scrap of paper is by the prosecutor own admission yet it will be objected smerdyakov had seen the money in the envelope
but when when had he seen it for the last time i ask you that i talked to smerdyakov and he told me that he had seen the notes two day before the catastrophe
then why not imagine that old fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov locked up alone in impatient and hysterical expectation of the object of his adoration may have whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and taking out the notes
she wont believe the notes are there but when i show her the thirty rainbow colored notes in one roll it will make more impression you may be sure it will make her mouth water
and so he tears open the envelope takes out the money and flings the envelope on the floor conscious of being the owner and untroubled by any fears of leaving evidence
what the use of the envelope he may have asked himself listen gentlemen could anything be more likely than this theory and such an action
but if anything of the sort could have taken place the charge of robbery falls to the ground if there was no money there was no theft of it
if the envelope on the floor may be taken as evidence that there had been money in it why may i not maintain the opposite that the envelope was on the floor because the money had been taken from it by its owner
but i shall be asked what became of the money if fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov took it out of the envelope since it was not found when the police searched the house
in the first place part of the money was found in the cash box and secondly he might have taken it out that morning or the evening before to make some other use of it to give or send it away he may have changed his idea his plan of action completely without thinking it necessary to announce the fact to smerdyakov beforehand
and if there is the barest possibility of such an explanation how can the prisoner be so positively accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery and of having actually carried out that robbery
if it is maintained that something has been stolen the thing must be produced or at least its existence must be proved beyond doubt
why is it out of the question this is encroaching on the domain of romance yet no one had ever seen these notes
a young man of eighteen hardly more than a boy who carried on a small business as a costermonger went in broad daylight into a moneychanger shop with an ax and with extraordinary typical audacity killed the master of the shop and carried off fifteen hundred roubles
five hours later he was arrested and except fifteen roubles he had already managed to spend the whole sum was found on him
moreover the shopman on his return to the shop after the murder informed the police not only of the exact sum stolen but even of the notes and gold coins of which that sum was made up and those very notes and coins were found on the criminal
not long ago in petersburg this was followed by a full and genuine confession on the part of the murderer
that what i call evidence gentlemen of the jury in that case i know i see i touch the money and cannot deny its existence
yes i shall be told but he was carousing that night squandering money he was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles where did he get the money
but the very fact that only fifteen hundred could be found and the other half of the sum could nowhere be discovered shows that that money was not the same and had never been in any envelope
by strict calculation of time it was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the prisoner ran straight from those women servants to pyotr_ilyitch_perhotin without going home and that he had been nowhere
so he had been all the time in company and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half and hidden half in the town
it just this consideration that has led the prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at mokroe
is it the same in the present case and yet it is a question of life and death why not in the dungeons of the castle of udolpho gentlemen
and observe if that supposition breaks down the whole charge of robbery is scattered to the winds for in that case what could have become of the other fifteen hundred roubles
isnt this supposition really too fantastic and too romantic by what miracle could they have disappeared since it proved the prisoner went nowhere else
i shall be told that he could not explain where he got the fifteen hundred that he had and every one knew that he was without money before that night
the prisoner has made a clear and unflinching statement of the source of that money and if you will have it so gentlemen of the jury nothing can be more probable than that statement and more consistent with the temper and spirit of the prisoner
and we are ready to ruin a man life with such tales who knew it pray the prosecutor is charmed with his own romance
a man of weak will who had brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by his betrothed could not we are told have set aside half and sewn it up but would even if he had done so have unpicked it every two day and taken out a hundred and so would have spent it all in a month
all this you will remember was put forward in a tone that brooked no contradiction but what if the thing happened quite differently
what if you ve been weaving a romance and about quite a different kind of man that just it you have invented quite a different man
i shall be told perhaps there are witnesses that he spent on one day all that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month before the catastrophe so he could not have divided the sum in half
besides in another man hand a crust always seems larger and no one of these witnesses counted that money they all judged simply at sight
but who are these witnesses the value of their evidence has been shown in court already and the witness maximov has testified that the prisoner had twenty thousand in his hand
you see gentlemen of the jury psychology is a two edged weapon let me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it
a month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by katerina_ivanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post
but the question is is it true that they were entrusted to him in such an insulting and degrading way as was proclaimed just now
the first statement made by the young lady on the subject was different perfectly different in the second statement we heard only cries of resentment and revenge cries of long concealed hatred
and the very fact that the witness gave her first evidence incorrectly gives us a right to conclude that her second piece of evidence may have been incorrect also
i will not touch on it either but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and high principled person such as that highly respected young lady unquestionably is if such a person i say allows herself suddenly in court to contradict her first statement with the obvious motive of ruining the prisoner it is clear that this evidence has been given not impartially not coolly
the prosecutor will not dare not his own words touch on that story so be it have not we the right to assume that a revengeful woman might have exaggerated much
no it was offered in such a way that it was possible to take it especially for a man so easy going as the prisoner above all as he expected to receive shortly from his father_zossima the three thousand roubles that he reckoned was owing to him
it was unreflecting of him but it was just his irresponsible want of reflection that made him so confident that his father_zossima would give him the money that he would get it and so could always dispatch the money entrusted to him and repay the debt
but the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day have set aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag
yes she may well have exaggerated in particular the insult and humiliation of her offering him the money that not his character he tells us he couldnt have had such feeling
but yet he talked himself of the broad alyosha_karamazov nature he cried out about the two extremes which a alyosha_karamazov can contemplate at once
alyosha_karamazov is just such a two sided nature fluctuating between two extremes that even when moved by the most violent craving for riotous gayety he can pull himself up if something strikes him on the other side
and on the other side is love that new love which had flamed up in his heart and for that love he needed money
if she were to say to him i am yours i wont have fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov then he must have money to take her away
oh far more than for carousing with his mistress that was more important than carousing could a alyosha_karamazov fail to understand it
that anxiety was just what he was suffering from what is there improbable in his laying aside that money and concealing it in case of emergency
but time passed and fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov did not give the prisoner the expected three thousand on the contrary the latter heard that he meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he the prisoner loved
if fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov doesnt give the money he thought i shall be put in the position of a thief before katerina_ivanovna
and then the idea presented itself to him that he would go to katerina_ivanovna lay before her the fifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck and say i am a scoundrel but not a thief
so here we have already a twofold reason why he should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye why he shouldnt unpick the little bag and spend it a hundred at a time
why should you deny the prisoner a sense of honor yes he has a sense of honor granted that it misplaced granted
but now the affair becomes even more complex his jealous torments reach a climax and those same two questions torture his fevered brain more and more if i repay katerina_ivanovna where can i find the means to go off with grushenka
if he behaved wildly drank and made disturbances in the taverns in the course of that month it was perhaps because he was wretched and strained beyond his powers of endurance
it often mistaken yet it exists and amounts to a passion and he has proved that these two questions became so acute that they drove him at last to despair
he sent his younger brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles but without waiting for a reply burst in himself and ended by beating the old man in the presence of witnesses
after that he had no prospect of getting it from any one his father_zossima would not give it him after that beating
the same evening he struck himself on the breast just on the upper part of the breast where the little bag was and swore to his brother that he had the means of not being a scoundrel but that still he would remain a scoundrel for he foresaw that he would not use that means that he wouldnt have the character that he wouldnt have the will power to do it
why why does the prosecutor refuse to believe the evidence of alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov given so genuinely and sincerely so spontaneously and convincingly
and why on the contrary does he force me to believe in money hidden in a crevice in the dungeons of the castle of udolpho
the same evening after his talk with his brother the prisoner wrote that fatal letter and that letter is the chief the most stupendous proof of the prisoner having committed robbery
i shall murder my father_zossima and shall take the envelope with the pink ribbon on it from under his mattress as soon as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has gone
i shall beg from every one and if i dont get it a full program of the murder we are told so it must have been he
but in the first place it the letter of a drunken man and written in great irritation secondly he writes of the envelope from what he has heard from smerdyakov again for he has not seen the envelope himself and thirdly he wrote it indeed but how can you prove that he did it
it has all been done as he wrote cries the prosecutor did the prisoner take the envelope from under the pillow did he find the money did that money exist indeed
and was it to get money that the prisoner ran off if you remember he ran off post haste not to steal but to find out where she was the woman who had crushed him
he was not running to carry out a program to carry out what he had written that is not for an act of premeditated robbery but he ran suddenly spontaneously in a jealous fury
yes i shall be told but when he got there and murdered him he seized the money too but did he murder him after all
the charge of robbery i repudiate with indignation a man cannot be accused of robbery if it impossible to state accurately what he has stolen that an axiom
but did he murder him without robbery did he murder him at all is that proved isnt that too a romance
either allow me gentlemen of the jury to remind you that a man life is at stake and that you must be careful
we have heard the prosecutor himself admit that until to day he hesitated to accuse the prisoner of a full and conscious premeditation of the crime he hesitated till he saw that fatal drunken letter which was produced in court to day
chapter xii and there was no murder all was done as written but i repeat again he was running to her to seek her solely to find out where she was
had she been at home he would not have run away but would have remained at her side and so would not have done what he promised in the letter
that a fact that cant be disputed he ran unexpectedly and accidentally and by that time very likely he did not even remember his drunken letter
he snatched up the pestle they say and you will remember how a whole edifice of psychology was built on that pestle why he was bound to look at that pestle as a weapon to snatch it up and so on and so on
a very commonplace idea occurs to me at this point what if that pestle had not been in sight had not been lying on the shelf from which it was snatched by the prisoner but had been put away in a cupboard
it would not have caught the prisoner eye and he would have run away without a weapon with empty hands and then he would certainly not have killed any one
yes but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father_zossima and two day before on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter he was quiet and only quarreled with a shopman in the tavern because a alyosha_karamazov could not help quarreling forsooth
but my answer to that is that if he was planning such a murder in accordance with his letter he certainly would not have quarreled even with a shopman and probably would not have gone into the tavern at all because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet and retirement seeks to efface himself to avoid being seen and heard and that not from calculation but from instinct
how then can i look upon the pestle as a proof of premeditation gentlemen of the jury the psychological method is a two edged weapon and we too can use it
as for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month dont we often hear child or drunkards coming out of taverns shout i ll kill you
but they dont murder any one and that fatal letter isnt that simply drunken irritability too isnt that simply the shout of the brawler outside the tavern i ll kill you
i ll kill the lot of you why not why could it not be that what reason have we to call that letter fatal rather than absurd
because his father_zossima has been found murdered because a witness saw the prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in his hand and was knocked down by him therefore we are told everything was done as he had planned in writing and the letter was not absurd but fatal
now thank god we ve come to the real point since he was in the garden he must have murdered him
in those few words since he was then he must lies the whole case for the prosecution he was there so he must have
and what if there is no must about it even if he was there oh i admit that the chain of evidence the coincidences are really suggestive
why for instance does the prosecution refuse to admit the truth of the prisoner statement that he ran away from his father_zossima window
remember the sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the expense of the respectful and pious sentiments which suddenly came over the murderer
but examine all these facts separately regardless of their connection but what if there were something of the sort a feeling of religious awe if not of filial respect
my mother must have been praying for me at that moment were the prisoner words at the preliminary inquiry and so he ran away as soon as he convinced himself that madame_svyetlov was not in his father_zossima house
but he could not convince himself by looking through the window the prosecutor objects but why couldnt he why the window opened at the signals given by the prisoner
some word might have been uttered by fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov some exclamation which showed the prisoner that she was not there why should we assume everything as we imagine it as we make up our minds to imagine it
a thousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest imagination yes but grigory_vassilyevitch saw the door open
now about that door gentlemen of the jury observe that we have only the statement of one witness as to that door and he was at the time in such a condition that
but supposing the door was open supposing the prisoner has lied in denying it from an instinct of self defense natural in his position supposing he did go into the house well what then
and so the prisoner certainly was in the house therefore he killed him how does it follow that because he was there he committed the murder
he might have dashed in run through the rooms might have pushed his father_zossima away might have struck him but as soon as he had made sure madame_svyetlov was not there he may have run away rejoicing that she was not there and that he had not killed his father_zossima
and it was perhaps just because he had escaped from the temptation to kill his father_zossima because he had a clear conscience and was rejoicing at not having killed him that he was capable of a pure feeling the feeling of pity and compassion and leapt off the fence a minute later to the assistance of grigory_vassilyevitch after he had in his excitement knocked him down
with terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the dreadful state of the prisoner mind at mokroe when love again lay before him calling him to new life while love was impossible for him because he had his father_zossima bloodstained corpse behind him and beyond that corpse retribution
and yet the prosecutor allowed him love which he explained according to his method talking about his drunken condition about a criminal being taken to execution about it being still far off and so on and so on
is the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to be able to think at that moment of love and of dodges to escape punishment if his hands were really stained with his father_zossima blood
as soon as it was made plain to him that she loved him and called him to her side promising him new happiness oh
then i protest he must have felt the impulse to suicide doubled trebled and must have killed himself if he had his father_zossima murder on his conscience
but again i ask mr prosecutor have you not invented a new personality no no no oh no he would not have forgotten where his pistol lay
i know the prisoner the savage stony heartlessness ascribed to him by the prosecutor is inconsistent with his character he would have killed himself that certain
he did not kill himself just because his mother prayers had saved him and he was innocent of his father_zossima blood
he was troubled he was grieving that night at mokroe only about old grigory_vassilyevitch and praying to god that the old man would recover that his blow had not been fatal and that he would not have to suffer for it
why not accept such an interpretation of the facts what trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying but we shall be told at once again there is his father_zossima corpse
if he ran away without murdering him who did murder him here i repeat you have the whole logic of the prosecution
who murdered him if not he there no one to put in his place gentlemen of the jury is that really so
is it positively actually true that there is no one else at all we ve heard the prosecutor count on his fingers all the person who were in that house that night
they were five in number three of them i agree could not have been responsible the murdered man himself old grigory_vassilyevitch and his wife
there are left then the prisoner and smerdyakov and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the prisoner pointed to smerdyakov because he had no one else to fix on that had there been a sixth person even a phantom of a sixth person he would have abandoned the charge against smerdyakov at once in shame and have accused that other
but gentlemen of the jury why may i not draw the very opposite conclusion there are two person the prisoner and smerdyakov
why can i not say that you accuse my client simply because you have no one else to accuse and you have no one else only because you have determined to exclude smerdyakov from all suspicion
but there are others who accuse him there are vague rumor of a question of a suspicion an obscure report a feeling of expectation
it true indeed smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner his two brothers and madame_svyetlov finally we have the evidence of a combination of facts very suggestive though i admit inconclusive
in the first place we have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that fit for the genuineness of which the prosecutor for some reason has felt obliged to make a careful defense
then the equally startling evidence given in court to day by the elder of the prisoner brothers who had believed in his guilt but has to day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed smerdyakov as the murderer
oh i fully share the court and the prosecutor conviction that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov is suffering from brain fever that his statement may really be a desperate effort planned in delirium to save his brother by throwing the guilt on the dead man
then smerdyakov sudden suicide on the eve of the trial but again smerdyakov name is pronounced again there is a suggestion of mystery
there is something unexplained incomplete and perhaps it may one day be explained but we wont go into that now of that later
the court has resolved to go on with the trial but meantime i might make a few remarks about the character sketch of smerdyakov drawn with subtlety and talent by the prosecutor
i have visited smerdyakov i have seen him and talked to him and he made a very different impression on me
he was weak in health it is true but in character in spirit he was by no means the weak man the prosecutor has made him out to be
but while i admire his talent i cannot agree with him i found in him no trace of the timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted
i found in him on the contrary an extreme mistrustfulness concealed under a mask of naďveté and an intelligence of considerable range
he made a very definite impression on me i left him with the conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature excessively ambitious vindictive and intensely envious
i made some inquiries he resented his parentage was ashamed of it and would clench his teeth when he remembered that he was the son of stinking lizaveta
there was no simplicity about him either the prosecutor was too simple in taking him for weak minded he was disrespectful to the servant grigory_vassilyevitch and his wife who had cared for him in his childhood
he cursed and jeered at russia he dreamed of going to france and becoming a frenchman he used often to say that he hadnt the means to do so
i fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely high opinion of himself his conception of culture was limited to good clothes clean shirt fronts and polished boots
believing himself to be the illegitimate son of fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov there is evidence of this he might well have resented his position compared with that of his master legitimate sons
they had everything he nothing they had all the rights they had the inheritance while he was only the cook he told me himself that he had helped fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov to put the notes in the envelope
the destination of that sum a sum which would have made his career must have been hateful to him moreover he saw three thousand roubles in new rainbow colored notes
i asked him about that on purpose oh beware of showing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of money at once
and it was the first time he had seen so much money in the hands of one man the sight of the rainbow colored notes may have made a morbid impression on his imagination but with no immediate results
the talented prosecutor with extraordinary subtlety sketched for us all the arguments for and against the hypothesis of smerdyakov guilt and asked us in particular what motive he had in feigning a fit
but he may not have been feigning at all the fit may have happened quite naturally but it may have passed off quite naturally and the sick man may have recovered not completely perhaps but still regaining consciousness as happens with epileptics
the prosecutor asks at what moment could smerdyakov have committed the murder but it is very easy to point out that moment
he might have waked up from deep sleep for he was only asleep an epileptic fit is always followed by a deep sleep at that moment when the old grigory_vassilyevitch shouted at the top of his voice parricide
that shout in the dark and stillness may have waked smerdyakov whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment he might naturally have waked up an hour before
getting out of bed he goes almost unconsciously and with no definite motive towards the sound to see what the matter
his head is still clouded with his attack his faculties are half asleep but once in the garden he walks to the lighted windows and he hears terrible news from his master who would be of course glad to see him
he hears all the details from his frightened master and gradually in his disordered brain there shapes itself an idea terrible but seductive and irresistibly logical
his mind sets to work at once to kill the old man take the three thousand and throw all the blame on to his young master
oh these sudden and irresistible impulses come so often when there is a favorable opportunity and especially with murderers who have had no idea of committing a murder beforehand
a terrible lust of money of booty might seize upon him as he realized his security from detection and smerdyakov may have gone in and carried out his plan
with what weapon why with any stone picked up in the garden but what for with what object why the three thousand which means a career for him
oh i am not contradicting myself the money may have existed and perhaps smerdyakov alone knew where to find it where his master kept it
just now when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory that only an inexperienced thief like alyosha_karamazov would have left the envelope on the floor and not one like smerdyakov who would have avoided leaving a piece of evidence against himself i thought as i listened that i was hearing something very familiar and would you believe it i have heard that very argument that very conjecture of how alyosha_karamazov would have behaved precisely two day before from smerdyakov himself
i fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about him that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that i might fancy
and the covering of the money the torn envelope on the floor what more it struck me at the time it was my own
he insinuated it as it were did he not insinuate the same idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor
i shall be asked what about the old woman grigory_vassilyevitch wife she heard the sick man moaning close by all night
i knew a lady who complained bitterly that she had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard
yes she heard it but that evidence is extremely unreliable yet the poor beast it appeared had only yelped once or twice in the night
if any one is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up annoyed at being waked but instantly falls asleep again
two hours later again a groan he wakes up and falls asleep again and the same thing again two hours later three time altogether in the night
and that natural next morning the sleeper wakes up and complains that some one has been groaning all night and keeping him awake
and it is bound to seem so to him the interval of two hours of sleep he does not remember he only remembers the moments of waking so he feels he has been waked up all night
but why why asks the prosecutor did not smerdyakov confess in his last letter why did his conscience prompt him to one step and not to both
but excuse me conscience implies penitence and the suicide may not have felt penitence but only despair despair and penitence are two very different things
despair may be vindictive and irreconcilable and the suicide laying his hands on himself may well have felt redoubled hatred for those whom he had envied all his life
gentlemen of the jury beware of a miscarriage of justice what is there unlikely in all i have put before you just now
and if there is but a shade of possibility but a shade of probability in my propositions do not condemn him
i swear by all that is sacred i fully believe in the explanation of the murder i have just put forward
what troubles me and makes me indignant is that of all the mass of facts heaped up by the prosecution against the prisoner there is not a single one certain and irrefutable
find the error in my reasoning find the impossibility the absurdity and is there only a shade and yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by the accumulation of these facts
yes the accumulated effect is awful the blood the blood dripping from his fingers the bloodstained shirt the dark night resounding with the shout parricide
this has so much influence it can so bias the mind but gentlemen of the jury can it bias your minds
remember you have been given absolute power to bind and to loose but the greater the power the more terrible its responsibility
i do not draw back one iota from what i have said just now but suppose for one moment i agreed with the prosecution that my luckless client had stained his hands with his father_zossima blood
and the old man falling with a broken head and then the mass of phrases statements gestures shouts oh this is only hypothesis i repeat
i never for one instant doubt of his innocence but so be it i assume that my client is guilty of parricide
even so hear what i have to say i have it in my heart to say something more to you for i feel that there must be a great conflict in your hearts and minds
forgive my referring to your hearts and minds gentlemen of the jury but i want to be truthful and sincere to the end
the last words indeed were pronounced with a note of such sincerity that every one felt that he really might have something to say and that what he was about to say would be of the greatest consequence
but the president hearing the applause in a loud voice threatened to clear the court if such an incident were repeated
every sound was hushed and fetyukovitch began in a voice full of feeling quite unlike the tone he had used hitherto
let us all be sincere at this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause chapter xiii a corrupter of thought
it not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client with ruin gentlemen of the jury he began what is really damning for my client is one fact the dead body of his father_zossima
had it been an ordinary case of murder you would have rejected the charge in view of the triviality the incompleteness and the fantastic character of the evidence if you examine each part of it separately or at least you would have hesitated to ruin a man life simply from the prejudice against him which he has alas
that impresses man minds and to such a degree that the very triviality and incompleteness of the evidence becomes less trivial and less incomplete even to an unprejudiced mind
only too well deserved but it not an ordinary case of murder it a case of parricide how can such a prisoner be acquitted
what if he committed the murder and gets off unpunished that is what every one almost involuntarily instinctively feels at heart
yes it a fearful thing to shed a father_zossima blood the father_zossima who has begotten me loved me not spared his life for me grieved over my illnesses from childhood up troubled all his life for my happiness and has lived in my joys in my successes
to murder such a father_zossima that inconceivable gentlemen of the jury what is a father_zossima a real father_zossima what is the meaning of that great word
what is the great idea in that name we have just indicated in part what a true father_zossima is and what he ought to be
in the case in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our hearts are aching in the present case the father_zossima fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov alyosha_karamazov did not correspond to that conception of a father_zossima to which we have just referred
let us examine this misfortune rather more closely we must shrink from nothing gentlemen of the jury considering the importance of the decision you have to make
it our particular duty not to shrink from any idea like child or frightened women as the talented prosecutor happily expresses it
but in the course of his heated speech my esteemed opponent and he was my opponent before i opened my lips exclaimed several time oh i will not yield the defense of the prisoner to the lawyer who has come down from petersburg
he exclaimed that several time but forgot to mention that if this terrible prisoner was for twenty three years so grateful for a mere pound of nuts given him by the only man who had been kind to him as a child in his father_zossima house might not such a man well have remembered for twenty three years how he ran in his father_zossima back yard without boots on his feet and with his little trousers hanging by one button to use the expression of the kind hearted doctor herzenstube
that the misfortune and indeed some fathers are a misfortune i accuse but i defend also oh gentlemen of the jury why need we look more closely at this misfortune
what did my client meet with when he arrived here at his father_zossima house and why depict my client as a heartless egoist and monster
why repeat what we all know already he is uncontrolled he is wild and unruly we are trying him now for that but who is responsible for his life
who is responsible for his having received such an unseemly bringing up in spite of his excellent disposition and his grateful and sensitive heart
did any one train him to be reasonable was he enlightened by study did any one love him ever so little in his childhood
my client was left to the care of providence like a beast of the field he thirsted perhaps to see his father_zossima after long years of separation
a thousand time perhaps he may recalling his childhood have driven away the loathsome phantoms that haunted his childish dreams and with all his heart he may have longed to embrace and to forgive his father_zossima
he heard nothing but revolting talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the brandy and at last he saw his father_zossima seducing his mistress from him with his own money
and what awaited him he was met by cynical taunts suspicions and wrangling about money oh gentlemen of the jury that was cruel and revolting
and that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and cruelty of his son he slandered him in society injured him calumniated him bought up his unpaid debts to get him thrown into prison
gentlemen of the jury people like my client who are fierce unruly and uncontrolled on the surface are sometimes most frequently indeed exceedingly tender hearted only they dont express it
dont laugh dont laugh at my idea the talented prosecutor laughed mercilessly just now at my client for loving schiller loving the sublime and beautiful
i should not have laughed at that in his place yes such natures oh let me speak in defense of such natures
so often and so cruelly misunderstood these natures often thirst for tenderness goodness and justice as it were in contrast to themselves their unruliness their ferocity they thirst for it unconsciously
passionate and fierce on the surface they are painfully capable of loving woman for instance and with a spiritual and elevated love
again do not laugh at me this is very often the case in such natures but they cannot hide their passions sometimes very coarse and that is conspicuous and is noticed but the inner man is unseen
their passions are quickly exhausted but by the side of a noble and lofty creature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks a new life seeks to correct himself to be better to become noble and honorable sublime and beautiful however much the expression has been ridiculed
i said just now that i would not venture to touch upon my client engagement but i may say half a word
what we heard just now was not evidence but only the scream of a frenzied and revengeful woman and it was not for her oh not for her to reproach him with treachery for she has betrayed him
if she had had but a little time for reflection she would not have given such evidence oh do not believe her
no my client is not a monster as she called him the lover of mankind on the eve of his crucifixion said i am the good shepherd
the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep so that not one of them might be lost let not a man soul be lost through us
but one must use words honestly gentlemen and i venture to call things by their right names such a father_zossima as old alyosha_karamazov cannot be called a father_zossima and does not deserve to be
i asked just now what does father_zossima mean and exclaimed that it was a great word a precious name filial love for an unworthy father_zossima is an absurdity an impossibility
love cannot be created from nothing only god can create something from nothing fathers provoke not your child to wrath the apostle writes from a heart glowing with love
it not for the sake of my client that i quote these sacred words i mention them for all fathers who has authorized me to preach to fathers
no one but as a man and a citizen i make my appeal vivos voco we are not long on earth we do many evil deeds and say many evil words
so let us all catch a favorable moment when we are all together to say a good word to each other
that what i am doing while i am in this place i take advantage of my opportunity not for nothing is this tribune given us by the highest authority all russia hears us
i am not speaking only for the fathers here present i cry aloud to all fathers fathers provoke not your child to wrath
otherwise we are not fathers but enemies of our child and they are not our child but our enemies and we have made them our enemies ourselves
yes let us first fulfill church_of_christ injunction ourselves and only then venture to expect it of our child what measure ye mete
it shall be measured unto you again it not i who say that it the gospel precept measure to others according as they measure to you
how can we blame child if they measure us according to our measure not long ago a servant girl in finland was suspected of having secretly given birth to a child
she was watched and a box of which no one knew anything was found in the corner of the loft behind some bricks
in the same box were found the skeletons of two other babies which according to her own confession she had killed at the moment of their birth
it was opened and inside was found the body of a new born child which she had killed gentlemen of the jury was she a mother to her child
she gave birth to them indeed but was she a mother to them would any one venture to give her the sacred name of mother
let us be bold gentlemen let us be audacious even it our duty to be so at this moment and not to be afraid of certain words and ideas like the moscow women in ostrovsky play who are scared at the sound of certain words
no let us prove that the progress of the last few years has touched even us and let us say plainly the father_zossima is not merely he who begets the child but
oh of course there is the other meaning there is the other interpretation of the word father_zossima which insists that any father_zossima even though he be a monster even though he be the enemy of his child still remains my father_zossima simply because he begot me
but this is so to say the mystical meaning which i cannot comprehend with my intellect but can only accept by faith or better to say on faith like many other things which i do not understand but which religion bids me believe
he who begets it and does his duty by it but in that case let it be kept outside the sphere of actual life
in the sphere of actual life which has indeed its own rights but also lays upon us great duties and obligations in that sphere if we want to be humane christian in fact we must or ought to act only upon convictions justified by reason and experience which have been passed through the crucible of analysis in a word we must act rationally and not as though in dream and delirium that we may not do harm that we may not ill treat and ruin a man
there was violent applause at this passage from many parts of the court but fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring them to let him finish without interruption
then it will be real christian work not only mystic but rational and philanthropic the court relapsed into silence at once
the orator went on do you suppose gentlemen that our child as they grow up and begin to reason can avoid such questions
the sight of an unworthy father_zossima involuntarily suggests tormenting questions to a young creature especially when he compares him with the excellent fathers of his companions
the conventional answer to this question is he begot you and you are his flesh and blood and therefore you are bound to love him
no they cannot and we will not impose on them an impossible restriction the youth involuntarily reflects but did he love me when he begot me
he did not know me not even my sex at that moment at the moment of passion perhaps inflamed by wine and he has only transmitted to me a propensity to drunkenness
he asks wondering more and more was it for my sake he begot me that all he done for me
why am i bound to love him simply for begetting me when he has cared nothing for me all my life after
oh perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel but do not expect an impossible restraint from a young mind
drive nature out of the door and it will fly in at the window and above all let us not be afraid of words but decide the question according to the dictates of reason and humanity and not of mystic ideas
how shall it be decided why like this let the son stand before his father_zossima and ask him father_zossima tell me why must i love you
if that father_zossima is able to answer him and show him good reason we have a real normal parental relation not resting on mystical prejudice but on a rational responsible and strictly humanitarian basis
father_zossima show me that i must love you and but if he does not there an end to the family tie
he is not a father_zossima to him and the son has a right to look upon him as a stranger and even an enemy
our tribune gentlemen of the jury ought to be a school of true and sound ideas here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost frantic applause
of course it was not the whole audience but a good half of it applauded the fathers and mothers present applauded
shrieks and exclamations were heard from the gallery where the lady were sitting handkerchiefs were waved the president began ringing his bell with all his might
he was obviously irritated by the behavior of the audience but did not venture to clear the court as he had threatened
even person of high position old man with stars on their breasts sitting on specially reserved seats behind the judges applauded the orator and waved their handkerchiefs
so that when the noise died down the president confined himself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court and fetyukovitch excited and triumphant continued his speech
gentlemen of the jury you remember that awful night of which so much has been said to day when the son got over the fence and stood face to face with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten him
i insist most emphatically it was not for money he ran to his father_zossima house the charge of robbery is an absurdity as i proved before
and it was not to murder him he broke into the house oh no if he had had that design he would at least have taken the precaution of arming himself beforehand
granted that he deceived his father_zossima by tapping at the window granted that he made his way in i ve said already that i do not for a moment believe that legend but let it be so let us suppose it for a moment
gentlemen i swear to you by all that holy if it had not been his father_zossima but an ordinary enemy he would after running through the rooms and satisfying himself that the woman was not there have made off post haste without doing any harm to his rival
the brass pestle he caught up instinctively without knowing why he did it he would have struck him pushed him away perhaps
nothing more for he had no thought and no time to spare for that what he wanted to know was where she was
the mere sight of the father_zossima who had hated him from his childhood had been his enemy his persecutor and now his unnatural rival was enough
but his father_zossima his father_zossima a feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily irresistibly clouding his reason it all surged up in one moment
it was an impulse of madness and insanity but also an impulse of nature irresistibly and unconsciously like everything in nature avenging the violation of its eternal laws
but the prisoner even then did not murder him i maintain that i cry that aloud no he only brandished the pestle in a burst of indignant disgust not meaning to kill him not knowing that he would kill him
had he not had this fatal pestle in his hand he would have only knocked his father_zossima down perhaps but would not have killed him
as he ran away he did not know whether he had killed the old man such a murder is not a murder
such a murder is not a parricide no the murder of such a father_zossima cannot be called parricide such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by prejudice
but i appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul did this murder actually take place
gentlemen of the jury if we convict and punish him he will say to himself these people have done nothing for my bringing up for my education nothing to improve my lot nothing to make me better nothing to make me a man
these people have not given me to eat and to drink have not visited me in prison and nakedness and here they have sent me to penal servitude
i am quits i owe them nothing now and owe no one anything for ever they are wicked and i will be wicked
and i swear by finding him guilty you will only make it easier for him you will ease his conscience he will curse the blood he has shed and will not regret it
at the same time you will destroy in him the possibility of becoming a new man for he will remain in his wickedness and blindness all his life
but do you want to punish him fearfully terribly with the most awful punishment that could be imagined and at the same time to save him and regenerate his soul
they are cruel and i will be cruel that is what he will say gentlemen of the jury if so overwhelm him with your mercy
you will see you will hear how he will tremble and be horror struck how can i endure this mercy how can i endure so much love
am i worthy of it that what he will exclaim oh i know i know that heart that wild but grateful heart gentlemen of the jury
it will bow before your mercy it thirsts for a great and loving action it will melt and mount upwards there are soul which in their limitation blame the whole world
but subdue such a soul with mercy show it love and it will curse its past for there are many good impulses in it
such a heart will expand and see that god is merciful and that man are good and just he will be horror stricken he will be crushed by remorse and the vast obligation laid upon him henceforth
and he will not say then i am quits but will say i am guilty in the sight of all man and am more unworthy than all
with tears of penitence and poignant tender anguish he will exclaim others are better than i they wanted to save me not to ruin me
oh this act of mercy is so easy for you for in the absence of anything like real evidence it will be too awful for you to pronounce yes he is guilty
better acquit ten guilty man than punish one innocent man do you hear do you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our glorious history
it is not for an insignificant person like me to remind you that the russian court does not exist for the punishment only but also for the salvation of the criminal
let other nations think of retribution and the letter of the law we will cling to the spirit and the meaning the salvation and the reformation of the lost
if this is true if russia and her justice are such she may go forward with good cheer do not try to scare us with your frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand aside in disgust
not a runaway troika but the stately chariot of russia will move calmly and majestically to its goal in your hands is the fate of my client in your hands is the fate of russian justice
you will defend it you will save it you will prove that there are man to watch over it that it is in good hands
chapter xiv the peasants stand firm this was how fetyukovitch concluded his speech and the enthusiasm of the audience burst like an irresistible storm
it was out of the question to stop it the women wept many of the man wept too even two important personages shed tears
the president submitted and even postponed ringing his bell the suppression of such an enthusiasm would be the suppression of something sacred as the lady cried afterwards
the orator himself was genuinely touched and it was at this moment that ippolit_kirillovitch got up to make certain objections
people looked at him with hatred what what the meaning of it he positively dares to make objections the lady babbled
but if the whole world of lady including his wife had protested he could not have been stopped at that moment
he was pale he was shaking with emotion his first phrases were even unintelligible he gasped for breath could hardly speak clearly lost the thread
but he soon recovered himself of this new speech of his i will quote only a few sentences i am reproached with having woven a romance
but what is this defense if not one romance on the top of another all that was lacking was poetry fyodor_pavlovitch_karamazov while waiting for his mistress tears open the envelope and throws it on the floor
we are even told what he said while engaged in this strange act is not this a flight of fancy and what proof have we that he had taken out the money
the weak minded idiot smerdyakov transformed into a byronic hero avenging society for his illegitimate birth isnt this a romance in the byronic style
and the son who breaks into his father_zossima house and murders him without murdering him is not even a romance this is a sphinx setting us a riddle which he cannot solve himself
if he murdered him he murdered him and what the meaning of his murdering him without having murdered him who can make head or tail of this
then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and sound ideas and from this tribune of sound ideas is heard a solemn declaration that to call the murder of a father_zossima parricide is nothing but a prejudice
but if parricide is a prejudice and if every child is to ask his father_zossima why he is to love him what will become of us
who heard what he said what will become of the foundations of society what will become of the family parricide it appears is only a bogy of moscow merchants wives
the most precious the most sacred guarantees for the destiny and future of russian justice are presented to us in a perverted and frivolous form simply to attain an object to obtain the justification of something which cannot be justified
oh crush him by mercy cries the counsel for the defense but that all the criminal wants and to morrow it will be seen how much he is crushed
and is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking only for the acquittal of the prisoner why not found a charity in the honor of the parricide to commemorate his exploit among future generations
religion and the gospel are corrected that all mysticism we are told and ours is the only true christianity which has been subjected to the analysis of reason and common sense
so it shall be meted unto you again cried the counsel for the defense and instantly deduces that church_of_christ teaches us to measure as it is measured to us and this from the tribune of truth and sound sense
we peep into the gospel only on the eve of making speeches in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance with what is anyway a rather original composition which may be of use to produce a certain effect all to serve the purpose
and so they set up before us a false semblance of church_of_christ what measure ye mete but what church_of_christ commands us is something very different
he bids us beware of doing this because the wicked world does this but we ought to forgive and to turn the other cheek and not to measure to our persecutors as they measure to us
this is what our god has taught us and not that to forbid child to murder their fathers is a prejudice
correct the gospel of our lord whom the counsel for the defense deigns to call only the crucified lover of humanity in opposition to all orthodox russia which calls to him for thou art our god
at this the president intervened and checked the over zealous speaker begging him not to exaggerate not to overstep the bounds and so on as presidents always do in such cases
and we will not from the tribune of truth and good sense the audience too was uneasy the public was restless there were even exclamations of indignation
fetyukovitch did not so much as reply he only mounted the tribune to lay his hand on his heart and with an offended voice utter a few words full of dignity
he only touched again lightly and ironically on romancing and psychology and in an appropriate place quoted jupiter you are angry therefore you are wrong which provoked a burst of approving laughter in the audience for ippolit_kirillovitch was by no means like jupiter
then propos of the accusation that he was teaching the young generation to murder their fathers fetyukovitch observed with great dignity that he would not even answer
as for the prosecutor charge of uttering unorthodox opinions fetyukovitch hinted that it was a personal insinuation and that he had expected in this court to be secure from accusations damaging to my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject
but at these words the president pulled him up too and fetyukovitch concluded his speech with a bow amid a hum of approbation in the court
and ippolit_kirillovitch was in the opinion of our lady crushed for good then the prisoner was allowed to speak
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov stood up but said very little he was fearfully exhausted physically and mentally the look of strength and independence with which he had entered in the morning had almost disappeared
he seemed as though he had passed through an experience that day which had taught him for the rest of his life something very important he had not understood till then
his voice was weak he did not shout as before in his words there was a new note of humility defeat and submission
what am i to say gentlemen of the jury the hour of judgment has come for me i feel the hand of god upon me
the end has come to an erring man but before god i repeat to you i am innocent of my father_zossima blood
for the last time i repeat it wasnt i killed him i was erring but i loved what is good every instant i strove to reform but
i thank the prosecutor he told me many things about myself that i did not know but it not true that i killed my father_zossima the prosecutor is mistaken
i lived like a wild beast i thank my counsel too i cried listening to him but it not true that i killed my father_zossima and he neednt have supposed it
and dont believe the doctors i am perfectly sane only my heart is heavy if you spare me if you let me go i will pray for you
i will be a better man i give you my word before god i will and if you will condemn me i ll break my sword over my head myself and kiss the pieces
but spare me do not rob me of my god i know myself i shall rebel my heart is heavy gentlemen spare me
he almost fell back in his place his voice broke he could hardly articulate the last phrase then the judges proceeded to put the questions and began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions
but i will not describe the details at last the jury rose to retire for consultation the president was very tired and so his last charge to the jury was rather feeble
be impartial dont be influenced by the eloquence of the defense but yet weigh the arguments remember that there is a great responsibility laid upon you and so on and so on
the jury withdrew and the court adjourned people could get up move about exchange their accumulated impressions refresh themselves at the buffet
it was very late almost one clock in the night but nobody went away the strain was so great that no one could think of repose
all waited with sinking hearts though that is perhaps too much to say for the lady were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their hearts were untroubled
an acquittal they thought was inevitable they all prepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm i must own there were many among the man too who were convinced that an acquittal was inevitable
some were pleased others frowned while some were simply dejected not wanting him to be acquitted fetyukovitch himself was confident of his success
there are he said to one group as i was told afterwards there are invisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the jury
he was surrounded by people congratulating him and fawning upon him one feels during one speech if they are being formed
what will our peasants say now said one stout cross looking pock marked gentleman a landowner of the neighborhood approaching a group of gentlemen engaged in conversation
i was aware of them they exist our cause is won set your mind at rest but they are not all peasants
there are four government clerks among them yes there are clerks said a member of the district council joining the group
and do you know that nazaryev the merchant with the medal a juryman what of him he is a man with brains
but he never speaks he is no great talker but so much the better there no need for the petersburg man to teach him he could teach all petersburg himself
he the father_zossima of twelve child think of that upon my word you dont suppose they wont acquit him one of our young officials exclaimed in another group
they ll acquit him for certain said a resolute voice it would be shameful disgraceful not to acquit him cried the official
suppose he did murder him there are fathers and fathers and besides he was in such a frenzy he really may have done nothing but swing the pestle in the air and so knocked the old man down
if i been in fetyukovitch place i should simply have said straight out he murdered him but he is not guilty hang it all
but it was a pity they dragged the valet in that was simply an absurd theory that what he did only without saying hang it all
why gentlemen in lent an actress was acquitted in our town who had cut the throat of her lover lawful wife
no mihail_makarovitch semyonovitch he almost said that too put in a third voice oh but she did not finish cutting it
that makes no difference she began cutting it what did you think of what he said about child splendid wasnt it
splendid and about mysticism too oh drop mysticism do cried some one else think of ippolit_kirillovitch and his fate from this day forth
his wife will scratch his eye out to morrow for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov sake is she here what an idea if she been here she have scratched them out in court
she is at home with toothache he he he he he he in a third group i dare say they will acquit mitenka after all
i should not be surprised if he turns the metropolis upside down to morrow he will be drinking for ten day
oh the devil the devil bound to have a hand in it where should he be if not here
well gentlemen i admit it was eloquent but still it not the thing to break your father_zossima head with a pestle
or what are we coming to the chariot do you remember the chariot yes he turned a cart into a chariot
and to morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart just to suit his purpose what cunning chaps there are nowadays
is there any justice to be had in russia but the bell rang the jury deliberated for exactly an hour neither more nor less
a profound silence reigned in the court as soon as the public had taken their seats i remember how the jurymen walked into the court
i remember only the answer to the president first and chief question did the prisoner commit the murder for the sake of robbery and with premeditation
at last i wont repeat the questions in order and indeed i have forgotten them i dont remember the exact words
the foreman of the jury the youngest of the clerks pronounced in a clear loud voice amidst the deathlike stillness of the court yes guilty
there was a complete hush and the same answer was repeated to every question yes guilty and without the slightest extenuating comment
this no one had expected almost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy at least the deathlike silence in the court was not broken
all seemed petrified those who desired his conviction as well as those who had been eager for his acquittal but that was only for the first instant and it was followed by a fearful hubbub
many of the man in the audience were pleased some were rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal their joy
those who disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed shrugged their shoulders whispered but still seemed unable to realize this but how shall i describe the state the lady were in
i thought they would create a riot at first they could scarcely believe their ears then suddenly the whole court rang with exclamations
what the meaning of it what next they leapt up from their places they seemed to fancy that it might be at once reconsidered and reversed
at that instant mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly stood up and cried in a heartrending voice stretching his hands out before him i swear by god and the dreadful day of judgment
i am not guilty of my father_zossima blood katya i forgive you brothers friends have pity on the other woman
he could not go on and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that was heard all over the court in a strange unnatural voice unlike his own
from the farthest corner at the back of the gallery came a piercing shriek it was grushenka she had succeeded in begging admittance to the court again before the beginning of the lawyers speeches
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was taken away the passing of the sentence was deferred till next day the whole court was in a hubbub
but i did not wait to hear i only remember a few exclamations i heard on the steps as i went out
he ll have a twenty years trip to the mines not less well our peasants have stood firm and have done for our mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
epilogue chapter i plans for mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov escape very early at nine clock in the morning five day after the trial alyosha_karamazov went to katerina_ivanovna to talk over a matter of great importance to both of them and to give her a message
she sat and talked to him in the very room in which she had once received grushenka in the next room ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov lay unconscious in a high fever
katerina_ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and unconscious man to be carried to her house disregarding the inevitable gossip and general disapproval of the public
one of the two relations who lived with her had departed to moscow immediately after the scene in court the other remained
but if both had gone away katerina_ivanovna would have adhered to her resolution and would have gone on nursing the sick man and sitting by him day and night
the famous doctor had gone back to moscow refusing to give an opinion as to the probable end of the illness
though the doctors encouraged katerina_ivanovna and alyosha_karamazov it was evident that they could not yet give them positive hopes of recovery
but this time he had specially urgent business and he foresaw how difficult it would be to approach the subject yet he was in great haste
varvinsky and herzenstube were attending him alyosha_karamazov came to see his sick brother twice a day he had another engagement that could not be put off for that same morning and there was need of haste
they had been talking for a quarter of an hour katerina_ivanovna was pale and terribly fatigued yet at the same time in a state of hysterical excitement
she had a presentiment of the reason why alyosha_karamazov had come to her dont worry about his decision she said with confident emphasis to alyosha_karamazov
that unhappy man that hero of honor and principle not he not dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov but the man lying the other side of that door who has sacrificed himself for his brother katya added with flashing eye told me the whole plan of escape long ago
one way or another he is bound to come to it he must escape you know he has already entered into negotiations
you see it will probably come off at the third étape from here when the party of prisoners is being taken to siberia
i ve told you something already oh it a long way off yet ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has already visited the superintendent of the third étape
but we dont know yet who will be in charge of the party and it impossible to find that out so long beforehand
to morrow perhaps i will show you in detail the whole plan which ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov left me on the eve of the trial in case of need
that was when do you remember you found us quarreling he had just gone down stairs but seeing you i made him come back do you remember
do you know what we were quarreling about then no i dont said alyosha_karamazov of course he did not tell you
he had told me the main idea three day before and we began quarreling about it at once and quarreled for three day
we quarreled because when he told me that if dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov were convicted he would escape abroad with that creature i felt furious at once i cant tell you why i dont know myself
it was about that plan of escape why oh of course i was furious then about that creature and that she too should go abroad with dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
as soon as ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov saw that i was furious about that woman he instantly imagined i was jealous of dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov and that i still loved dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
katerina_ivanovna exclaimed suddenly her lips quivering with anger that is how our first quarrel began i would not give an explanation i could not ask forgiveness
i could not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving that and when i myself had told him long before that i did not love dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov that i loved no one but him
three day later on the evening you came he brought me a sealed envelope which i was to open at once if anything happened to him
he told me that the envelope contained the details of the escape and that if he died or was taken dangerously ill i was to save mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov alone
it was only resentment against that creature that made me angry with him oh he foresaw his illness then he left me money nearly ten thousand
those notes to which the prosecutor referred in his speech having learnt from some one that he had sent them to be changed
i was tremendously impressed to find that ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov had not given up his idea of saving his brother and was confiding this plan of escape to me though he was still jealous of me and still convinced that i loved mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov
i wanted to fall at his feet in reverence but i thought at once that he would take it only for my joy at the thought of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov being saved and he certainly would have imagined that
and i was so exasperated at the mere possibility of such an unjust thought on his part that i lost my temper again and instead of kissing his feet flew into a fury again
oh that was a sacrifice no you cannot understand the greatness of such self sacrifice alexey_fyodorovitch_karamazov ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov oh i am unhappy it my character my awful unhappy character
oh you will see i shall end by driving him too to abandon me for another with whom he can get on better like dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov
and when you came in then and when i called to you and told him to come back i was so enraged by the look of contempt and hatred
he turned on me that do you remember i cried out to you that it was he he alone who had persuaded me that his brother dmitri_fyodorovitch_karamazov was a murderer
but no i could not bear it i should kill myself i said that malicious thing on purpose to wound him again
he had never never persuaded me that his brother was a murderer on the contrary it was i who persuaded him
he wanted to show me that he was an honorable man and that even if i loved his brother he would not ruin him for revenge or jealousy
oh my vile temper was the cause of everything i paved the way to that hideous scene at the trial so he came to the court
katya never had made such confessions to alyosha_karamazov before and he felt that she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief
oh alyosha_karamazov knew another terrible reason of her present misery though she had carefully concealed it from him during those day since the trial but it would have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought so low as to speak to him now about that
she was suffering for her treachery at the trial and alyosha_karamazov felt that her conscience was impelling her to confess it to him to him alyosha_karamazov with tears and cries and hysterical writhings on the floor
i am the cause of it all i alone am to blame but he dreaded that moment and longed to spare her
it made the commission on which he had come even more difficult he spoke of mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov again it all right it all right dont be anxious about him
she began again sharply and stubbornly all that is only momentary i know him i know his heart only too well
you may be sure he will consent to escape it not as though it would be immediately he will have time to make up his mind to it
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov will be well by that time and will manage it all himself so that i shall have nothing to do with it
dont be anxious he will consent to run away he has agreed already do you suppose he would give up that creature
and they wont let her go to him so he is bound to escape it you he most afraid of he is afraid you wont approve of his escape on moral grounds
he talks about some hymn she went on again some cross he has to bear some duty i remember ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov told me a great deal about it and if you knew how he talked
katya cried suddenly with feeling she could not repress if you knew how he loved that wretched man at the moment he told me and how he hated him perhaps at the same moment
but you must generously allow it if your sanction is so necessary katya added viciously she paused and smiled and i heard his story and his tears with sneering disdain
brute yes i am a brute i am responsible for his fever but that man in prison is incapable of suffering katya concluded irritably
can such a man suffer man like him never suffer there was a note of hatred and contemptuous repulsion in her words
and yet it was she who had betrayed him perhaps because she feels how she wronged him she hates him at moments alyosha_karamazov thought to himself
he hoped that it was only at moments in katya last words he detected a challenging note but he did not take it up
i sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade him yourself or do you too consider that to escape would be dishonorable cowardly or something unchristian perhaps
katya added even more defiantly oh no i ll tell him everything muttered alyosha_karamazov he asks you to come and see him to day he blurted out suddenly looking her steadily in the face
she started and drew back a little from him on the sofa me can that be she faltered turning pale
it can and ought to be alyosha_karamazov began emphatically growing more animated he needs you particularly just now i would not have opened the subject and worried you if it were not necessary
it is not to be reconciled with you that he wants you but only that you would go and show yourself at his door
he is ill he is beside himself he keeps asking for you so much has happened to him since that day
he does not ask your forgiveness it impossible to forgive me he says himself but only that you would show yourself in his doorway
he realizes that he has injured you beyond all reckoning it so sudden faltered katya i ve had a presentiment all these day that you would come with that message
only think he realizes for the first time how he has wounded you the first time in his life he had never grasped it before so fully
i knew he would ask me to come it impossible let it be impossible but do it he said if she refuses to come i shall be unhappy all my life
do you hear though he is condemned to penal servitude for twenty years he is still planning to be happy is not that piteous
think you must visit him though he is ruined he is innocent broke like a challenge from alyosha_karamazov his hands are clean there is no blood on them
for the sake of his infinite sufferings in the future visit him now go greet him on his way into the darkness stand at his door
that is all you ought to do it you ought to alyosha_karamazov concluded laying immense stress on the word ought
i ought to but i cannot katya moaned he will look at me i cant your eye ought to meet
how will you live all your life if you dont make up your mind to do it now better suffer all my life
you ought to go you ought to go alyosha_karamazov repeated with merciless emphasis but why to day why at once
i cant leave our patient you can for a moment it will only be a moment if you dont come he will be in delirium by to night
i would not tell you a lie have pity on him have pity on me katya said with bitter reproach and she burst into tears
then you will come said alyosha_karamazov firmly seeing her tears i ll go and tell him you will come directly
no dont tell him so on any account cried katya in alarm i will come but dont tell him beforehand for perhaps i may go but not go in
i dont know yet her voice failed her she gasped for breath alyosha_karamazov got up to go and what if i meet any one
she said suddenly in a low voice turning white again that just why you must go now to avoid meeting any one
there will be no one there i can tell you that for certain we will expect you he concluded emphatically and went out of the room
the day after his fate was determined mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov had fallen ill with nervous fever and was sent to the prison division of the town hospital
but at the request of several person alyosha_karamazov madame_hohlakov lise etc doctor varvinsky had put mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov not with other prisoners but in a separate little room the one where smerdyakov had been
it is true that there was a sentinel at the other end of the corridor and there was a grating over the window so that varvinsky could be at ease about the indulgence he had shown which was not quite legal indeed but he was a kind hearted and compassionate young man
he knew how hard it would be for a man like mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov to pass at once so suddenly into the society of robbers and murderers and that he must get used to it by degrees
chapter ii for a moment the lie becomes truth he hurried to the hospital where mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was lying now the visits of relations and friends were informally sanctioned by the doctor and overseer and even by the police captain
but only alyosha_karamazov and grushenka had visited mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov mr_rakitin had tried to force his way in twice but mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov persistently begged varvinsky not to admit him
alyosha_karamazov found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing gown rather feverish with a towel soaked in vinegar and water on his head
he looked at alyosha_karamazov as he came in with an undefined expression but there was a shade of something like dread discernible in it
he had become terribly preoccupied since the trial sometimes he would be silent for half an hour together and seemed to be pondering something heavily and painfully oblivious of everything about him
if he roused himself from his brooding and began to talk he always spoke with a kind of abruptness and never of what he really wanted to say
he looked sometimes with a face of suffering at his brother he seemed to be more at ease with grushenka than with alyosha_karamazov
it is true he scarcely spoke to her at all but as soon as she came in his whole face lighted up with joy
alyosha_karamazov sat down beside him on the bed in silence this time mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was waiting for alyosha_karamazov in suspense but he did not dare ask him a question
he felt it almost unthinkable that katya would consent to come and at the same time he felt that if she did not come something inconceivable would happen
alyosha_karamazov understood his feeling trifon_borissovitch mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began nervously has pulled his whole inn to pieces i am told he taken up the flooring pulled apart the planks split up all the gallery i am told
he is seeking treasure all the time the fifteen hundred roubles which the prosecutor said i hidden there he began playing these tricks they say as soon as he got home
serve him right the swindler the guard here told me yesterday he comes from there listen began alyosha_karamazov she will come but i dont know when
perhaps to day perhaps in a few day that i cant tell but she will come she will that certain mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov started would have said something but was silent
it was evident that he would have liked terribly to know what had been said but he was again afraid to ask
the news had a tremendous effect on him something cruel and contemptuous from katya would have cut him like a knife at that moment
this was what she said among other things that i must be sure to set your conscience at rest about escaping
if ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is not well by then she will see to it all herself you ve spoken of that already mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov observed musingly
and you have repeated it to grusha observed alyosha_karamazov yes mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov admitted she wont come this morning
he looked timidly at his brother she wont come till the evening when i told her yesterday that katya was taking measures she was silent but she set her mouth
she only whispered let her she understood that it was important i did not dare to try her further she understands now i think that katya no longer cares for me but loves ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov
does she broke from alyosha_karamazov perhaps she does not only she is not coming this morning mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov hastened to explain again i asked her to do something for me
you know ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov is superior to all of us he ought to live not us he will recover would you believe it though katya is alarmed about him she scarcely doubts of his recovery said alyosha_karamazov
that means that she is convinced he will die it because she is frightened she so sure he will get well
ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov has a strong constitution and i too believe there every hope that he will get well alyosha_karamazov observed anxiously
yes he will get well but she is convinced that he will die she has a great deal of sorrow to bear
a silence followed a grave anxiety was fretting mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov alyosha_karamazov i love grusha terribly he said suddenly in a shaking voice full of tears
they wont let her go out there to you alyosha_karamazov put in at once and there is something else i wanted to tell you mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov went on with a sudden ring in his voice
if they beat me on the way or out there i wont submit to it i shall kill some one and shall be shot for it
and this will be going on for twenty years they speak to me rudely as it is i ve been lying here all night passing judgment on myself
i wanted to sing a hymn but if a guard speaks rudely to me i have not the strength to bear it
i am not ready i am not able to resign myself for grusha i would bear anything anything except blows
but she wont be allowed to come there alyosha_karamazov smiled gently listen brother once for all he said
this is what i think about it and you know that i would not tell you a lie listen you are not ready and such a cross is not for you
what more you dont need such a martyr cross when you are not ready for it if you had murdered our father_zossima it would grieve me that you should reject your punishment
but you are innocent and such a cross is too much for you you wanted to make yourself another man by suffering
i say only remember that other man always all your life and wherever you go and that will be enough for you
your refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel all your life an even greater duty and that constant feeling will do more to make you a new man perhaps than if you went there
for there you would not endure it and would repine and perhaps at last would say i am quits the lawyer was right about that
such heavy burdens are not for all man for some they are impossible these are my thoughts about it if you want them so much
if other man would have to answer for your escape officers or soldiers then i would not have allowed you smiled alyosha_karamazov
but they declare the superintendent of that étape told ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov himself that if it well managed there will be no great inquiry and that they can get off easily
of course bribing is dishonest even in such a case but i cant undertake to judge about it because if ivan_fyodorovitch_karamazov and katya commissioned me to act for you i know i should go and give bribes
i must tell you the truth and so i cant judge of your own action but let me assure you that i shall never condemn you
and it would be a strange thing if i could judge you in this now i think i ve gone into everything
but i do condemn myself cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov i shall escape that was settled apart from you could mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov alyosha_karamazov do anything but run away
but i shall condemn myself and i will pray for my sin for ever that how the jesuits talk isnt it
just as we are doing yes alyosha_karamazov smiled gently i love you for always telling the whole truth and never hiding anything cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with a joyful laugh
so i ve caught my alyosha_karamazov being jesuitical i must kiss you for that now listen to the rest i ll open the other side of my heart to you
if i run away even with money and a passport and even to america i should be cheered up by the thought that i am not running away for pleasure not for happiness but to another exile as bad perhaps as siberia
this is what i planned and decided it is as bad alyosha_karamazov it is i hate that america damn it already
she is russian russian to the marrow of her bones she will be homesick for the mother country and i shall see every hour that she is suffering for my sake that she has taken up that cross for me
even though grusha will be with me just look at her is she an american and what harm has she done
and how shall i too put up with the rabble out there though they may be better than i every one of them
i hate that america already and though they may be wonderful at machinery every one of them damn them they are not of my soul
i love russia alyosha_karamazov i love the russian god though i am a scoundrel myself i shall choke there he exclaimed his eye suddenly flashing
his voice was trembling with tears so this is what i ve decided alyosha_karamazov listen he began again mastering his emotion
as soon as i arrive there with grusha we will set to work at once on the land in solitude somewhere very remote with wild bears
there must be some remote parts even there i am told there are still redskins there somewhere on the edge of the horizon
so to the country of the last of the mohicans and there we ll tackle the grammar at once grusha and i work and grammar that how we ll spend three years
and by that time we shall speak english like any englishman and as soon as we ve learnt it good by to america we ll run here to russia as american citizens
dont be uneasy we would not come to this little town we hide somewhere a long way off in the north or in the south
the doctors shall make me some sort of wart on my face what the use of their being so mechanical or else i ll put out one eye let my beard grow a yard and i shall turn gray fretting for russia
i shall be changed by that time and she will too in america i dare say they wont recognize us and if they do let them send us to siberia
we ll work on the land here too somewhere in the wilds and i ll make up as an american all my life
i dont care it will show it our fate but we shall die on our own soil that my plan and it shant be altered
do you approve yes said alyosha_karamazov not wanting to contradict him mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov paused for a minute and said suddenly and how they worked it up at the trial
didnt they work it up if they had not you would have been convicted just the same said alyosha_karamazov with a sigh
yes people are sick of me here god bless them but it hard mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov moaned miserably again there was silence for a minute
alyosha_karamazov put me out of my misery at once he exclaimed suddenly tell me is she coming now or not
tell me what did she say how did she say it she said she would come but i dont know whether she will come to day
it hard for her you know alyosha_karamazov looked timidly at his brother i should think it is hard for her
alyosha_karamazov it will drive me out of my mind grusha keeps looking at me she understands my god calm my heart what is it
i want i want katya do i understand what i want it the headstrong evil alyosha_karamazov spirit no i am not fit for suffering
i am a scoundrel that all one can say here she is cried alyosha_karamazov at that instant katya appeared in the doorway
for a moment she stood still gazing at mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with a dazed expression he leapt impulsively to his feet and a scared look came into his face
he turned pale but a timid pleading smile appeared on his lips at once and with an irresistible impulse he held out both hands to katya
seeing it she flew impetuously to him she seized him by the hands and almost by force made him sit down on the bed
several time they both strove to speak but stopped short and again gazed speechless with a strange smile their eye fastened on one another
she sat down beside him and still keeping his hands pressed them violently so passed two minutes have you forgiven me
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov faltered at last and at the same moment turning to alyosha_karamazov his face working with joy he cried do you hear what i am asking do you hear
my forgiveness is no good to you nor yours to me whether you forgive me or not you will always be a sore place in my heart and
that what i loved you for that you are generous at heart broke from katya i in yours so it must be
she began again with nervous haste to embrace your feet to press your hands like this till it hurts you remember how in moscow i used to squeeze them to tell you again that you are my god my joy to tell you that i love you madly she moaned in anguish and suddenly pressed his hand greedily to her lips
she stopped to take breath what have i come for tears streamed from her eye alyosha_karamazov stood speechless and confounded he had never expected what he was seeing
love is over mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov katya began again but the past is painfully dear to me know that you will always be so
but now let what might have been come true for one minute she faltered with a drawn smile looking into his face joyfully again
you love another woman and i love another man and yet i shall love you for ever and you will love me do you know that
do you hear love me love me all your life she cried with a quiver almost of menace in her voice
i shall love you and do you know katya mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov began drawing a deep breath at each word do you know
five day ago that same evening i loved you when you fell down and were carried out all my life
so they murmured to one another frantic words almost meaningless perhaps not even true but at that moment it was all true and they both believed what they said implicitly
so it will be so it will always be katya cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov suddenly do you believe i murdered him i know you dont believe it now but then when you gave evidence
surely surely you did not believe it i did not believe it even then i ve never believed it i hated you and for a moment i persuaded myself
while i was giving evidence i persuaded myself and believed it but when i finished speaking i left off believing it at once
i have forgotten that i came here to punish myself she said with a new expression in her voice quite unlike the loving tones of a moment before
dont doubt that woman yours is a heavy burden broke as it were involuntarily from mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov let me go she whispered
i ll come again it more than i can bear now she was getting up from her place but suddenly uttered a loud scream and staggered back
katya moved swiftly to the door but when she reached grushenka she stopped suddenly turned as white as chalk and moaned softly almost in a whisper forgive me
grushenka stared at her and pausing for an instant in a vindictive venomous voice answered we are full of hatred my girl you and i_
grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room no one had expected her we are both full of hatred as though we could forgive one another
save him and i ll worship you all my life you wont forgive her cried mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov with frantic reproach dont be anxious i ll save him for you
katya whispered rapidly and she ran out of the room and you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgiveness herself
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov exclaimed bitterly again mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov dont dare to blame her you have no right to alyosha_karamazov cried hotly her proud lips spoke not her heart grushenka brought out in a tone of disgust
if she saves you i ll forgive her everything she stopped speaking as though suppressing something she could not yet recover herself
she had come in as appeared afterwards accidentally with no suspicion of what she would meet alyosha_karamazov run after her
mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov cried to his brother tell her i dont know dont let her go away like this i ll come to you again at nightfall said alyosha_karamazov and he ran after katya
he overtook her outside the hospital grounds she was walking fast but as soon as alyosha_karamazov caught her up she said quickly
no before that woman i cant punish myself i asked her forgiveness because i wanted to punish myself to the bitter end
she would not forgive me i like her for that she added in an unnatural voice and her eye flashed with fierce resentment
my brother did not expect this in the least muttered alyosha_karamazov he was sure she would not come no doubt
let us leave that she snapped listen i cant go with you to the funeral now i ve sent them flowers i think they still have money
if necessary tell them i ll never abandon them now leave me leave me please you are late as it is the bells are ringing for the service
they had waited for him and had already decided to bear the pretty flower decked little coffin to the church_of_christ without him
leave me please chapter iii ilusha funeral the speech at the stone he really was late it was the coffin of poor little ilusha
he had died two day after mitya_chapter_i_kuzma_samsonov was sentenced at the gate of the house alyosha_karamazov was met by the shouts of the boys ilusha schoolfellows
they had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last there were about twelve of them they all had their school bags or satchels on their shoulders
father_zossima will cry be with father_zossima ilusha had told them as he lay dying and the boys remembered it kolya_krassotkin was the foremost of them
how glad i am you ve come alyosha_karamazov he cried holding out his hand to alyosha_karamazov it awful here
snegiryov is not drunk we know for a fact he had nothing to drink to day but he seems as if he were drunk
it really horrible to see it i am always manly but this is awful alyosha_karamazov if i am not keeping you one question before you go in
what is it kolya_krassotkin said alyosha_karamazov is your brother innocent or guilty was it he killed your father_zossima or was it the valet
as you say so it will be i havent slept for the last four nights for thinking of it the valet killed him my brother is innocent answered alyosha_karamazov
that what i said cried smurov so he will perish an innocent victim exclaimed kolya_krassotkin though he is ruined he is happy
i could envy him what do you mean how can you why cried alyosha_karamazov surprised oh if i too could sacrifice myself some day for truth said kolya_krassotkin with enthusiasm
of course i should like to die for all humanity and as for disgrace i dont care about that our names may perish
but not in such a cause not with such disgrace and such horror said alyosha_karamazov i respect your brother
the boy who had once declared that he knew who had founded troy cried suddenly and unexpectedly and he blushed up to his ears like a peony as he had done on that occasion
and so do i alyosha_karamazov went into the room ilusha lay with his hands folded and his eye closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it
his thin face was hardly changed at all and strange to say there was no smell of decay from the corpse
the expression of his face was serious and as it were thoughtful his hands crossed over his breast looked particularly beautiful as though chiseled in marble
there were flowers in his hands and the coffin inside and out was decked with flowers which had been sent early in the morning by lise hohlakov
but there were flowers too from katerina_ivanovna and when alyosha_karamazov opened the door the captain had a bunch in his trembling hands and was strewing them again over his dear boy
he scarcely glanced at alyosha_karamazov when he came in and he would not look at any one even at his crazy weeping wife mamma who kept trying to stand on her crippled legs to get a nearer look at her dead boy
nina had been pushed in her chair by the boys close up to the coffin she sat with her head pressed to it
and she too was no doubt quietly weeping snegiryov face looked eager yet bewildered and exasperated there was something crazy about his gestures and the words that broke from him
old man dear old man he exclaimed every minute gazing at ilusha it was his habit to call ilusha old man as a term of affection when he was alive
father_zossima give me a flower too take that white one out of his hand and give it me the crazy mother begged whimpering
either because the little white rose in ilusha hand had caught her fancy or that she wanted one from his hand to keep in memory of him she moved restlessly stretching out her hands for the flower
i wont give it to any one i wont give you anything snegiryov cried callously they are his flowers not yours
everything is his nothing is yours father_zossima give mother a flower said nina lifting her face wet with tears i wont give away anything and to her less than any one
she took away his little cannon and he gave it to her the captain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how ilusha had given up his cannon to his mother
the boys seeing that the father_zossima would not leave the coffin and that it was time to carry it out stood round it in a close circle and began to lift it up
i dont want him to be buried in the churchyard snegiryov wailed suddenly i ll bury him by the stone by our stone
she didnt love ilusha the poor crazy creature was bathed in noiseless tears hiding her face in her hands ilusha told me to
he had been saying for the last three day that he would bury him by the stone but alyosha_karamazov kolya_krassotkin the landlady her sister and all the boys interfered
i wont let him be carried out what an idea bury him by an unholy stone as though he had hanged himself
one can hear the singing in church_of_christ and the deacon reads so plainly and verbally that it will reach him every time just as though it were read over his grave
the old landlady said sternly there in the churchyard the ground has been crossed he ll be prayed for there
the boys raised the coffin but as they passed the mother they stopped for a moment and lowered it that she might say good by to ilusha
but on seeing that precious little face which for the last three day she had only looked at from a distance she trembled all over and her gray head began twitching spasmodically over the coffin
at last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say take him where you will mother make the sign of the cross over him give him your blessing kiss him nina cried to her
but her head still twitched like an automaton and with a face contorted with bitter grief she began without a word beating her breast with her fist
they carried the coffin past her nina pressed her lips to her brother for the last time as they bore the coffin by her
as alyosha_karamazov went out of the house he begged the landlady to look after those who were left behind but she interrupted him before he had finished
to be sure i ll stay with them we are christians too the old woman wept as she said it
they had not far to carry the coffin to the church_of_christ not more than three hundred paces it was a still clear day with a slight frost
snegiryov ran fussing and distracted after the coffin in his short old summer overcoat with his head bare and his soft old wide brimmed hat in his hand
at one minute he stretched out his hand to support the head of the coffin and only hindered the bearers at another he ran alongside and tried to find a place for himself there
a flower fell on the snow and he rushed to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on the loss of that flower
the church_of_christ bells were still ringing he seemed in a state of bewildered anxiety and the crust of bread we ve forgotten the crust
but the boys reminded him at once that he had taken the crust of bread already and that it was in his pocket
he cried suddenly in dismay he instantly pulled it out and was reassured ilusha told me to ilusha he explained at once to alyosha_karamazov
i was sitting by him one night and he suddenly told me father_zossima when my grave is filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the sparrows may fly down i shall hear and it will cheer me up not to be lying alone
that a good thing said alyosha_karamazov we must often take some every day every day said the captain quickly seeming cheered at the thought
they reached the church_of_christ at last and set the coffin in the middle of it the boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so all through the service
it was an old and rather poor church_of_christ many of the ikons were without settings but such churches are the best for praying in
during the mass snegiryov became somewhat calmer though at time he had outbursts of the same unconscious and as it were incoherent anxiety
at one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it then he subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity
after the epistle he suddenly whispered to alyosha_karamazov who was standing beside him that the epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he meant
during the prayer like the cherubim he joined in the singing but did not go on to the end falling on his knees he pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while
at last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed the distracted father_zossima began fussing about again but the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul
he seemed suddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid short sobs which he tried at first to smother but at last he sobbed aloud
when they began taking leave of the dead and closing the coffin he flung his arms about as though he would not allow them to cover ilusha and began greedily and persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips
at last they succeeded in persuading him to come away from the step but suddenly he impulsively stretched out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin
he looked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him so that he apparently forgot his grief for a minute
gradually he seemed to sink into brooding and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up and carried to the grave
it was an expensive one in the churchyard close to the church_of_christ katerina_ivanovna had paid for it after the customary rites the grave diggers lowered the coffin
snegiryov with his flowers in his hands bent down so low over the open grave that the boys caught hold of his coat in alarm and pulled him back
when they began filling up the grave he suddenly pointed anxiously at the falling earth and began trying to say something but no one could make out what he meant and he stopped suddenly
and he was awfully excited snatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces and flinging the morsels on the grave
he did not seem to understand fully what was happening then he was reminded that he must crumble the bread come fly down birds fly down sparrows
one of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to crumble the bread with the flowers in his hands and suggested he should give them to some one to hold for a time
but he would not do this and seemed indeed suddenly alarmed for his flowers as though they wanted to take them from him altogether
and after looking at the grave and as it were satisfying himself that everything had been done and the bread had been crumbled he suddenly to the surprise of every one turned quite composedly even and made his way homewards
he muttered anxiously but his steps became more and more hurried he almost ran the boys and alyosha_karamazov kept up with him
the flowers are for mamma the flowers are for mamma i was unkind to mamma he began exclaiming suddenly some one called to him to put on his hat as it was cold
but he flung the hat in the snow as though he were angry and kept repeating i wont have the hat i wont have the hat
smurov picked it up and carried it after him all the boys were crying and kolya_krassotkin and the boy who discovered about troy most of all
though smurov with the captain hat in his hand was crying bitterly too he managed as he ran to snatch up a piece of red brick that lay on the snow of the path to fling it at the flock of sparrows that was flying by
half way snegiryov suddenly stopped stood still for half a minute as though struck by something and suddenly turning back to the church_of_christ ran towards the deserted grave
he missed them of course and went on crying as he ran but the boys instantly overtook him and caught hold of him on all sides
then he fell helpless on the snow as though he had been knocked down and struggling sobbing and wailing he began crying out ilusha old man dear old man
alyosha_karamazov and kolya_krassotkin tried to make him get up soothing and persuading him captain give over a brave man must show fortitude muttered kolya_krassotkin
you ll spoil the flowers said alyosha_karamazov and mamma is expecting them she is sitting crying because you would not give her any before
snegiryov suddenly recollected they ll take away the bed they ll take it away he added as though alarmed that they really would
ilusha little bed is still there yes yes mamma he jumped up and ran homewards again but it was not far off and they all arrived together
mamma poor crippled darling ilusha has sent you these flowers he cried holding out to her a little bunch of flowers that had been frozen and broken while he was struggling in the snow
but at that instant he saw in the corner by the little bed ilusha little boots which the landlady had put tidily side by side
seeing the old patched rusty looking stiff boots he flung up his hands and rushed to them fell on his knees snatched up one boot and pressing his lips to it began kissing it greedily crying ilusha old man dear old man where are your little feet
snegiryov opened the door hurriedly and called to his wife with whom he had so cruelly quarreled just before where have you taken him away
where have you taken him the lunatic cried in a heartrending voice nina too broke into sobs kolya_krassotkin ran out of the room the boys followed him
at last alyosha_karamazov too went out let them weep he said to kolya_krassotkin it no use trying to comfort them just now
do you know alyosha_karamazov he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them i feel dreadfully sad and if it were only possible to bring him back i give anything in the world to do it
let us wait a minute and then go back no it no use it awful kolya_krassotkin assented ah so would i said alyosha_karamazov
what do you think alyosha_karamazov had we better come back here to night he ll be drunk you know perhaps he will
let us come together you and i that will be enough to spend an hour with them with the mother and nina
if we all come together we shall remind them of everything again alyosha_karamazov suggested the landlady is laying the table for them now
there ll be a funeral dinner or something the priest is coming shall we go back to it alyosha_karamazov of course said alyosha_karamazov
it all so strange alyosha_karamazov such sorrow and then pancakes after it it all seems so unnatural in our religion
they are going to have salmon too the boy who had discovered about troy observed in a loud voice
i beg you most earnestly kartashov not to interrupt again with your idiotic remarks especially when one is not talking to you and doesnt care to know whether you exist or not
meantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly smurov exclaimed there ilusha stone under which they wanted to bury him
kolya_krassotkin snapped out irritably the boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply they all stood still by the big stone
alyosha_karamazov looked and the whole picture of what snegiryov had described to him that day how ilusha weeping and hugging his father_zossima had cried father_zossima father how he insulted you rose at once before his imagination
with a serious and earnest expression he looked from one to another of the bright pleasant faces of ilusha schoolfellows and suddenly said to them boys i should like to say one word to you here at this place
a sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul the boys stood round him and at once bent attentive and expectant eye upon him
i shall be for some time with my two brothers of whom one is going to siberia and the other is lying at death door
boys we shall soon part but soon i shall leave this town perhaps for a long time so we shall part
and whatever happens to us later in life if we dont meet for twenty years afterwards let us always remember how we buried the poor boy at whom we once threw stones do you remember by the bridge
let us make a compact here at ilusha stone that we will never forget ilusha and one another and afterwards we all grew so fond of him
he was a fine boy a kind hearted brave boy he felt for his father_zossima honor and resented the cruel insult to him and stood up for him
and even if we are occupied with most important things if we attain to honor or fall into great misfortune still let us remember how good it was once here when we were all together united by a good and kind feeling which made us for the time we were loving that poor boy better perhaps than we are
my little doves let me call you so for you are very like them those pretty blue birds at this minute as i look at your good dear faces
my dear child perhaps you wont understand what i am saying to you because i often speak very unintelligibly but you ll remember it all the same and will agree with my words some time
you must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than some good memory especially a memory of childhood of home
people talk to you a great deal about your education but some good sacred memory preserved from childhood is perhaps the best education
if a man carries many such memories with him into life he is safe to the end of his day and if one has only one good memory left in one heart even that may sometime be the means of saving us
perhaps we may even grow wicked later on may be unable to refrain from a bad action may laugh at man tears and at those people who say as kolya_krassotkin did just now i want to suffer for all man and may even jeer spitefully at such people
but however bad we may become which god forbid yet when we recall how we buried ilusha how we loved him in his last day and how we have been talking like friends all together at this stone the cruelest and most mocking of us if we do become so will not dare to laugh inwardly at having been kind and good at this moment
what more perhaps that one memory may keep him from great evil and he will reflect and say yes i was good and brave and honest then
and so in the first place we will remember him boys all our lives let him laugh to himself that no matter a man often laughs at what good and kind
but i assure you boys that as he laughs he will say at once in his heart no i do wrong to laugh for that not a thing to laugh at
the boys were excited and they too wanted to say something but they restrained themselves looking with intentness and emotion at the speaker
i say this in case we become bad alyosha_karamazov went on but there no reason why we should become bad is there boys
that only from thoughtlessness that will be so i understand you alyosha_karamazov cried kolya_krassotkin with flashing eye let us be first and above all kind then honest and then let us never forget each other
i say that again i give you my word for my part that i ll never forget one of you every face looking at me now i shall remember even for thirty years
but i cannot forget that kartashov exists and that he is not blushing now as he did when he discovered the founders of troy but is looking at me with his jolly kind dear little eye
boys my dear boys let us all be generous and brave like ilusha clever brave and generous like kolya_krassotkin though he will be ever so much cleverer when he is grown up and let us all be as modest as clever and sweet as kartashov
just now kolya_krassotkin said to kartashov that we did not care to know whether he exists or not but why am i talking about those two
you are all dear to me boys from this day forth i have a place in my heart for you all and i beg you to keep a place in your hearts for me
well and who has united us in this kind good feeling which we shall remember and intend to remember all our lives
who if not ilusha the good boy the dear boy precious to us for ever let us never forget him may his memory live for ever in our hearts from this time forth
let us remember his face and his clothes and his poor little boots his coffin and his unhappy sinful father_zossima and how boldly he stood up for him alone against the whole school
yes yes for ever for ever the boys cried in their ringing voices with softened faces we will remember we will remember cried the boys
he was brave he was good ah how i loved him exclaimed kolya_krassotkin ah child ah dear friends dont be afraid of life
how good life is when one does something good and just yes yes the boys repeated enthusiastically alyosha_karamazov we love you
a voice probably kartashov cried impulsively we love you we love you they all caught it up there were tears in the eye of many of them
hurrah for alyosha_karamazov kolya_krassotkin shouted ecstatically and may the dead boy memory live for ever alyosha_karamazov added again with feeling
alyosha_karamazov cried kolya_krassotkin can it be true what taught us in religion that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and see each other again all ilusha too
certainly we shall all rise again certainly we shall see each other and shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened
for ever the boys chimed in again alyosha_karamazov answered half laughing half enthusiastic ah how splendid it will be broke from kolya_krassotkin
well now we will finish talking and go to his funeral dinner dont be put out at our eating pancakes it a very old custom and there something nice in that
laughed alyosha_karamazov well let us go and now we go hand in hand and always so all our lives hand in hand
hurrah for alyosha_karamazov kolya_krassotkin cried once more rapturously and once more the boys took up his exclamation hurrah for alyosha_karamazov the end footnotes
